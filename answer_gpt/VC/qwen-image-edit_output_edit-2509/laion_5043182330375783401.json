      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial area is blurred, preventing a clear view of the facial features such as the mustache. Without visible details above the lip in the given area, it is not possible to determine the presence of a mustache.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face in Image B is intentionally blurred, which obscures any features that would indicate whether the eyes are open or closed.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's right arm is visually resting on the arm of the chair, not on the back of it. The arm's depiction, along with a clear posture of relaxation, suggests it is comfortably positioned either on the seat's armrest or in conjunction with the hand's positioning.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B is clearly seated on a chair, as indicated by the bent posture of the legs and the way the arm leans on the chair. This posture is typical of someone sitting down, with visual cues attesting to it.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible numbers or markings evident in the bottom right or any other corner of the image. The colorful and abstract background does not include details like numbers or text, unlike Image A where such might be present.",
