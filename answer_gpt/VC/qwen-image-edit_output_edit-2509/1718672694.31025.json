      "question": "Is the winding stone path composed of irregular flat stones leading upward toward the central structure present in the same location and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone path is present and appears to follow the same orientation leading upwards toward the structure as seen in Image A. The visual cues show that despite the addition of roots and ghostly figures, the path itself retains its position and orientation. This is derived from observing the path's alignment and continuation in both images.",

      "question": "Are the large, scattered rock formations visible along the grassy slope at the base of the structure preserved in their original positions and sizes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rock formations are visible and appear to be maintained in their positions and sizes at the base of the structure. This conclusion is drawn by observing their location relative to the structure and slope, which matches their placement in Image A.",

      "question": "Are the tall, leafy trees forming a natural border on both the left and right edges of the image still present, maintaining their original height, density, and positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees along the left and right edges are replaced by large tree figures with ghostly entities around them. While there are trees present, they are significantly altered in appearance and height compared to Image A, indicating changes in density and positioning.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B does maintain a pale blue color with clouds, similar to Image A. The overall lighting quality appears consistent between the two images, suggesting the preservation of daylight ambiance and cloud arrangement.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hillside still slopes gently upward from the foreground, covered in green grass, and continues to support the stone path and rocks in their original layout, as evident from the visual continuity and green coverage seen also in Image A.",
