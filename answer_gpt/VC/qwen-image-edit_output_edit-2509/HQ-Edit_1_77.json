        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a red vertical thread prominently descending from the central region of the neckpiece, a feature likely intended to enhance the visual symmetry and continuity of the design.

      ],

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observation of the edited image, beaded bracelets are visible on both forearms, retaining the consistent color pattern matching the necklaces: red, white, blue, and black.
