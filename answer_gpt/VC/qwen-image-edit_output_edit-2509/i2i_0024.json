        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon representation of the tennis player captures the pose with the right arm holding the tennis racket and the left arm raised, suggesting the same fist pump gesture as Image A, where the live-action player exhibits it. The cartoon maintains the identifiable posture typical of the celebratory fist pump seen in tennis.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a cartoon depiction focusing on the tennis player's character rather than the environmental elements like court lines. Unlike Image A, which shows clear white outlines on the clay court to define boundaries, the edited image does not emphasize a background that depicts a tennis court with such markings.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the player outfits include an orange dress and a white visor, retaining these basic colors and shapes. The edited image, though a cartoon, mirrors these color schemes to maintain recognition, celebrating the tennis attire in a simplified form.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a cartoon racket with essential details such as strings represented by lines, differing from a black-filled shape with minimal detail. This contrasts with the realistic depiction in Image A, which shows a tennis racket with full detailing including the strings and frame.",
