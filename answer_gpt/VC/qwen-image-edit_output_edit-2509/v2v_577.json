      "question": "Is the subject's hair dark brown and wavy in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is represented by a LEGO figure, which has a standard LEGO hairpiece that appears to mimic dark brown, wavy hair. LEGO figures typically do not have detailed hair texture, but rather a molded piece to represent hair. In this case, the hairpiece is designed to resemble the shape and color associated with dark brown and wavy. This is a representation rather than an exact replica of real hair texture.",

      "question": "Is the subject wearing a light blue shirt in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO figure donning a torso piece colored in a light blue shade, which simulates the appearance of wearing a light blue shirt. LEGO figures often use distinct colors to represent clothing items, and in this case, the light blue is consistent with the question's description.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a chest pocket on the left side of the subject's shirt in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO figure lacks specific detailing such as a chest pocket. LEGO torso pieces are generally simplistic and do not include complex or smaller components like a chest pocket unless explicitly designed onto the piece. Here, there is no indication of such a pocket.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the subject's hands positioned on the laptop keyboard in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO figure's hands are typically positioned in a static manner due to the structure of LEGO figures, which aligns with being on the laptop's vicinity given its placement. The hands seem to be near or on the surface where the keyboard would be represented on the LEGO laptop element.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the subject facing slightly to her right with her head turned toward the laptop in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO figure is facing directly forward towards the laptop, which suggests a direct alignment rather than a head turn to the side. LEGO figures generally have a fixed orientation and do not physically turn their heads slightly, indicating no particular side-facing position.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a laptop is prominently displayed on the desk in front of the LEGO figure. This is a common element in LEGO sets to represent work or technology scenarios. The presence of the laptop is clear and correlates to its placement in front of the subject.",
