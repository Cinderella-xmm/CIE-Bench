        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visual examination of Image B reveals that the cat has distinctive tabby patterns characterized by stripes and swirls on its face and body.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's eyes are observed to be a bright, vivid green, which is common in cats. This vividness is characterized by a striking, luminous color that stands out against the rest of the facial features. Given this visual cue and common knowledge about cat eye colors, it is clear that the eyes in Image B maintain their vivid green hue.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the cat's belly and chest areas are depicted in a lighter color, consistent with white fur. This is a common coloration pattern observed in many cats, where the underbelly and chest are white or a lighter shade. The visual cues indicate that the white fur on the chest and belly is preserved in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is displayed lying on a surface that resembles wood, as indicated by the texture and color typical of wooden floors. The posture of the cat appears relaxed, with limbs comfortably crossed and the body settled against the surface. This aligns with common relaxed poses seen in domestic cats lying on similar surfaces.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the fur of the cat displays a realistic texture, with individual hairs and shadows adding to the depth and realism. The lighting highlights certain areas, creating natural contrast and enhancing the visual detail of both the cat's fur and the wooden surface it lies on. This indicates that both the fur texture and the lighting effects are well-preserved.",
