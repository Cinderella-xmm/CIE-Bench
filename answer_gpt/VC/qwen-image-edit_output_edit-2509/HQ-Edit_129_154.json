      "question": "Are the floral and foliate engraved patterns visible on the body of the transformed owl, arranged symmetrically between vertical ribs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanical owl features an intricate design on its body, with layered and decorated metallic plates resembling feathers. However, the patterns do not resemble the floral and foliate engravings found on the teapot from Image A, nor are they arranged between vertical ribs. The owl's design is more complex and varied than simple floral motifs. Based on these observations, the transformed owl does not share the same pattern arrangement as the teapot.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the transformed owl retain a shiny, polished metallic surface consistent with the original teapot’s finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the owl as having a metallic surface, with parts reflecting light suggestive of a shiny finish. This aligns with the metallic sheen observed on the teapot in Image A, indicating that the mechanical owl does indeed retain a polished metallic surface similar to the teapot.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the beak of the mechanical owl shaped like the original teapot’s curved spout, extending forward and slightly upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beak of the mechanical owl has a pointed design but does not match the curved and elongated form of the teapot's spout, which extends forward and slightly upward. The owl's beak appears to be more integrated into the overall design without a similar curve to the spout. Therefore, the shape does not correspond closely to the teapot's spout.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the tail of the mechanical owl follow the same graceful C-shaped curve as the original teapot’s handle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl's tail is designed with a layered, feather-like appearance, rather than following a specific C-shaped curve pattern like the handle of the teapot in Image A. The tail extends more dramatically and has a different stylistic approach. Thus, the tail does not follow the same curve as the teapot’s handle.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the crown-like head of the mechanical owl include a pointed, tiered finial matching the original teapot’s lid top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the owl with a crown on its head rather than a finial. This crown does not have the same tiered structure as the finial atop the teapot's lid in Image A. The crown is more ceremonial than functional, differing significantly from the teapot's lid finial.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the body segments of the mechanical owl divided into vertical ribs, each housing a decorative motif, mirroring the original teapot’s structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no distinct vertical ribs on the mechanical owl's body similar to those on Image A's teapot. The owl's body design relies more on layers and textures reminiscent of feathers, rather than ribs, which house motifs on the teapot. Therefore, the structure does not mirror the teapot's design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the ornamental scrollwork present at the base of the mechanical owl’s tail, corresponding to the original handle’s end?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While ornamental details are present on the mechanical owl, Image B does not show scrollwork specifically at the base of its tail similar to that on the teapot handle in Image A. The owl's design is consistent with various ornamental details, but not scrollwork corresponding to the handle's end.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the tail of the mechanical owl rendered in a dark brown tone consistent with the original handle’s color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanical owl's tail and other parts show a metallic surface with varying tones. Image A shows the handle with a dark brown color, which does not prominently appear on the owl's tail in Image B. Therefore, the tail's coloration does not match the handle's tone.",
