      "question": "Is the bust oriented in a side profile facing to the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bust facing forward rather than in a side profile. The orientation is directed straight ahead, which can be observed by the alignment of the body and shoulders facing the viewer directly. Side profiles usually show one side of the shoulder extending further out than the other and are observed from an angled perspective.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an inscribed plaque visible on the base of the bust with the word 'APOLLO' clearly marked. This is evident from the visual detail in the lower portion of the bust, where the text is prominently displayed on a rectangular plaque attached to the base.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains similar proportions to Image A, where the neck, shoulders, and chest are consistent with a classical bust form structure. Both images feature a balanced proportion of these elements, highlighting an artistic representation typical of traditional sculpture.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drapery continues to extend from the left shoulder and crosses diagonally over the chest, just as observed in Image A. This design element is clearly depicted by the arrangement of folds from the shoulder toward the opposite side, mirroring classical drapery techniques.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base in Image B does not feature the cylindrical pedestal with a flat top and rounded bottom as seen in Image A. Instead, the base is more complex, incorporating mechanical elements that alter the traditional cylindrical design into a form incorporating clockwork gears.",
