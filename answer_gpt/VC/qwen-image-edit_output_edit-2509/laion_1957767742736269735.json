        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the turret of the tank does not show any visible white star or number '4'. The turret is built with green blocks. The visual analysis shows that the turret is made to resemble a tank using textured building blocks, without any additional markings such as stars or numbers.",
