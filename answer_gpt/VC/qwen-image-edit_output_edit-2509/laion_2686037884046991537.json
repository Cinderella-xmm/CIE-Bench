    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does each whoopie pie character retain a dark brown chocolate-colored outer layer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the whoopie pie characters are illustrated with a consistent dark brown color for their outer layer, resembling chocolate. This visual cue is clear from their shade and texture shown in the comic. Combining this with general knowledge of whoopie pies, which characteristically have chocolate-colored outer layers, the conclusion is that each character maintains this color.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a visible white cream filling between the two chocolate halves of each whoopie pie character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the whoopie pie characters evidently have a visible white section between their brown chocolate halves. Common sense knowledge about whoopie pies possessing a cream filling aligns perfectly with this in the visual of the cartoon. Observing the characters’ design shows a clear separation with white filling.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does each whoopie pie character maintain a two-layered structure with an inner filling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon characters are represented with a distinctly bimodal structure composed of two chocolate layers and an apparent inner white filling. This is consistent with the basic structure of traditional whoopie pies, thus it can be confirmed that the pies in the illustration retain this two-layered structure.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a white plate present beneath the whoopie pie characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the whoopie pie characters are drawn standing on a white plate. The comic illustrates them often oriented on top of what is visually discernible as a plate, as evident in both the first two panels. Common knowledge about tableware confirms this observation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are at least two whoopie pie characters positioned on the edge of the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, analyzing the placement of the whoopie pie characters reveals that at least two appear close to the plate’s edge, particularly noticeable in the second panel of the comic. It is reasonable, based on their relative position to the plate’s boundary.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all whoopie pie characters circular in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each whoopie pie character is depicted with a circular shape profile, consistent throughout the frames of the comic. Circularity is typical for whoopie pies, and each character follows suit as shown in the various positions depicted.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a clear contrast between the dark brown outer layers and the white inner filling of each whoopie pie character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color differential is evident between the brown and white sections of each whoopie pie character, making the contrast unmistakable. This aligns with the commonly known appearance of real whoopie pies, providing visual contrast.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Do the chocolate tops of the whoopie pie characters show signs of surface cracking or texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, unlike the real surface texture shown in Image A, the whoopie pie characters do not have visible signs of cracking on their tops. The characters are illustrated smoothly, reflecting a cartoon style where fine texture details are generally minimized.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
