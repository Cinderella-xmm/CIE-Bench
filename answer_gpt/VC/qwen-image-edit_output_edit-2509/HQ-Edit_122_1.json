      "question": "Is the vertical cluster of lavender-like flowers with fuzzy purple petals present in the same structural arrangement as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lavender-like flowers have a vibrant arrangement with fuzzy, purple petals in a vertical cluster, closely resembling the structure seen in Image A. The petals and flowers are visually consistent between both images, though Image B features an additional character interacting with the flowers. The presence of similar floral structures in both images suggests that the cluster has been maintained.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a single blue flower with a yellow center located at the top of the flower cluster?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue flower with a yellow center is visibly positioned at the top of the lavender-like flower cluster. This visual detail is consistent with Image A, where a single blue flower with a yellow center is found in the same position. This recurring floral feature in both images strongly indicates that it has been preserved in the edited version.",

      "question": "Is the butterfly positioned with its legs touching the flower stem, maintaining physical contact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B replaces the butterfly with a fairy-like creature, which is lovingly interacting with the flower by holding onto its stem. The original butterfly in Image A is indeed seen with its legs in contact with the flower stem. While the creature in Image B is not a butterfly, it maintains a similar interaction with the flower stem, suggesting a conceptual continuity of maintaining physical contact with the structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the wings of the butterfly fully spread in a side profile view, showing both left and right wings symmetrically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of a butterfly, there is a fairy-like creature with wings that are spread, although they are not symmetrical as would typically be seen in a butterfly's side profile. In Image A, the butterfly displays perfectly symmetrical wings in a full spread, adhering to the side profile perspective. Therefore, the butterfly's symmetry in wing display seen in Image A is not present in the edited Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighting in the image coming from above, casting a warm golden glow over the butterfly and flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears to emanate from above, casting a warm, golden hue over the fairy-like creature and surrounding flowers, creating a luminous atmosphere similar to that in Image A. This illumination style, which is consistently warm and golden across both images, reinforces the perception of lighting originating from an overhead source.",
