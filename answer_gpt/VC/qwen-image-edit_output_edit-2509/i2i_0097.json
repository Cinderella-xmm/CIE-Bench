      "question": "Does the plate retain its circular shape and raised rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central object is a circular cooking pot rather than a plate. It has a similar circular shape to a plate but includes two handles, suggesting it is used for cooking rather than as a plate. The raised rim of a plate is replaced by the sides of a pot. This is visually evident from the appearance of handles and the depiction of steam rising from the pot, which is typical of cookware rather than dishware.",

      "question": "Is the plate still white in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background object has been changed to an orange cooking pot, which is distinctively different from the white color of a plate. This is evident from the bright orange hue that contrasts with the typical white color of most plates.",

      "question": "Does the spoon retain its metallic finish and reflective surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spoon is depicted with a metallic finish and reflective surface, suggesting that it has not changed from its typical appearance. These features are visible through the glint and shine characteristics associated with metal objects, indicating that the spoon maintains its original material properties.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the spoon still oriented vertically on the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spoon is depicted vertically, but within the context of a cooking pot rather than a plate. This orientation is maintained, showing the spoon upright within the design. While the background has changed from a plate to a pot, the spoon's vertical placement remains consistent.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the plate and spoon still centrally positioned in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spoon remains centrally positioned within the composition, maintaining its alignment as the focal point. However, the plate is replaced by a cooking pot which now acts as the central background element. Nonetheless, both the spoon and the central object are positioned consistently with their initial central placement in Image A.",
