      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the fox retain its characteristic orange fur on the back and sides, white fur on the chest and muzzle, and black fur on the lower legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fox is depicted as a cartoon character, demonstrating the common traits typically associated with foxes like orange fur. However, the focus is more on its simplistic, stylistic representation rather than on maintaining the realistic detail of fur. The provided traits, such as orange fur on the back and sides along with any other specific details, are not pronounced or detailed in the chibi-style depiction. Comparatively, Image A depicts a realistic fox with detailed fur characteristics—orange fur on the back and sides, white on the chest and muzzle, and black on the legs.",

      "question": "Is the fox’s tail bushy and curled, ending in a clearly visible white tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fox's tail is shown in a simplistic, cartoon form, representing a bushy and curled style typical for foxes, emphasized by a white tip. In contrast, Image A shows a realistic bushy tail with a clear white tip, a characteristic feature seen in actual foxes.",

      "question": "Are there two monarch butterflies with orange and black wings hovering near the fox’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no butterflies present. Instead, the fox is surrounded by other cartoon animals, and attention is on speech rather than nature. In Image A, two lifelike monarch butterflies with distinct orange and black wings hover near the realistic fox's head, indicating their presence.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual focus is on a simplistic, illustrative scene with foxes in a stylized forest setting without realistic flora details like daisies. In Image A, however, small white daisies with yellow centers are visible, growing among the green moss. They fit with the natural, realistic depiction of the forest floor.",

      "question": "Is the ground covered in green moss with visible texture, especially beneath and around the fox?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a cartoonish style where the ground is stylized and does not show textural details like moss. Instead, it's more of a flat color representing grass or ground. In contrast, Image A features a realistic depiction of a forest floor covered in green moss with visible texture, particularly where the fox is seated.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a simplified cartoon background that doesn't suggest any detailed lighting effects, such as a glowing light source or rays. On the other hand, in Image A, there is a bright light source behind the trees, creating a natural glowing effect and casting sun rays through the foliage, enhancing the realistic forest ambiance.",
