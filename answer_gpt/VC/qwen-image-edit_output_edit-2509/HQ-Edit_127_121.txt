    "Question": "Q1: Is the circular orb-web with clearly defined radial and concentric threads still present and structurally intact?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the orb-web is indeed visible with its radial and concentric threads. The web’s structural design is coherent, although the central focus has shifted to highlight the edited subject (the butterfly-like creature), the orb-web structure remains largely intact around it. Therefore, despite the prominent creature in the center, the web maintains its defining features.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the branches positioned in a natural arc around the web, supporting it from multiple directions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the branches continue to arch around the web similarly to Image A. They are shown to support the web at various points along its perimeter, maintaining a natural and aesthetically pleasing formation. This positioning suggests they still provide structural support to the web, which aligns with real-world knowledge of how spider webs are anchored.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the leaves retain their oval shape, visible venation, and glossy surface texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves retain their oval shape as they appear visually similar to Image A. Their texture and venation continue to appear glossy, suggesting no alteration in the leaf characteristics despite the edits focusing on the spider-web scene. Thus, the features of the leaves remain consistent between the two images, maintaining their natural appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there small, clear water droplets visible on the surfaces of some leaves?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B closely, there appear to be some water droplets on the leaves, similar to Image A. This visual feature often enhances the realism of foliage in images, adding to the natural appearance of the scene despite the central fantastical element. Therefore, the water droplets are still present on some leaves.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the background a soft, uniform pale blue-gray sky without additional elements such as clouds or sun?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background retains a soft, pale blue-gray tone. There are no added elements like clouds or sun that interrupt the uniformity of the sky. This consistency in background color helps maintain focus on the central subject and the spider web, emphasizing the surreal aspect of the edited creature without altering the atmospheric setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the web’s radial threads visibly connected to the branch ends at multiple points?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the radial threads appear connected to various points along the branches, similar to the design in Image A. These connections demonstrate how the web is realistically attached and supported by the surrounding structure of branches. This detail aligns with common spider-web architecture in nature, reinforcing the web’s functional integrity in the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
