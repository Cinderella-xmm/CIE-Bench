      "question": "Are the golden tufted grasses clustered around the base of the cactus still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden tufted grasses can be seen clearly surrounding the base of the cactus-like structure. These tufted grasses are visually similar to those in Image A, indicating their continued presence. Thus, the original golden tufted grasses are still present around the base of the structure in the edited image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B also shows plants with a blue-gray hue near the base of the edited structure, similar to those in Image A. The presence of plants with this characteristic color suggests these succulents remain visible in the edited image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, underneath the transformed structure, the sandy ground with visible pebbles and similar soil texture is observable, like it is in Image A, reaffirming its presence in the edited image.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky maintains a gradient from pale to deeper blue, similar to Image A, suggesting the sky's gradient effect continues to exist in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the shadow of the cactus cast directly beneath it, aligned with the direction of midday sunlight, in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, though the central structure is altered, the shadow is visible and aligns with its shape, mirroring the still similar light source direction as noted in Image A thus confirming its midday casting directly beneath.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the upright, multi-armed silhouette of the cactus with a central trunk and multiple upward arms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

The silhouette is notably different, indicating the silhouette does not retain its original cactus form.",
