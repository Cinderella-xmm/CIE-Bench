      "question": "Are ocean waves present and breaking onto the sandy shore?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene appears abstract with stylized elements. The presence of ocean waves is depicted by a series of flowing lines and curves that mimic the movement of water. Although not realistic, the artistic representation suggests the concept of ocean waves, as seen in the swirling patterns indicative of water movement. In contrast, Image A clearly shows realistic waves breaking onto the sandy shore. The visual in Image B confirms the presence of waves, albeit in an abstract form.",

      "question": "Is the sandy beach present and curving from the foreground toward the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the style is abstract, with the suggestion of a sandy beach through the use of curving lines and wave-like forms. These lines do not distinctly represent a sandy texture but suggest motion typical of a beach. In Image A, the curving sandy beach is clear and realistic. Comparing both images, Image B interprets these elements abstractly, implying a beach-like curve. Therefore, even abstractly, it suggests a curving beach presence.",

      "question": "Are palm trees visible along the coastline on the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the abstract style may include vertical and curved lines that could be interpreted as representing palm trees. However, these lines do not distinctly resemble palm trees, lacking specific features like the typical palm fronds. In Image A, palm trees are clearly visible and distinct. Based on the abstract nature of Image B, the presence of palm trees is not explicitly clear, which points to their absence in the literal sense.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there three distinct rock formations visible in the foreground sand, clustered together near the right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the abstract representation of Image B, there are stylistic nods to natural elements, but no clear depiction of rock formations that are distinct or clustered together in the way that real rock formations would be understood. Image A, on the other hand, shows clear rock formations. Consequently, in Image B's abstract form, rocks are not distinctly visible.",

      "question": "Are footprints and ripple patterns visible in the wet sand near the waterâ€™s edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's abstract style uses lines and shapes to hint at natural textures but doesn't clearly show footprints or ripple patterns. This contrasts with Image A, where such details are distinctly visible. The abstraction in Image B lacks these specific features due to its nature, thus indicating their absence.",
      "weight": 2,

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the coastline visible as a curved line extending into the distance, with green hills rising behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's abstract representation includes curves and lines that suggest a coastline and possibly rising shapes indicating hills. However, these elements are not distinct in their representation as a realistic coast with green hills. Image A clearly shows these features. In the abstract representation, suggesting these details requires interpretation, but they are not clearly visible.",

      "question": "Is the sky visible above the horizon, featuring clouds with warm orange and pink tones near the horizon and transitioning to blue higher up?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's abstract nature includes colors that align with a stylized representation of the sky but lacks clear, realistic cloud formations and color transitions visible in a photograph like Image A. The abstraction gives a sense of sky and color gradient but does not vividly or literally depict the described sky details.",
