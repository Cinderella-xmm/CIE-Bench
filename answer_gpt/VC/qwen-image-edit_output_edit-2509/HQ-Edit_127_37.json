      "question": "Is the feathered plume still present on top of the knight's helmet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a knight character but in a chibi or miniature style, rather than realistic. This knight is encased within a glass dome, which imitates a decorative figurine. In this depiction, detailed elements such as a feathered plume would be significantly minimized or absent due to the simplified representation style of chibi figures. Furthermore, the level of detail typical in real-life knight's armor isn't typically reproduced in chibi figures due to their exaggerated simplistic style. Therefore, based on this chibi representation, a feathered plume is absent.",

      "question": "Is the rampant lion emblem clearly visible on the shield?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shield is part of a chibi knight figure displayed within a glass dome. In this form, such ornate details as a rampant lion emblem, which would be typical on a realistic medieval shield, are reduced or completely omitted due to the chibi style's characteristic simplification. The chibi representation generally emphasizes proportion and exaggeration over detailed intricacy. Based on visual observation and this knowledge, the rampant lion emblem is not present on the shield in the chibi depiction.",

      "question": "Is the knight holding a long spear or lance in their right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a chibi knight figure encased in a glass dome. The primary weapon associated with this figure is a shepherd's crook or staff rather than a long lance or spear, fitting with the whimsical and simplified style of chibi art. Since the figure is depicted in a collectible or toy-like manner, equipped with a shepherd's crook among sheep, there's no indication of a traditional knightly weapon such as a spear or lance being held.",

      "question": "Are the knight's pauldrons and greaves visibly present in the armor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi knight en miniature form is within the glass dome. Although the armor on the chibi figure retains key elements such as pauldrons (shoulder armor) and greaves (shin armor), their presence is not as detailed or prominent as realistic armor. The chibi style simplifies these features; however, the stylized representation includes these elements to convey the essence of a knight's armor.",

      "question": "Is the castle's main turret with a conical roof and flagpole still visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi dome does feature a small construction resembling a turret with a conical roof, possibly representing a miniature castle structure. It's not a precise replication of larger architectural features but gives a semblance of a castle theme. There is no flagpole visible atop this turret, aligning with the chibi and miniature style's reduced detail approach. Thus, a turret-like feature is present, yet lacks a flag or detailed resemblance to real-life structures.",

      "question": "Are strands of ivy hanging down from the top of the archway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no archway present; instead, there is a glass dome housing the knight and castle-like turret. The presence of decorative elements like ivy would not be typical or meaningful within this chibi and dome motif, focusing on the miniature knight and surrounding components. Based on the visual observation, ivy strands do not feature within the depicted scene.",

      "question": "Is the knight positioned facing toward the right side of the image, with the shield on the left arm?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi knight figure is observed from the front, showing a neutral perspective where they appear to be facing directly outward within the glass dome. The shield appears on the front left side, assuming an outward-facing position that could align with either arm configuration in this simplified style. However, the side the shield occupies suggests it is on the knight's left side, fitting the mentioned direction.",
