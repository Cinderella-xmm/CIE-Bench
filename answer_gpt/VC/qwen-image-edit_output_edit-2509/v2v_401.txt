Berries are commonly used for their visual and flavor profiles in desserts.

    "Question": "Q5: Does the image retain the relative positions and groupings of the desserts as in the original image?",
    "explanation": "The spatial arrangement in Image B forms a path to create a coherent narrative fitting the theme of a dessert treasure map, rather than the clustered display in Image A. In Image B, the items like cupcakes, macarons, croissants, and berries are artistically laid out along a path marked with dotted lines and other cartographic symbols.
