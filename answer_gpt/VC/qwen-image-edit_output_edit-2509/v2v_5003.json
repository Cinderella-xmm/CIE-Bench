      "question": "Does the edited image retain the curved shape of the bow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bow maintains its fundamental shape and is visibly curved, despite appearing more stylized or simplistic compared to Image A. Generally, bows have a distinctive curve to allow an arrow to be propelled effectively, and Image B aligns with this functional necessity. World knowledge of bow design supports the identification of this curve. Thus, Image B retains the curved shape, albeit in a more stylized form.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the cylindrical shape of the quiver?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quiver is displayed as an upright object with a circular cross-section, characteristic of a cylindrical shape. The key visual information—its upright position and circular top—is consistent with the typical design of a quiver, which is used to hold arrows. Image A reveals the same aspect, reinforcing the conclusion based on world knowledge concerning the purpose and typical design of quivers.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the arrangement and general form of the arrows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the arrows inside the quiver with their fletchings sticking out similarly to Image A. The positioning of arrows—sticking out from a cylindrical quiver in an orderly fashion—is typical for efficient storage and accessibility. Image B retains this arrangement and general form, indicating the arrows are meant to be used similarly in both images.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the position of the bow and quiver on the forest floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the bow and quiver are placed on what seems to be a natural ground covered in moss and leaves, resembling a forest floor, similarly to Image A. The positioning relative to each other, with the quiver upright and bow lying beside it, remains unchanged. Such placement suggests intended accessibility for an archer, supporting the reasoning through world knowledge of archery practice.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the natural woodland backdrop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a blurred background with shades suggesting natural light filtering through foliage, providing a natural woodland atmosphere similar to Image A. The blur signifies depth and distance typical of a forest environment, allowing one to infer the outdoor setting typical of woodland areas, enhanced by world knowledge about natural light and forest characteristics.",
