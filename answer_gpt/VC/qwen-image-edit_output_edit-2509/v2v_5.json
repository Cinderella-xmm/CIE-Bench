        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is depicted with the characteristic black-and-white striped pattern, similar to its representation in Image A.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a cake with a zebra-striped design. This is consistent with Image A, where the cake also features the zebra stripe pattern. This design is intentionally matched with the appearance of the zebra, serving as a thematic visual element within both images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is not shown in a position suggesting leaning forward toward the cake. Instead, the zebra is presented in a stylized and cartoonish manner, seated within a digital frame overlay. In Image A, the zebra is depicted leaning toward the cake on a table, showcasing an interactive moment.",
