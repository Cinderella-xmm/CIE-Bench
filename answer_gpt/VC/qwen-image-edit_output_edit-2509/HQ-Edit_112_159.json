      "question": "Does the car retain the distinctive angular LED headlights and central grille intake characteristic of the McLaren 720S?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car features angular LED headlights and a central grille intake, which are characteristics typical of high-performance cars like the McLaren 720S. The design elements, such as the sharp lines and aerodynamic features visible, align with the McLaren brand's design language. The reasoning combines the examination of visible design clues with the knowledge of McLaren automobiles.",

      "question": "Is the road still a curved two-lane highway with continuous double yellow lines running down its center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a road that continues to be a curved two-lane highway with continuous double yellow lines in the center, similar to a typical scenic coastal highway. These features are apparent from the road markings and the visible curvature leading into the diorama setup. The analysis pairs visual evidence of the road layout with general road design principles.",

      "question": "Is the left-hand hillside still present with its reddish-brown slopes and scattered autumnal vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left-hand side of the scene features reddish-brown hillside slopes with what appears to be scattered vegetation, reminiscent of autumn colors. This analysis comes from noting the coloration and texture of the depicted hillside, matched against common autumnal vegetation visuals.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a concrete guardrail along the right side of the road, separating it from the ocean?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not clearly show a concrete guardrail along the right side of the road. Instead, it appears to be represented by a diorama or model setup within a glass case. Although the scene maintains a road boundary, the traditional real-world elements like a concrete guardrail are replaced by the representation's constraints.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the car positioned centrally on the right side of the road, facing forward toward the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car is placed centrally within the depicted scene, facing forward, but due to the diorama's nature, its exact positioning relative to the road's right side isn't distinctively clear. The car appears more central to the composition rather than specifically on the right or left.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are rocky outcrops visible in the distant sea, with mist or spray rising near the shore?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background replicates scenic seascapes, including rocky outcrops and what resembles mist or spray effects, typical of waves breaking near the shore. This inference is drawn from examining background details in the diorama and relating them to common seascape imagery.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, looking through the windshield, the interior of the car reveals seats that are red with black accents, resembling racing seats. This conclusion is based on the visibility of color contrasts and the typical design features associated with racing or sports cars.",
