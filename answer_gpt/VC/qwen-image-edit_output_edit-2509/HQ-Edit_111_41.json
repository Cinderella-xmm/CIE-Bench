    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the chair supported by a five-star base with exactly five legs, each ending in a caster?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the chair is structured with five arms extending from a central hub, which is characteristic of a five-star base commonly found in office chairs for stability. Each of these arms appears to end in a circular piece, resembling a caster, though rendered in a blocky style to mimic a construction set. This visual design aligns with our understanding of a five-star office chair support structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a separate headrest cushion positioned directly above the main backrest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the backrest appears to maintain a continuous structure with the seat back, rather than having a distinct and separate headrest cushion positioned above the backrest like in conventional ergonomic chairs. This portion initially appears as an extended piece rather than a separate entity.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there two armrests, one on each side, extending horizontally from the chairâ€™s midsection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a chair with two armrests that are clearly present, extending outwards from the midsection of the chair on each side. These armrests are designed to resemble construction block pieces, clearly differentiating them from the seat and backrest. This aligns with the typical configuration of chair armrests.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the backrest vertically aligned behind the seat, rising from the same central axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backrest is shown as a vertical structure positioned directly behind the seat, maintaining alignment along the central axis from the base, typical of most standard office chairs. This arrangement ensures ergonomic support and stability.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the chair maintain a tall, high-back silhouette with the headrest significantly higher than the seat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a chair design where the backrest extends considerably upwards beyond the seat's height, creating a tall silhouette indicative of a high-back chair design. The distinct vertical extension above the seat mimics the design intent of high-backed office chairs to provide better back support.",
