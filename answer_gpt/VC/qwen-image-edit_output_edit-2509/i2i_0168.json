      "question": "Are the carrots depicted in a bright orange color with their rounded-tapered shape preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrots are visibly a bright orange color, characteristic of fresh carrots. Their rounded and tapered shape, typical of mature carrots, is clearly maintained, indicating that these are recognizable depictions of carrots. This is confirmed by their consistent and bold orange color in contrast with the white snowy background.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the carrots topped with bright green serrated leaves with a lobed appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows carrots with bright green foliage on top. The leaves have serrated edges and a lobed appearance, which are consistent with the natural leaf structure of carrot plants. This visual cue is a clear indication of a healthy carrot plant in typical vegetative growth.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the soil texture surrounding the carrotsâ€™ roots preserved showing they are rooted in soil rather than snow or ice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrots appear to be placed in a snowy environment, as evidenced by the snow covering around them and visible icebergs in the background. However, the area surrounding the carrot roots is distinctly depicted as soil, with its loose texture and dark color suggesting they are planted in soil. This juxtaposition highlights the carrots being rooted in soil despite the snowy surroundings.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the carrots positioned in a way that shows they are partially underground, consistent with their natural growth pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows carrots with the majority of their bodies underground, with only the upper portion visible above the soil. This is visually apparent from how the soil is piled around their sides, conforming to the typical way carrots grow with their roots buried underground while their tops are above the surface.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the carrots have visible surface textures like natural ridges or marks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrots display visible surface textures including ridges, which are typical markings created during their growth process. This realistic texture detail supports the authenticity of the carrot's appearance despite the surreal environment.",
