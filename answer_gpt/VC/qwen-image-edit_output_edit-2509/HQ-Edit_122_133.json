      "question": "Is the cardinal’s body predominantly bright red with a black facial mask?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal's body is represented in the form of a humanoid figure wearing clothing. The figure has a cardinal's head, with vivid red plumage covering the head and neck area, which correlates to the bird's body. It also includes the distinctive black facial mask associated with cardinals. This indicates that the imagery utilizes the cardinal's natural coloring into the attire, making the 'body' predominantly bright red. Therefore, the cardinal's body is designed to visually represent bright red, along with the iconic black mask on the face.",

      "question": "Does the blue jay have a blue crest and wings with alternating blue and white bars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue jay is depicted in a humanoid form, adorned with attire instead of its natural feathers. The head features the blue jay's blue crest, which is shown as part of the head design in both images. However, wings are replaced with clothing, and while the jacket is blue, it does not feature alternating blue and white bars commonly found on the natural wings of a blue jay, indicating the absence of visual cues for wings with such patterns.",

      "question": "Is there visible snow resting on the cardinal’s head and back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal is dressed in clothing typical of a human figure, with no indication of snow resting on its head or body. Instead, the surroundings emulate a snowy environment within the display box, but the cardinal itself is free from snow. This contrasts Image A, which shows visible snow on the cardinal bird, but such snow interactions are absent from the humanoid representation.",

      "question": "Does the blue jay have a black beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the humanoid representation of the blue jay features a bird head with a black beak, consistent with the real blue jay, which commonly has a black beak. This aspect is preserved in the design of the character within the use of bird features on the humanoid form.",

      "question": "Are the birds perched on snow-covered pine branches with visible needles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B represents the birds in humanoid forms inside boxes decorated with winter scenes rather than actual birds perched on branches. The ground and background within their display environment are covered with snow, and trees are visible, giving the impression of a snowy environment. However, the birds are not shown perched on pine branches with needles, differentiating from Image A, where they sit on actual snow-covered branches.",

      "question": "Does the cardinal have an orange-red beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cardinal in Image B has a head forming that of a cardinal bird, which features an orange-red beak consistent with the real cardinal. The depiction remains true to the bird's natural coloring, reflecting an orange-red beak in the design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal and blue jay are positioned in individual display cases, presumably implying separation in their presentation. Each case forms its own distinct vertical section, thus creating a similar visual separation effect as observed in Image A, where the birds are divided by a vertical line indicating separation.",
