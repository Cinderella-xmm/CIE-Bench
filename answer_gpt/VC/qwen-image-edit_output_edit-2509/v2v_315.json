      "question": "Does the echidna retain its detailed spines and naturalistic appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the echidna appears to have a simplified, stylized design with smoother and less detailed spines compared to a naturalistic appearance. The edited image features a more cartoonish depiction, which is characteristic of a chibi style. In contrast, Image A portrays the echidna with intricate detailing that reflects a more lifelike representation. Thus, in Image B, the echidna does not retain the detailed spines that emphasize naturalism.",
