    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the balance beam made of wood with visible wear and chipped paint?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is entirely abstract and artistic without realistic depiction, so there are no visible representations of a balance beam to analyze. The design focuses on the gymnast and abstract elements, not detailed materials. This differs from Image A where a wooden balance beam with visible wear and paint work is evident.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the gymnast maintain a handstand with her body arched backward and legs lifted vertically above her head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gymnast appears to be holding a pose where her body arches backward, and her legs are lifted forming a shape commonly associated with acrobatics or gymnastics. This corresponds with Image A, where a similar pose is held, illustrating a common gymnastic movement.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the leotard divided into silver upper body and blue lower body with a gradient transition and sparkles along the spine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a leotard design that matches the color scheme mentioned, with a clear division between the silver and blue areas. The presence of sparkles on the upper body is also visually depicted, resembling Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the gymnast’s hair styled in a tight bun secured with a blue hair tie?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although Image B is more of a stylized illustration, it still shows the gymnast having a hairstyle resembling a bun. However, the color details of the hair tie are not visible in such artistic representation, different from Image A where a blue hair tie is noticeable.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible chalk marks on the balance beam beneath the gymnast’s hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artistic representation does not include any explicit elements resembling a balance beam or chalk marks, as it is more focused on abstract depiction of motion and color rather than realistic textures.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a small stud earring visible on the gymnast’s left ear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The artistic style of Image B does not focus on intricate details such as earrings; facial and ear details are abstract with no visible earring represented, unlike Image A where such details could be discernible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the gymnast’s face turned sideways with her eyes looking downward toward the beam?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face is seen in silhouette which implies a side perspective but gives no clear indication of eye direction, unlike in Image A where the gymnast's face orientation and gaze can be analyzed.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are the gymnast’s hands placed flat on top of the beam, supporting her body in a handstand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the gymnast's hand position in a way consistent with a handstand, supported by the arm positioning, yet lacks the detailed depiction of a beam. This is unlike Image A where the hands are clearly seen in contact with the beam.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Are white gymnastic grips visible on the gymnast’s hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stylized image found in Image B lacks the detailing necessary to represent gymnastics equipment like grips; it focuses on outlines and colors rather than such accessories. In Image A, these might be visible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q10",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is an abstract design with patterns and colors, without any depiction of an audience or stadium elements that are visible in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
