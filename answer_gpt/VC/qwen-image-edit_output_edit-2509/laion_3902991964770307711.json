      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain exactly three arms—one central and two lateral—arranged symmetrically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object features three arms: one central and two lateral. Each arm is equally spaced and balanced around the central axis, which reflects symmetry. In the context of candlestick or similar objects, symmetrical arrangements are typical for balance and aesthetic appeal.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the left and right arms symmetrically positioned and shaped relative to the central axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the left and right arms extending from the central stem in a mirrored fashion, indicating symmetrical positioning. The curves of each arm are similar, which aligns with the common practice of creating balance in design by ensuring symmetrical elements relative to a central axis.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the base circular, flared, and adorned with a beaded or ridged edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the base is not visibly circular, flared, or adorned with a decorative edge. Instead, it appears as a cylindrical shape without distinctive embellishments such as beading or ridging on the perimeter. This differs from typical embellishments found in traditional candlesticks.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the central stem remain a tall, tapering vertical shaft connecting the base to the top arms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a more cylindrical central stem without tapering. It connects the base to the arms, but lacks the tall, tapering characteristic found in traditional candlestick designs, which typically includes a narrowing vertical shaft leading up to the arms.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the arms maintain smooth, curved trajectories from the central stem to the top ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arms exhibit smooth curves from the central stem to their endpoints. This is typical of designs that aim for elegance and fluidity in aesthetic appearance, especially in objects designed to display on mantles or tables.",
