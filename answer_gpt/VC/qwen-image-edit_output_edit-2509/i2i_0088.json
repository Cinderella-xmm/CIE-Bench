      "question": "Is the napkin still dark blue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the napkin appears to have a deep, rich blue color. This color is characteristic of a dark blue shade. The folds and texture of the napkin further contribute to its visual perception as a dark blue fabric, indicating that the color remains unchanged.",

      "question": "Are the napkin's fabric creases and texture preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows visible creases and a clear fabric texture similar to those found on a typical napkin. These attributes help confirm the preservation of the napkin's original form.",

      "question": "Does the new spoon occupy the same position on the napkin as the original fork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spoon is situated centrally on the napkin, mirroring the positioning seen in Image A with the fork. This suggests that despite the change from a fork to a spoon, the utensil remains in the same position.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question": "Is the background still a solid dark blue tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images feature a consistent dark blue background, suggesting continuity in tone across the alterations. The solid color forms a uniform backdrop that accents the napkin and utensil, evidence that the background retains its original hue.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shadows and lighting on the spoon and napkin consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is consistent with Image A, casting similar shadows on both the napkin and utensil. This reflects a uniform lighting setup, with reflections and shadows mimicking the originals, maintaining realism in the edited image.",
