      "question": "Do the nesting dolls maintain a triangular shape inspired by the pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nesting dolls are traditionally shaped as cylindrical figures with rounded tops, which is evident in Image B. This contrasts with the sharp, triangular shape of the pyramid in Image A. Nesting dolls are designed for ease of stacking and fitting within each other, resulting in their iconic cylindrical form. The pyramid has a pointed apex and large base, which does not match the round and smooth form of the dolls.",

      "question": "Do the nesting dolls retain the stone texture seen in the original pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nesting dolls in Image B have a smooth and glossy surface, typical of painted wood or plastic, characterized by vibrant colors and polished finishes. This is starkly different from the rough, stone texture of the pyramid in Image A, which is indicative of stone blocks used in its construction. The materials and textural finish between the two objects are distinct and do not share similarities.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the nesting dolls designed with a symmetrical structure similar to the original pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nesting dolls exhibit a symmetrical vertical design along their cylindrical form in Image B, allowing them to be opened and stored within one another. This symmetry is intrinsic to their function and design. Similarly, the pyramid in Image A showcases architectural symmetry along its central axis. Both objects share a sense of symmetry, though the axis and purpose differ significantly between them.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the nesting dolls arranged in descending size order on the wooden table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are displayed on the table, with their sizes decreasing from left to right with a slight variation in pattern. This is typical of how nesting dolls are traditionally displayed, clearly showcasing the nesting concept. The arrangement is methodical and intentional, displaying each doll in a visibly smaller size relative to its predecessor.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the largest nesting doll and possibly others incorporate a design element resembling the pyramid's central entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the largest nesting doll does not feature any apertures or designs that resemble a central entrance like the one in the pyramid shown in Image A. The dolls are smooth with painted decorations, focusing more on aesthetic beauty with floral and scenic motifs, devoid of any structural resemblance to the entrance of a pyramid.",
