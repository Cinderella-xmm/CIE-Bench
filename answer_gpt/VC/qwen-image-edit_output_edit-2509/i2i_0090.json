      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the stapler's primary color blue in both the front and rear views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the front and rear views of the stapler show a consistent blue color as the main color of the stapler. Visually, the stapler's body and top cover are blue, which is clearly evident when analyzing the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the metallic hinge appear on the stapler in both the front and rear views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the metallic hinge is visible on the left side in the rear view but not visible from the depicted angles in the front view. Therefore, the metallic hinge is not shown in both the front and rear views.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the stapling slot visible in the front view of the stapler?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the front view of the stapler in Image B, the area where staples exit the stapler is clearly visible. This indicates that the stapling slot is indeed visible in the front view.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a light blue strip visible on the top surface of the stapler in both views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B reveals that the stapler does not have a specific strip on the top surface; rather, the entire top surface is a uniform blue. Therefore, there is no distinct light blue strip visible on the top surface in either view.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a green background that appears consistent between both the front and rear views. The uniformity of the backdrop is clear, with no visible deviations or different colors, indicating that the background is uniformly green in both views.",
