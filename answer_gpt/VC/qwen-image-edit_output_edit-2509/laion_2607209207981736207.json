    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the \"Fujitsu fi-7160\" model name and logo visibly present on the top-left portion of the scanner in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scanner is presented in a holographic style which alters the visibility of specific details including text and logos. The top-left area of the scanner, where the model name and logo would typically be, is represented in a glowing holographic outline without distinct textual resolution. This implies a focus on design rather than brand identification, thus making the model name and logo not visibly present in the conventional sense.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the automatic document feeder (ADF) tray open and holding multiple documents, including a boarding pass, receipt, and payment slip, in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the scanner in a futuristic holographic display. The ADF tray is depicted with the outline of multiple documents in various positions above the scanner. While the shape and layout suggest multiple documents similar to a boarding pass, receipt, and payment slip, the details of individual documents are abstracted to fit the holographic style. Thus, even though the indication is there, the specificity is lost in translation.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the five control buttons (Menu, Stop/Clear, Scan/Enter, Power, and directional navigation) arranged in the same configuration on the right side of the scanner in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic display in Image B outlines the control panel section, and the control buttons are delineated in the same pattern as in conventional scanner designs. Thus, despite the abstraction, the configuration is visually comparable to typical button arrangements like those in office equipment, suggesting the buttons are in a similar configuration. Analysis reveals no intentional rearrangement.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the power button illuminated in green on the right-side control panel of the scanner in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the holographic interpretation abstracts physical detailing such as color. The power button is simply outlined without color indication, typical for digital renderings emphasizing technical structure over operational specifics like illumination.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the row of bristle rollers visible beneath the scanning bed of the scanner in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic display represents components in an outline or grid format without elaborate details. In this abstraction, internal features like bristle rollers beneath the scanning bed arenâ€™t visible. Focus is primarily on exterior design, not inner mechanisms.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the boarding pass, receipt, and payment slip clearly visible in the ADF tray with readable text such as \"Boarding Pass\", \"Receipt\", and \"Payment Slip\" in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic display is stylized to focus on technical outlines rather than textual clarity. While the general form of documents is suggested, legible text is not preserved. In a holographic render, detailed textual information typically gets sacrificed for image abstraction.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the scanner in the holographic display maintain the original black and light gray color scheme of the Fujitsu fi-7160?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic display presentation uses a blue glowing grid pattern, which inherently transforms the perception of color. Instead of showcasing the color scheme like black and light gray seen in typical physical models, this render abstracts color into bright manifestations, thus not retaining the original scanner's color scheme.",
