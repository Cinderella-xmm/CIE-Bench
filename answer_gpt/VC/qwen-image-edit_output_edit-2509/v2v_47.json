      "question": "Does the edited image retain the semi-circular arrangement of seating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seating is depicted in a semi-circular arrangement, which is a common feature of ancient amphitheaters. This is consistent with the design in Image A, where the seats are arranged in a semi-circular fashion to provide optimal viewing angles for spectators. Thus, the edited image indeed retains this specific architectural arrangement.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the tiered wall with arches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall structure with rows of arches is clearly represented. These arches and tiering mimic the multi-level arch design found in Roman amphitheaters. Comparing with Image A, the original structure has distinct tiers of arches which are also present in the edited version, indicating that the image has retained these characteristics.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the relationship between the seating and the stage area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a clear delineation between the semi-circular seating area and the central stage area, suggesting an intentional preservation of this relationship. In Image A, this seating and stage layout is crucial for the function of an amphitheater, designed to focus attention on the central performance space. Thus, Image B maintains this architectural feature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the even spacing of the arches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arches in Image B are evenly spaced, mimicking the style typical of ancient Roman architecture where symmetry and balance were important. A similar pattern of evenly spaced arches is seen in Image A, ensuring structural integrity and aesthetic appeal. Hence, the edited image retains this spacing feature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the overall shape and outline of the amphitheater?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays an overall shape and outline that is consistent with that of a typical amphitheater, characterized by the semi-circular seating and tiered arches. This is similar to the structure shown in Image A. The visualization of both the internal seating arrangement and external architecture ensures the edited image retains the fundamental shape and silhouette of the original amphitheater.",
