      "question": "Does the bag character retain its earthy tones and brown leather straps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bag in the comic retains an earthy tone that resembles the original color seen in Image A. The bag is depicted with brown leather straps, consistent with the tones observed in the original image. This indicates the illustrator aimed to preserve the natural color scheme of the bag despite the panel being in a more stylized, cartoon format.",

      "question": "Is the bag character's structural design, including visible stitching, preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B's comic illustration, the bag retains its recognizable structure as a duffle bag from Image A, including the depiction of handles and side attachments. However, due to the stylized, simplistic nature of the comic drawing, specific details like visible stitching may not be explicitly outlined, but the bag's overall structure suggests familiarity with the original.",

      "question": "Does the bowl character retain its white color and original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the bowl as maintaining its white color, aligning with Image A's depiction. The shape is also similar, appearing round and maintaining the fundamental bowl structure. The comic's style captures the essence of the bowl's appearance in a simplified format.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both panels of Image B display a cartoon-style wooden floor that serves as the ground setting for the scene, similar in appearance to the wooden floor in Image A. The color and striping of the floor in the comic suggest an attempt to mirror the texture and look of the real wooden floor from the original image.",

      "question": "In both panels, is the bag character positioned near the bowl character, similar to their original placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the first panel shows the bag character directly beside the bowl, akin to their side-by-side arrangement in Image A. The proximity between the two objects maintains the spatial orientation seen in the original photograph, reflecting a deliberate choice to preserve their relative positions in this narrative depiction.",
