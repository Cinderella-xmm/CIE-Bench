      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the cartoonish and stylized rendering, the tiger visibly retains its stripe pattern, which is characteristic of tigers. This conclusion is drawn from observing the clear black stripes on the body and limbs of the tiger in the edited image.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger is depicted in an upright seated posture, just like in Image A. Both images portray the tiger in a manner that suggests it is sitting with its rear supported, a conclusion drawn from the visible body orientation and the tiger's paw placement.",
