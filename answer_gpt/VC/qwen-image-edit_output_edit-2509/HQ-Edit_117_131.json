      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel indeed stands on its hind legs, with its front paws held close together near the chest. This is a typical depiction of a standing posture in cartoon illustrations, where the creature appears ready for action or exploration. This posture enhances the anthropomorphic traits, often used in illustrative styles to convey readiness or curious expressions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel features a large bushy tail that curves gracefully upwards and outward. This characteristic is typical in cartoon representations where the tail is a prominent feature to exhibit vivacity and charm. It is further distinguished by the coloring that matches the overall whimsical design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ears of the squirrel rounded and positioned on top of the head, with a visible pink inner surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel's ears are indeed rounded and perched atop its head. The pink inner ear color, common in adorable cartoon depictions, is used to evoke a softer, more approachable appearance, enhancing the character’s playful and friendly demeanor.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the eyes large, round, dark, and located symmetrically on either side of the face, with visible pupils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the squirrel with pronounced, circular eyes, a common trait in cartoon portrayals, as they help in expressing emotions and drawing viewer empathy. The symmetry and darkness imply focus while the presence of pupils contributes to a nuanced expression, adding charm to the character's exploration-driven setting.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the head proportionally smaller than the body, with the tail approximately equal in length to the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe that the squirrel's head seems larger proportionally, emphasizing facial features for expressiveness, which diverges from the natural animal proportions. The tail, though bushy, does not present an equal length compared to the cartoon body's dimensions—a design choice to maintain aesthetic balance and allure rather than mimic reality.",
