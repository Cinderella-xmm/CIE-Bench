      "question": "Is the mango depicted with an oval shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shape of the mango is depicted using pixel art, which simplifies details. However, the mango has a rounded, somewhat oval shape as typical of pixel art, even though it's more stylized than realistic. Commonly, mangos have an oval shape, and this depiction matches that characteristic.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a small stem visible at the top of the mango?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango has what appears to be a green leafy top which may represent a stem-like feature when transformed into pixel art. The leafy appearance in pixel art is common to represent stems or leaves in a simplified manner.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the paper towel folded into a cradle-like shape beneath the mango?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white area beneath the mango, depicted with blocky pixels, suggests that it is meant to represent a paper towel with uneven, jagged edges, suggestive of a cradle-like folding shape, despite the stylized form.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there four clearly defined flaps extending from the paper towel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the pixelated nature of the image, the paper towel is less defined with unclear edges. There are block shapes around the mango, but they do not translate into four clearly defined flaps due to the abstraction level.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the mango positioned in the center of the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the mango positioned slightly off-center with respect to the visible section of the table, indicated by the space distribution of the elements within the pixel-art frame.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the table show a horizontal wood grain pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table is shown with a simplified horizontal pattern typical of a table's surface, using a few lines and shades to imply a wood grain texture in pixel format. This pattern is created to mimic wood grain direction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is a wooden chair partially visible behind the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no identifiable object that resembles a wooden chair behind the table due to the limited context beyond the immediate object taking up most of the visible frame.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is there a diagonal shadow cast by the mango onto the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pixel art style limits detail, but there seems to be dark shaded areas around the mango suggesting some form of shadow. However, these are not clear or diagonal due to the abstract nature of the art style.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
