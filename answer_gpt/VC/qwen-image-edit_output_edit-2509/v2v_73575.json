      "question": "Is the image composed of two separate panels, with one bird on the left and one on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is divided into two separate panels. The left panel features a bird made of paper with map patterns, while the right panel features a bird made of crystal-like material. Each panel clearly displays one distinct bird, emphasizing dual compositions.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the bird that was originally on the left still located in the left panel, and the bird that was originally on the right still located in the right panel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the birds are entirely different compared to those in Image A. The left panel in Image B depicts a paper-crafted bird, while the original left bird in Image A was natural. Similarly, the right panel in Image B shows a crystal-like bird, unlike the original natural bird.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the bird on the left have its head turned toward the viewer, with its beak slightly open and facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird on the left is depicted with a crafted appearance, facing forward. However, its beak is not slightly open as in Image A. The change in materials and positioning provides an artistic interpretation rather than a realistic posture.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bird on the right have its body angled such that its back is partially visible and it is facing left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird on the right is crafted from crystal-like material and distinctly faces the viewer with its head slightly turned to the right, making its back's visibility limited. Unlike the original bird in Image A, which faced left, the bird's positioning in Image B provides a more imaginative portrayal.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both birds are perched on chess queen pieces, clearly visible and ensuring their balance as if gripping the structure underneath them, similar to how birds might grip natural surfaces based on prior bird imagery knowledge.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both birds maintain a clear upright and balanced posture. Despite the artistic representation using different materials, both birds exhibit a silhouette distinct by having a head, body, and tail, keeping with general avian anatomical knowledge.",
