      "question": "Is the word \"SCARECROW\" clearly visible and legible on the label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, I observe that the word 'SCARECROW' is located on the upper part of the bottle's label and is clearly visible and legible. The letters are distinct and easy to read, as they are positioned against a plain background, assisting in legibility. Such positioning and font style for wine labels are quite standard for brand emphasis.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the year \"2017\" visible somewhere on the bottle or label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, I can see the year '2017' clearly inscribed on the label, just below the brand name 'SCARECROW'. It's a common practice for wine labels to feature the vintage year prominently, usually on the front, to inform the consumer of the wine's age.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the icon at the top of the label, now transformed into a face, retain the shape of a straw hat and rustic features consistent with a scarecrow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle has been anthropomorphized, with a face added to the front. This face has large, cartoonish eyes and an expression that fits the whimsical theme, but the icon at the top does not contain a typical scarecrow features like a straw hat or rustic elements consistent with a traditional scarecrow icon.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the label still a rectangular shape positioned centrally on the front of the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the label maintains its basic rectangular shape as one would expect for a wine bottle, positioned centrally on the front. However, with the anthropomorphic transformation, the label integrates facial features, suggesting a more creative placement indirectly, yet it visually remains centralized.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the bottle oriented vertically, standing upright?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the whimsical transformation into an animated figure, the bottle does maintain a vertical orientation, standing upright as typical for the presentation of a bottle especially in a setting where it is meant to appear engaging and lively.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the label positioned exactly in the center of the bottleâ€™s height?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the label is positioned across the central region of the bottle, although now it seems to have more adornments with the facial features. Nonetheless, its main body still corresponds to a centered placement typical for the design of such bottles.",
