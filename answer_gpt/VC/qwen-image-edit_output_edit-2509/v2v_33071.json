      "question": "Does the clock tower retain its hexagonal shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock tower shows a structure with multiple angled sides that appear consistent with a hexagonal shape. A hexagon is a six-sided polygon, and the visual cues from the tower's outline match this shape, indicating that the tower is indeed hexagonal. This conclusion is supported by the regularity and pattern of the angles around the tower.",

      "question": "Is the clock face still present with Roman numerals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face is clearly visible and contains Roman numerals, which typically range from I to XII for the hours on a clock. The numerals and the traditional clock hand layout are evident on the clock face of the tower, confirming that Roman numerals are still present.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the tower still have a balcony with balusters below the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, below the clock face, there is an evident structure resembling a balcony with small, evenly spaced vertical supports known as balusters. This architectural feature, which is a horizontal railing supported by these balusters, remains visible and unchanged below the clock face, indicating its presence.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the tower retain its pointed roof structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roof of the clock tower has snow on the surface, but there is a clear visible shape of the roof beneath the snow. The outline and silhouette suggest the roof is structured in a pointed manner, consistent with what would be a pointed or conical roof structure. These characteristics retain the impression of a pointed roof structure.",

      "question": "Does the tower retain its green and yellow color scheme, excluding the flags?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main body of the tower, including various sections and architectural features, is painted in distinct shades of green and yellow. These colors are consistent throughout the tower, suggesting that aside from the flags which have been altered to represent a winter theme, the color scheme of the tower itself remains unchanged.",
