      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boots feature vibrant, colorful patterns consistent with those seen on the skis. The swirling and geometric designs are visible on both the skis and the footwear, suggesting that the motif has been preserved. This can be deduced from the visible replication of the specific aesthetic from the skis onto the boots, including the bright colors and bold patterns.",

      "question": "** Is the wooden texture of the original hockey sticks preserved in the new footwear design?\n\n**",
      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "The new footwear in Image B does not exhibit any wooden texture. The hockey sticks in Image A clearly show a wooden texture. In Image B, the material on the footwear focuses on colorful patterns without any sign of wood grain or texture typically associated with wooden objects.",

      "question": "** Does the new footwear retain a recognizable shape or silhouette reminiscent of the original skis?\n\n**",
      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the new footwear as high-heeled boots, which significantly differ from the long and flat shape of skis. The skis have a linear, elongated silhouette which a boot does not mimic. Therefore, the footwear's shape does not retain any resemblance to the skis' silhouette.",

      "question": "** Are elements inspired by the shape or structure of the original hockey sticks incorporated into the new footwear design?\n\n**",
      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "The footwear designs in Image B do not incorporate any distinct structural elements or shapes reminiscent of the hockey sticks from Image A. The hockey sticks feature a long shaft and curved blade for playing hockey, whereas the footwear design is high-heeled with no visible transformation of the hockey stick aspects into the shoe design.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "The boots in Image B exhibit a vibrant color palette that includes orange, blue, red, and yellow, which are consistent with the colors displayed on the skis. This suggests that the bold color choices from the skis have been effectively integrated into the new footwear design.",
