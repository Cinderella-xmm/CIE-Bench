    "Question": "Q1: Is the dog's fur primarily white with distinct sandy-colored spots on the ears and face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is depicted with primarily white fur, as seen on the body and legs. However, there are noticeable sandy-colored spots visible on the legs. This suggests that the dog's fur pattern includes sandy-colored spots, although the spots on the ears and face are not visible due to edits. Common knowledge suggests that dogs can have various fur patterns, including spots. Given the visual cues in Image B, the description matches the characteristic of having white fur with sandy spots.",

    "Question": "Q2: Does the dog have a rounded head with pointed ears and a short muzzle?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, we observe that the dog's silhouette provides an impression of a rounded head with pointed ears, which appear to stand erect. These features are commonly associated with certain breed characteristics. Although the muzzle is not visible, dogs with pointed ears and a rounded head often do have shorter muzzles. Based on this reasoning, the answer would be supported by the dog’s general shape and alignment, despite the edited parts.",
