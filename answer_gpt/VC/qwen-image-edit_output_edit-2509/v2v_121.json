        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature depicted has a solid color without the translucent and shiny appearance typical of gummy materials.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature is shown on a plate that appears to have decorative flower patterns rather than scattered colorful petals as seen in Image A. Therefore, the environment has been altered in the edited version, replacing the petals with a patterned design.",
