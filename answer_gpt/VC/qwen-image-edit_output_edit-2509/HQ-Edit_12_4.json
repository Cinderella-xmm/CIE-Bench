      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch face is clearly visible with Roman numerals. Utilizing common sense knowledge about Roman numerals and clock design, it appears marked from I to XII.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the watch face maintains a consistent shape that aligns with a perfect circle. A circle's defining characteristic is an even, rounded perimeter, which is evident here. This is corroborated by common knowledge of traditional pocket watches, which are typically circular in design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, within the larger circular watch face, there exists a smaller, secondary dial positioned near the bottom, reminiscent of subdials often used for measuring additional time intervals. Located traditionally in watch design below the main center as a signature of subdial placement, this supports the 6 o’clock position observation.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of the watch in Image B, a distinct knurled winding crown is observable, complete with a loop that typically serves a functional and stylistic role. Knowledge of pocket watch designs confirms that these features are used for securing the watch and adjusting the time, validating the observation.",
