    "Question": "Q1: Is the golden spherical knocker still present and positioned at the center of the lower half of the door?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the area of the door where the knocker is usually positioned is covered by the figure with wings and runic patterns. The figure occupies the central area, making it impossible to see if the knocker is still present. Therefore, based on the observable content in Image B, the knocker is not visible.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the intricate geometric carvings visible on both door panels, especially in the upper and lower sections?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the door is predominantly covered by the figure with wings, obscuring most of the intricate geometric carvings that would normally be visible. While some carvings might be partially visible around the edges, the central area, especially where most detailed carvings would be, is not visible. Hence, the carvings are not visible in the usual sense.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the horizontal rows of black metal studs evenly spaced and aligned across both door panels?",

As a result, the horizontal rows of black metal studs, if any are present on the covered sections, are not visible or identifiable. The wings and the figure cover potentially studded areas, leaving no visible confirmation of their alignment across both panels.",
