      "explanation": "In Image B, the board game boxes are clearly visible and prominent in the background.

      "question": "Do the Russian nesting dolls representing the two individuals still convey an interaction, such as one doll appearing to show something to the other?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Russian nesting dolls are aligned in a row rather than positioned to convey direct interaction.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show a wooden surface on which the Russian nesting dolls are placed. The polished texture and consistent grain pattern suggest it is a table, which fits the description of the observed item in the context of its purpose.",
