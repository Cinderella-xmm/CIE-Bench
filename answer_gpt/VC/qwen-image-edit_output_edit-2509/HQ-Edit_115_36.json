      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat displays a rich, orange fur which is the dominant coloration. Its chest, chin, and muzzle feature white fur markings that stand out against the orange, making these areas visually distinct. Based on my world knowledge regarding cat fur patterns and the typical appearance of certain cat breeds, these markings are commonly found and depicted in images of cats. The visual observation of these fur color distinctions in Image B confirms the description in the question.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is depicted in a posture that appears upright, with its body positioned vertically and its legs underneath. Its head is tilted upward slightly, giving the impression of gazing toward the window, which visually aligns with the direction of the sky outside. From world knowledge, cats often exhibit curiosity by observing stimuli outside windows, and their sitting posture can suggest attentiveness. Image B clearly depicts this action through the cat’s body language and gaze direction.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's tail appears voluminous and fluffy, indicative of thick fur. Its position is wrapped around the body, signifying a relaxed posture often associated with comfort and contentment.
