      "question": "Is the clock face circular and positioned in the center of the wooden frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a clock with a circular face, which is a common design for clocks due to its practicality in displaying time through rotating hands. The frame is ornate and symmetrical, and the round clock face is centrally positioned within this frame. The center placement is typical for maximizing visibility and aesthetic balance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the Roman numerals arranged in clockwise order from I to XII around the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face has Roman numerals displayed around it. Common sense dictates that the traditional clock design arranges these numerals in order, starting from 'I' at the top and moving in a clockwise direction until 'XII'. This standard arrangement is widely understood for readability and functionality in time-telling.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the pendulum hang directly below the clock face, supported by two vertical rods?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a clock with a pendulum, which is visible hanging below the circular clock face. This pendulum is supported by single chain link, a common feature in pendulum clocks designed for balance and rhythm of motion. The design in Image B, however, uses a singular chain instead of two rods, likely for stylistic purposes with a focus on aesthetic rather than exact traditional design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there two fluted columns, one on each side of the clock face, extending from the top to the bottom of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The frame in Image B does not include fluted columns on either side of the clock face. Columns would typically be vertical and extend along the sides, however, the frame design appears to be solid and ornate without distinct vertical fluting. The edges show ornate carvings but not the structural feature of columns as described.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a decorative crest with leaf-like carvings located at the top center of the clock frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a crest-like element at the top center of the clock, which integrates an intricate design resembling traditional crown or crest motifs, often including leaf or swirl patterns for elegance. This ornamental design is typical in classical and vintage clock styles.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a circular medallion located at the center of the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination of Image B, the center of the clock does not feature any additional medallion; it focuses on the simplicity of the clock face highlighting its hands and numeral illustration. The central design is focally clear without added center medallion element.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there two small rounded feet extending downward from the bottom corners of the clock frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clockâ€™s bottom corners do not have rounded feet extending downwards. Instead, the clock design showcases a structural and ornate element without any indication of protruding feet. Such design elements can often be found in mantel clocks but do not appear in this wall-mounted style.",
