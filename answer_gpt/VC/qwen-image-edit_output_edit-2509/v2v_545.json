      "question": "Does the sparrow retain its distinct brown, white, and black feather patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the sparrow displays a visually distinct pattern of feathers that includes a combination of brown, white, and black colors. This is a common feather pattern for sparrows, which generally possess these colors for their plumage. To determine consistency, we check the same region in Image A, and observe that the sparrow maintains the same combination of colors and pattern. Therefore, the color consistency of the feathers in both images is evident.",

      "question": "Is the sparrow's beak shape and size consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the edited image (Image B), the sparrow's beak appears short, straight, and well-proportioned to its head. Sparrows typically have small, conical beaks suited for seed-eating. When comparing with Image A, the beak shape and size are consistent, displaying no noticeable difference in form or length.",

      "question": "Is the sparrow still perched on the top rail of the chair in the same upright posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the sparrow perched, body erect, and balanced over the top rail of the chair. This posture indicates alertness, which is usual for small birds. Cross-referencing this with Image A, the sparrow's position is identical in terms of posture and perch location, indicating no change.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the chair retain its simple design with vertical slats and horizontal rails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the chair retains a straightforward design characterized by vertical slats between horizontal rails. This simple and functional design is common for typical household chairs. Checking against Image A, the chair's design elements, such as the vertical slats and horizontal rails, are preserved, thus remaining unchanged.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sparrow's feet visibly gripping the chair's top rail as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow's feet are clasping the chair's top rail, visibly gripping it for stability, which is typical of birds when perched. Confirming by examining Image A, the positioning of the feet and grip on the rail is identical, showing no modification in grip or foot position.",
