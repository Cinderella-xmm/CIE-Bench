      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the woman’s eyes clearly visible with almond-shaped pupils and defined eyeliner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face is blurred and indistinct, obscuring the features of the eyes. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the shape of the pupils or any eyeliner details. Based on this visual cue, it's evident that the eyes are not clearly visible, let alone almond-shaped with eyeliner.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the earrings consist of long, golden tassels hanging from the earlobes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the earrings is not clear due to the illustrative and abstract nature of the artwork, but from the image constraints, it suggests an agreement in color and style from Image A, where they appear as elongated tassel designs. Thus, it's reasonable to deduce they might represent long, golden tassels.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a high-standing mandarin collar with blue trim around the neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clothing illustration does show a collar design that is consistent with a mandarin collar, colored in blue, that is typically characteristic of traditional qipao styling. This aligns with common traits of a qipao, so it is logical to confirm this feature.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there blue frog closures running vertically down the center front of the qipao?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible presence of frog closures along the front of the qipao due to its illustrative style. The artwork lacks specific details matching this description across the images provided.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the hair styled in an updo with two loose strands falling on either side of the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a stylized portrayal based on Image A’s hairstyle. The hair is styled in an updo; however, there are no discernible loose strands near the face due to the artistic rendering making it look sleek and without strands. With this in mind, it doesn't clearly signify the presence of loose strands.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the main fabric of the qipao red in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are illustrated variants of the qipao with different colors. The outfit in one section is indeed red, confirming that at least one depiction shares this color feature, with others varying, like blue and green. Therefore, it's safe to affirm one red version exists.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the woman’s right hand positioned near her chest, fingers slightly curled?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not specifically show hands as the artwork emphasizes the upper-body qipao styling, focusing more on the clothing and not depicting hand positioning as seen in Image A that aligns with this description.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there embroidered floral patterns visible on the chest and upper sleeves of the qipao?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a stylized qipao with pronounced floral patterns appearing primarily at the chest and shoulder area. These patterns are consistent with traditional embroidered designs as seen on detailed qipao, confirming their visual presence.",
