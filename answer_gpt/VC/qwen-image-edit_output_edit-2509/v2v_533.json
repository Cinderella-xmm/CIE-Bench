      "question": "Does the guitar retain its teal color and circular sound hole?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar is prominently featured at the forefront, clearly displaying its body. Observing the color, it retains the teal shade similar to the original. The circular sound hole, which is a common feature in many acoustic guitars, remains visible. This information from Image B confirms that the guitar's color and sound hole shape have not changed, aligning with common characteristics of such guitars.",

      "question": "Are there still six tuning pegs on the guitar's headstock?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "The guitar headstock in Image B is visible, allowing us to count the tuning pegs easily. There are six tuning pegs, consistent with most standard guitars which typically have six strings, thus requiring six pegs. The presence of six tuning pegs suggests no modification from the standard setup.",

      "question": "Is the microphone still positioned near the guitar?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the microphone is positioned next to the guitar, much like a standard setup for a performance where microphones are used for amplifying sound. This placement near the guitar suggests it is intended to capture sound from the guitar possibly for a performance or recording. Thus, the microphone's proximity to the guitar is maintained.",

      "question": "Is the amplifier still placed behind the guitar?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the amplifier is still placed directly behind the guitar as it was in Image A. This arrangement is common to allow the amplification of sound produced by a guitar's pickups, even though this guitar looks acoustic. The amplifier's unchanged position suggests no alteration from the original setup.",

      "question": "Does the guitar maintain its original leaning posture against the amplifier?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar is shown leaning against the amplifier, just like in Image A. This leaning posture is typical for placing guitars on stage or during breaks in performances, ensuring they remain stable and easily accessible. The consistency in its leaning posture indicates that it has not been repositioned or altered.",
