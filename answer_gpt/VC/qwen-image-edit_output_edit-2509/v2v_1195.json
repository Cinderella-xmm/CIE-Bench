      "question": "Is the skateboard's distinct elongated rectangular shape with rounded ends retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard has intricate stained glass artwork overlaid on its surface, but it retains the same elongated rectangular shape with rounded ends as is common in standard skateboard designs. This characteristic is easily identifiable despite the changed design. It is clear that the skateboard's physical shape remains unchanged. Therefore, this analysis confirms the retention of the skateboard's shape.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stainless steel sink retains its oval shape and its placement on the countertop remains consistent. This is evident from the unchanged fixtures and positioning in relation to the surrounding elements like the faucet. This observation confirms the retention of both shape and placement.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden cabinets have been transformed with vibrant stained glass designs, yet the arrangement and style of the silver handles remain consistent with common cabinet design. While the visual element has been modified, the spatial arrangement and the handles are identical, indicating retention of these elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard, although visually enhanced, continues to lean against the cabinet in the same angular position. This can be verified by observing the placement of the skateboard's wheels and the unchanged contact point with the cabinet, indicating that its position remains consistent despite aesthetic changes.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns on the wall have been replaced with stained glass designs, and the floor tiles exhibit colorful reflections from the stained glass, signifying an alteration from the original beige and white tiled design. Thus, these patterns are not retained.",
