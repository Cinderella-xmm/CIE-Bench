        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Are the apples shown with a smooth, shiny texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the apples with a shiny surface which indicates smoothness, as evidenced by the reflective quality where light creates highlights and shadows on the apples. This kind of texture is typical for polished or freshly cleaned apples.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the incidence of light is clearly creating reflections and highlights on the apple surfaces, suggesting a natural light source, likely sunlight. This is evidenced by the gradation in brightness on different parts of the apples, indicating realistic interactions with the light source.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a softly blurred background, providing a bokeh effect that includes the presence of greenish shapes, likely leaves or plants. This typical use of depth-of-field in photography helps accentuate the foreground subject (the apples) while providing a natural and calming backdrop.",
