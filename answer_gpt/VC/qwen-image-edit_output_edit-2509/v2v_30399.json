      "question": "Are the brown and white mesh patterns visible on the giraffes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffes exhibit the typical brown and white mesh patterns consistent with natural giraffe skin. These patterns are clearly visible on their necks and bodies, which are characteristic markings of giraffes. This observation aligns with the common knowledge of giraffe appearance in natural habitats.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each giraffe shows the presence of ossicones on their heads, which are small horn-like structures typical of giraffes. These features are visually distinct and correctly positioned, consistent with the unique anatomy of giraffes as known in zoology.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffes are standing on a grassy field with trees in the background, appearing to be at a zoo or a safari-like environment. Despite the cartoonish elements added to their faces, the positioning of their bodies, feet, and legs appears natural and balanced, in accordance with real-life observations of giraffes standing in similar environments.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features a combination of grass, trees, and rocks, which are common elements in a natural or zoo-like habitat for giraffes. These components are consistent with typical wildlife scenery, providing a believable setting for the animals.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although there is an artistic modification to the giraffes' faces, the general body structure, including their legs and torso, remains intact. The four-legged stance and body proportions are consistent with a natural giraffe's anatomy, excluding the facial changes.",
