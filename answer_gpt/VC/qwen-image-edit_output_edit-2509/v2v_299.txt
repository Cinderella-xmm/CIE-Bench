    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the airplane's wings, engines, and tail?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the airplane has been transformed into a cartoonish, anthropomorphic depiction with visible wings, engines, and tail. The airplane has a playful design, featuring a face on its front and decorations such as a dragon pattern. Despite these changes, the fundamental elements of an airplane—the wings, engines, and tail—are still present. This transformation is purely stylistic, turning the plane into a character without eliminating its essential components needed to identify it as an airplane.",
