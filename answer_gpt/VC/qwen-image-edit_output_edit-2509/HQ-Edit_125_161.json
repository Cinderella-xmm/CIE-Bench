      "question": "Is the herringbone-patterned wooden floor present and accurately rendered in the same layout and orientation as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the herringbone-patterned floor can be identified through the wooden tiles arranged such that the grain creates a V-shaped pattern typical of herringbone designs. Comparing with Image A, the floor pattern is consistent between the two images, confirming that the layout and orientation are preserved accurately.",

      "question": "Are the vertical and horizontal moldings of the wall paneling preserved, including the recessed rectangular panels and crown molding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the detailed moldings on the walls, including vertical and horizontal frames that create recessed rectangular panels. The crown molding at the top of these panels is also visible. By comparing this with Image A, these features remain unchanged, indicating preservation.",

      "question": "Is the oval-shaped skylight or oculus at the top of the spiral staircase still present and positioned centrally above the coil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central feature at the top of the spiral staircase, resembling an oval skylight, remains positioned above the coil of the staircase. This corresponds to the oculus visible in Image A, confirming its presence and positioning.",

      "question": "Is the graphite pencil visible in the lower-right corner of the image, angled diagonally across the drawingâ€™s border?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of a graphite pencil is noticeable in the lower-right corner, lying diagonally across the border of the drawing. This detail matches Image A, indicating the pencil's consistent placement.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a thin ruled border surrounding the drawing, with short perpendicular lines at each corner highlighting the border's structure. This matches the visual cues in Image A, confirming the border's presence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the perspective of the scene maintain convergence toward the oval skylight at the top, with all architectural lines aligning accordingly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examination of Image B shows architectural lines aligning toward the oval skylight, maintaining spatial convergence to this central point. This perspective approach is consistent with Image A, ensuring continuity of depth and alignment.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the tonal gradients on the walls and floor, particularly the darker shadows near the base and lighter areas under the skylight, preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, tonal gradients continue to illustrate depth and dimension, with darker shadows noticeable at the base and lighter tones under the skylight, creating contrast across the scene. This corresponds with the tonal treatment in Image A.",

      "question": "Are the individual wooden planks of the floor rendered with fine parallel lines to indicate texture and grain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden planks exhibit detailed rendering with parallel lines, highlighting texture and grain typical of wooden flooring. These elements are consistently depicted in Image A, verifying the textural rendering.",
