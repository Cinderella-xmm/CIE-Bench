    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the representation of a navigational tool (map)?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a colorful and abstract background with a pattern resembling roads or paths interspersed with different colors. However, it appears more artistic than functional, lacking the clear demarcations typical of a navigational tool like a map. The map's representation is more abstract, which does not provide a traditional navigational function.",
