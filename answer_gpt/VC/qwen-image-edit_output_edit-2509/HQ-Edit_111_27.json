        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B doesn't provide enough detail to specifically verify the makeup details such as a white-painted face, red lips, and dark eye makeup because the face is blurred. Therefore, an analysis cannot accurately confirm these aspects based solely on the blurred image.",
