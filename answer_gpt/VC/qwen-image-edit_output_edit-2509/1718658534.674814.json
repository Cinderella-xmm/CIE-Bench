    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the dorsal ridge composed of a series of raised, looped structures running along the back of the pig?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a pig-shaped object with a dorsal ridge featuring sharp vertical structures, resembling scales or leaves commonly seen in designs, especially in decorative art. Unlike the looped structures found in knitted or handcraft designs, which are usually softer and more rounded like visible loops of yarn, the ridge in Image B is made of a continuous material with a serrated pattern.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the tail extend from the rear of the pig and terminate in a fluffy pom-pom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tail of the pig is a small, curled structure, likely composed of the same ceramic material as the rest of the pig, which does not resemble the soft, fuzzy texture of a pom-pom typically found in textile or knitted objects like the one visible in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there four short legs attached beneath the body, two on each side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the pig with four distinct short legs visible beneath its body. This is a typical feature of pig figurines for balance and support, matching the standard design of such decorative items where legs are used to stabilize the object on flat surfaces. This design feature is present in both Image A and B.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a rounded snout extending forward from the face of the pig?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a rounded snout that extends forward from the face of the pig, a characteristic feature of both real pigs and pig figurines, often designed to mimic the anatomy of pigs regardless of style or material. This detail is evident in both images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features two small ears that rest on the top of the pig's head, angled outward and upward, consistent with typical representations of pig ears in both toy and figurine designs. This detail matches the anatomy depicted in both Image A and B.",
