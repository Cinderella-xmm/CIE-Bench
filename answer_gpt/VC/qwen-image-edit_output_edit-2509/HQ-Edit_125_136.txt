    "Question": "Q3: Is Earth visible in the reflection within the astronaut’s helmet visor, appearing above the lunar horizon?",
    "explanation": "Image B uses cartoons to convey the astronaut's dynamics and does not include realistic reflections in the helmet visor. Instead, it shows a schematic depiction of steps involving astronaut and space station dynamics without any detailed vista reflections that can be identified as Earth or the lunar horizon.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the International Space Station visible in the background with its solar panels and modular structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the schematic illustration shows a representation of a space station with solar panel-like structures in the background, which represent a generalized image of a space station.
