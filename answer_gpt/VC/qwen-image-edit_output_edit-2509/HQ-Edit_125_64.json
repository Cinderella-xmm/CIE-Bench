    {

      "question": "Is the pyramid visible in the background to the right of the Sphinx, with a clear triangular silhouette against the sunset sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a pyramid can be seen clearly in the background to the right of the Sphinx. It has a distinct triangular silhouette that stands out against the sunset sky, just like in Image A. The bright sky highlights the shape of the pyramid effectively.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the sun positioned low on the horizon, directly behind the Sphinx, emitting a bright circular glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sun is positioned low on the horizon, directly behind the Sphinx. It emits a bright circular glow which is consistent with typical sunset imagery, and the brightness enhances the visual impact of the scene. The position of the sun in Image A is similarly low and behind the Sphinx.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a dense layer of clouds below the Sphinx, appearing illuminated with orange and pink hues from the sunset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a dense layer of clouds is present below the Sphinx. These clouds are bathed in orange and pink hues, likely from the illumination of the sunset, which gives a surreal and warm ambience to the image. Image A also displays similar cloud formations and coloring underneath the Sphinx.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the Sphinx facing toward the right side of the image, with its profile visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Sphinx is facing toward the right side of the image, displaying its profile. This orientation allows the viewer to see the Sphinx's distinctive profile, a positioning that remains consistent with Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the sky show a smooth gradient from warm orange near the horizon to cooler purple and pink tones at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky shows a smooth gradient transition from warm orange near the horizon to cooler purple and pink tones toward the top. This gradient provides a rich and dramatic backdrop that is typical in sunset imagery, also observed in Image A, where the sky follows a similar gradient pattern.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible horizontal erosion lines and layered textures on the lower portion of the Sphinx’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display the typical horizontal erosion lines and layered textures on the lower portion of the Sphinx’s body due to the presence of wings and other elements added to the scene. Image A, however, shows these textural details on the Sphinx’s body more clearly.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there sand visible around the base of the Sphinx, particularly near the front paws and lower body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is not on the sand around the base of the Sphinx, as the clouds and additional imagery obscures this area. Thus, the typical sand visibility around the Sphinx's base, which might be present in Image A, is not observed in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
