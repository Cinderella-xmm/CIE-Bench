      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the spatial arrangement of the car and toothbrush is analyzed. Despite being placed within a white frame, the car is located on the left side while the toothbrush is positioned on the right, border-wise. This comparison follows the traditional spatial distribution of being opposite each other.",
