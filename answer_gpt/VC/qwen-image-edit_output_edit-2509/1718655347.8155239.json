    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a large, circular, reddish celestial body located in the upper left portion of the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the celestial body is a large, circular, reddish object with rays extending from it, suggesting it represents a moon or sun. It is positioned towards the upper left of the image. Using common knowledge about moons and suns, this closely aligns with how such celestial bodies are depicted. Thus, the description matches the presence of a large, reddish celestial body in the upper left.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a prominent mountain range with snow-covered peaks spanning the background behind the lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountains are stylized and depicted with line art, using blue and orange tones to suggest snow-covered peaks. The mountain range spans across the background, and the depiction of snow implies it is meant to be prominent, even in an artistic format. Reasoning that this description matches a snow-covered mountain range, the answer is affirmative.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a large, reflective body of water occupying the central foreground of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a textured blue area in the lower part of the image that seems to represent a body of water. The swirly pattern suggests movement or reflection, commonly used to depict water in artistic illustrations. Despite the stylization, this appears to represent a lake or river. Therefore, the answer is yes.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there clusters of red-colored trees lining both banks of the lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the trees along the river are depicted in shades of blue rather than red, indicating a deviation from the typical representation or the styling in Image A. In the embroidered format, there's no indication of red trees. Thus, the analysis concludes that red trees are not present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the surface of the lake reflect the red moon and the snow-capped mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of water does not show distinct reflections of the moon or mountains. The artistic style doesn’t reflect these elements in the way they typically appear in realistic depictions. The answer is negative as the depiction does not emphasize such reflections.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible rocks and patches of snow along the lake’s edge in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of clearly distinguished rocks or snow patches isn’t apparent along the lake's edge. The imagery primarily focuses on embroidered depictions of mountains and water. Hence, there aren’t noticeable details consistent with rocks or snow, aligning with the expectation from Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the moon positioned above the mountain range and the lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The large circular celestial body in Image B, which appears to be a moon or sun, is located at the top part of the image, prominently above the stylized mountains and the body of water. Common sense suggests this indicates it is positioned above the mountain range and the lake. Therefore, the answer is yes.",
