    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the flat-topped acacia trees visible in the background, maintaining their characteristic silhouette and spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the acacia trees are clearly visible in the background. They retain their typical flat-topped appearance and are spaced similarly across the landscape, consistent with what is seen in Image A. This indicates a maintenance of their characteristic silhouette and spacing.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the tall, golden-brown savanna grass present throughout the foreground and midground, matching the original texture and density?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the savanna grass in the foreground and midground is still present. Despite the artistic changes in the animal's design, the grass maintains its golden-brown color and texture, matching the density seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sky display a continuous gradient from warm orange near the horizon to deep red and purple at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B showcases a gradient transitioning from warm hues of orange at the horizon to deeper shades of red and purple at the top, similar to Image A. This gradient is a typical visual portrayal associated with sunset scenes.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the horizon line clearly visible and straight, dividing the sky from the savanna landscape at approximately one-third up the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horizon line appears to be straight and divides the sky and savanna landscape at about one-third the vertical length of the image. This layout is consistent with the typical visual framing seen in Image A.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighting consistent with a low-angle sunset, producing warm highlights on the upper surfaces of the elephant and grass, and casting long shadows behind the subject?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B does produce warm highlights that suggest a sunset environment. However, due to the heavy artistic edits on the elephant, the typical shadow patterns may not be easily discernible. Despite this, the lighting aligns with a sunset scene as seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the elephant positioned centrally in the frame, facing directly toward the viewer with its body aligned vertically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant remains centrally positioned, facing directly toward the viewer, with its body alignment appearing vertical. This is consistent with the composition seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there no visible water bodies, rocky outcrops, or other animals in the background beyond the acacia trees and grass?",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background strictly features acacia trees and grass, similar to Image A. There are no water bodies, rocks, or other animals introduced in the background, confirming a consistent landscape setting.",

      "question": "Do the grass blades in the foreground show individual strands with slight variation in length and direction, contributing to a natural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, despite the alterations in the elephant's design, still depicts grass blades in the foreground that show variations in length and direction, similar to Image A. These subtle variations contribute to the natural texture of the scene.",
