      "question": "Is the long, curly, voluminous white beard present and extending down the front of the chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts a person wearing a costume that includes a long, curly, and voluminous white beard. This beard is part of the attire and extends down the front of the chest, suggesting a traditional and typical style often associated with Santa Claus or similar characters.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the thin-rimmed glasses worn on the face, positioned over the eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given that the face features are blurred, there is no visible indication of thin-rimmed glasses being worn on the face. Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that there are no thin-rimmed glasses visible in the edited image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the right arm is extended outward but the palm is facing downward, not upward, and the fingers are slightly spread. This suggests a waving gesture rather than the description given in the question.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the mouth curved upward in a smile and the eyes slightly crinkled at the corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features are blurred in the edited image, making it impossible to assess specific expressions such as a smile or crinkled eyes. Therefore, these features cannot be confirmed.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the head appears to be facing straight forward rather than being turned to the left side of the frame. This suggests a direct forward orientation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the facial features including the nose, eyebrows, and cheeks clearly visible and consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features in the edited image are obscured by a blur, preventing a clear view of elements such as the nose, eyebrows, and cheeks. Therefore, it is not possible to determine their visibility or consistency with the original image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the fingers of the right hand are indeed splayed outward with natural spacing between them, which is typical of a waving gesture.",
