        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the smartphone placed on the charger is the central object on the table in the seaside café setting. Its position relative to other elements, such as the glass of water, spoon, and flower pot, confirms it is centrally positioned. These elements are arranged symmetrically, indicating deliberate placement to maintain focus on the phone.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
