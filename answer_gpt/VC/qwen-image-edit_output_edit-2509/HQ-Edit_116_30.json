      "question": "Is the large circular rose window located above the central portal and featuring intricate radial tracery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the large circular rose window is placed centrally above what would be the central portal area of the cathedral-like façade. It features intricate radial tracery that is typical for gothic-style architecture, which this façade mimics. By comparing it to the familiar gothic cathedral designs, the rose window in Image B matches the description.",

      "question": "Are there three distinct arched entrances at the base of the façade, arranged symmetrically with the central one being the largest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are three distinct arched entrances visible at the base of the façade. They appear to be symmetrically arranged, with the central entrance being noticeably larger than the two on each side, following a usual design element present in gothic architecture. This leads to the conclusion that the description matches Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two tall, slender spires positioned symmetrically at the outer edges of the central gable of the building, which align with classic architectural designs. These spires contribute to the symmetrical appearance of the structure's silhouette.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The façade in Image B is designed to be symmetrically balanced around a central vertical axis. The elements such as the rose window, the spires, and the arches are aligned and mirrored across this central line, which is a common feature in traditional gothic architecture that this model imitates.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the façade is rich with intricate carvings characteristic of gothic architecture, including detailed tracery around the window areas, pinnacles, and other sculptural details that give the impression of depth and complexity typical of gothic cathedrals.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any visible flying buttresses. The façade is contained within a box-like structure which suggests that flying buttresses, typically lateral supporting structures on cathedrals, are not featured in this depiction.",
