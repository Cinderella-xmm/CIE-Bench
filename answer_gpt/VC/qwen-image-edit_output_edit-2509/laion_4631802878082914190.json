      "question": "Does the edited image contain exactly six labeled process stages corresponding to the CRISP-DM phases?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features three labeled stages: 'Data Prodaling', 'Data Preparation', and 'Milingluda Lyuyosriny'. This is fewer than the six stages found in the typical CRISP-DM phases: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment, indicating that not all phases are present in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the six stages arranged in the correct sequential order: Business Understanding → Data Understanding → Data Preparation → Modeling → Evaluation → Deployment → back to Business Understanding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the stages involve 'Data Prodaling', 'Data Preparation', and 'Milingluda Lyuyosriny', which do not align with CRISP-DM phases and are not arranged in any specific order involving these phases. Therefore, the stages are not in the correct sequential order as required.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a bidirectional connection (e.g., two-way path or mutual interaction) between the \"Business Understanding\" and \"Data Understanding\" stages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not feature these two stages labeled as 'Business Understanding' and 'Data Understanding'. Thus, no connections between these phases can be assessed.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a bidirectional connection (e.g., two-way path or mutual interaction) between the \"Data Preparation\" and \"Modeling\" stages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image contains the 'Data Preparation' stage but does not depict the 'Modeling' stage, so a bidirectional connection between the two stages cannot be analyzed within this specific image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a central data source located at the center of the diagram, accessible to all six stages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a crystal at the center, implying it might symbolize data. However, the crystal is not connected to all stages, nor is it representative of a typical data source accessible to all stages, given that only three stages are present. Also, the stages are not clearly connected to this central point.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the diagram include a clear return path from the \"Deployment\" stage back to the \"Business Understanding\" stage, completing the cycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not contain any representation of the 'Deployment' or 'Business Understanding' stages, making it impossible to identify or analyze a return path completing the cycle.",
