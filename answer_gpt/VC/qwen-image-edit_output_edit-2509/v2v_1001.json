      "question": "Is the dinosaur depicted with its long neck extended and standing in the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dinosaur is visible with a long neck extended and positioned in the water. This conclusion is drawn from the visual observation of the dinosaur's posture and surrounding water, indicating that it maintains a similar stance to Image A, where the neck is prominently stretched out in the forest setting.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the background still show a misty forest with tall trees?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is characterized by the presence of a forest shrouded in mist with numerous tall trees. This observation indicates continuity in the portrayal of a misty forest environment, akin to the consistent representation in Image A, where the atmospheric conditions and tree formations are integral elements of the scene.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the water surface still reflective, showing the dinosaur and trees faintly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the reflective quality of the water surface is preserved, as both the dinosaur's reflection and that of the trees can be discerned faintly. This reflective aspect is a shared characteristic with Image A, where reflections are also a notable feature of the water, enhancing the natural setting's realism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the lighting still natural, with a soft haze permeating the forest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears natural, with a soft haze that envelops the forest. This is evidenced by the diffusion of light through the mist, which parallels the atmospheric conditions established in Image A. Such lighting contributes to a cohesive representation of a serene forest landscape in both images.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the dinosaur retain its textured, grayish-brown skin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon viewing Image B, it is evident that the dinosaur maintains its textured, grayish-brown skin, a detail conspicuously portrayed on its body. This skin texture and color are consistent with Image A, supporting an unchanged representation of the dinosaur's appearance across both images.",
