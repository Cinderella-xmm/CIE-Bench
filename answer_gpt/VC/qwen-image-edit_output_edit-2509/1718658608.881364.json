      "question": "Does the edited image depict exactly eight arms extending from the central head mass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, we observe a ceramic-like sculpture of an octopus characterized by its glossy, smooth surface. By counting the limbs extending from the central head mass, it's evident that there are eight distinct arms, which is a typical feature of octopi. This is consistent with our knowledge that an octopus naturally has eight arms.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a distinct, rounded central head mass from which all arms originate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the sculpture of the octopus exhibits a prominent, rounded central head from which all the arms extend. This rounded structure is typical of an octopus, where the central head, known as the mantle, is visibly distinct and the arms originate from its base.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the arms exhibit a flowing, undulating arrangement that mirrors the wave patterns of the original ocean scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the octopus' arms are arranged in a stylized manner, with a glossy appearance that suggests a less naturalistic approach compared to a real octopus in its habitat. While the arms do have some curvature, they do not precisely mimic the dynamic, fluid wave patterns of the ocean scene seen in the original image. The edited image focuses on a more artistic, rigid form.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible surface textures on the sculptures that mimic the original skin's ridges and suction cup patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining the surface of the sculpture in the edited image, it is clear that the texture is smooth and glossy, resembling a ceramic material. This contrasts with the original image, where the octopus exhibits natural textures, including ridges and details on the arms and the presence of suction cups. The sculpture lacks these intricate textures, focusing instead on a polished, smooth finish.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the sculpture maintain the same general silhouette and proportional relationship between the head and arms as the original octopus?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image presents a sculpture that retains the basic silhouette of an octopus, with a central head mass and extending arms, maintaining a similar proportional relationship to what is observed in natural octopus anatomy. The scale and proportion between the head and arms are consistent with the appearance of a real octopus, albeit rendered in an abstract, glossy style.",
