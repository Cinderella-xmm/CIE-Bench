    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the dress clearly divided into a red upper section and a dark blue lower section, forming a visible gradient?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress has a distinctly visible division, with the upper part colored in red and the lower section in a dark blue. There is no gradual blending of colors forming a gradient; instead, the colors transition sharply from red to blue, indicating a clear separation between the top and bottom sections.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dress appear to be in motion, with the fabric fanning outward and upward as if caught in a twirl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dress in Image B appears to be swirling around the woman, with the fabric extending outward and upward, as typically seen in clothing when a person is twirling. The position of the fabric and its flow suggests motion, which is consistent with the depiction of the scene.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the woman’s right arm extended forward and her left arm raised, with her left hand lifting the edge of the dress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s right arm is reaching forward while her left arm is elevated slightly. Her left hand appears to be holding the edge of the dress, lifting it slightly and contributing to the swirling effect of the fabric.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the woman have long, wavy, golden-brown hair flowing behind her?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the woman with long, wavy hair that has a golden-brown hue, flowing elegantly behind her head as if moved by the wind. The coloring and styling of the hair are consistent with features that suggest motion and liveliness.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there dense clusters of pink flowers on the left side and yellow spherical flowers on the right side of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, dense clusters of pink flowers dominate both sides of the scene, while yellow spherical flowers are primarily visible towards the bottom center, not exclusively on the right. Thus, the arrangement differs from the description provided.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a bright, warm light source coming from the top right, illuminating the woman and casting a golden glow on the right side of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a bright and warm light source is coming from the upper right corner, illuminating the woman and casting a warm, golden glow across the scene. This lighting effect highlights the vibrant colors and provides depth to the overall composition.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the woman have closed eyes, a gentle smile, and a visible silver hoop earring on her left ear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face of the woman is not discernible due to the blur applied, which makes it impossible to determine features like closed eyes, a smile, or any earrings. Thus, these details cannot be confirmed from the visual cues present.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
