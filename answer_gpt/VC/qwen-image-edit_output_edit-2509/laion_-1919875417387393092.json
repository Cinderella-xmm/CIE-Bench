      "question": "Is the three-tiered wooden table structure with horizontal slats and vertical supports still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a wooden table structure visible consisting of multiple tiers, slats, and supports. The structure is more elaborate due to additional decorative elements, but the basic structure remains. Image A, before any changes, already shows the table structure. Given these observations, the structure's fundamental design is retained.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two vases on the upper tier: one with a pinched neck and one that is symmetrical. These vases are consistent with Image A, where both vase styles are also present despite their color changing from gray to turquoise. Therefore, these vases continue to be present.",

      "question_id": "Q3",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, behind the vases on the upper tier, there is a piece resembling the circular clay piece seen in Image A. While the color has changed from gray to turquoise, the recognizability and position remain unchanged.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, decorative changes and the introduction of a glass dome with greenery replace the white fabric scraps seen in Image Aâ€”where these scraps were draped conspicuously over the table edge and partially underneath the table structure. They are no longer visible in Image B.",
