      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the lime green body of the saree adorned with small golden diamond-shaped butis evenly distributed across the fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a statue dressed in a saree. Statues are monochromatic and do not display color, but the saree texture includes diamond-shaped embellishments resembling small butis evenly distributed across the fabric.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the pallu feature a blue and gold striped pattern with repeating elephant motifs in gold zari?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue's saree does not exhibit the distinct blue and gold striped pattern with elephant motifs because statues typically maintain a consistent color. Therefore, these features are not discernible or highlighted.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the blouse royal blue with golden embroidered detailing along the neckline and sleeve edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For the statue in Image B, color details such as royal blue and gold embroidery cannot be perceived. The statue maintains the monochromatic appearance typical of marble or similar materials, lacking any distinct colored blouse details.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a necklace with red and green stones positioned around the neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the statue adorned with a necklace, but due to the monochrome nature of the material, it is not possible to detect specific colors such as red or green stones. Necklaces in statues are typically carved into the structure, showing only the form without color details.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there earrings matching the necklace visible in both ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a statue in which earrings can be sculpted alongside the necklace. The style suggests continuity with the necklace, but no color differentiation or matching can be detected due to the statue's uniform material.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a golden bangle present on the right wrist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For the marble statue in Image B, any apparent bangle would be part of the singular material color, and thus would not appear golden. The statue might have such forms on the wrist, but the color detail is absent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a bindi visible on the center of the forehead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the statue presented in Image B, details such as a bindi on the forehead are less likely to be separately highlighted unless specifically sculpted. The monochromatic design does not explicitly show these smaller elements.",
