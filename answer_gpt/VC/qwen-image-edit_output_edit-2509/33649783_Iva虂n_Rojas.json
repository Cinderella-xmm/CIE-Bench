      "question": "Is the owl perched on a moss-covered branch with visible green moss texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an owl sitting on a branch that appears to be covered with dark textures, potentially resembling moss. However, the branch is primarily adorned with intricate décor that simulates the appearance of nature through the use of glowing materials and ornamental designs, rather than typical green moss texture. Thus, the visual cues suggest a stylized representation with less emphasis on conventional moss physicality.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a small green plant with slender leaves growing next to the owl’s left side on the branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, next to the owl, the area merges into decorative elements instead of natural plants with slender leaves. The depiction is oriented towards a fantastical design, lacking the presence of distinct plants typically seen in natural settings.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background composed of dark, out-of-focus green foliage typical of a forest environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background that is dark and potentially out-of-focus, maintaining a muted and blended appearance with the environment. The background shares some characteristics of a forest-like setting due to the subdued colors and indistinct definition, aligning with a standard forest environment.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the owl facing directly toward the camera with a slight head tilt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl is depicted facing the viewer directly. Its posture, including the positioning of the head, entails a framed proximity to direct angle viewing. There is no visible head tilt; the owl's head seems centered with both eyes equally oriented forward.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the branch have a rough, textured surface covered in green moss with visible patches and crevices?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The branch in Image B appears covered with fantastical ornate patterns and smooth elements rather than having a rough texture with moss, patches, and crevices. The artistic choice emphasizes visual embellishments rather than purely natural features, implying an absence of typical moss texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the lighting dim and natural, with subtle highlights on the owl’s feathers and eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts lighting that is part of a luminescent enhancement due to mystical features like glowing symbols and eyes, diverging from subtle highlights typically seen in natural environments. The image embraces pronounced rather than dim natural lighting.",
