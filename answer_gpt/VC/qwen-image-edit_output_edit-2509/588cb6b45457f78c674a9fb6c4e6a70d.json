    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes positioned symmetrically within the face, with a slight upward slant at the outer edges and gazing directly forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine if the eyes are positioned symmetrically with a slight upward slant, we would look for even placement and subtle angling at the outer edges, contributing to a forward gaze. These characteristics would indicate symmetry and alignment within the facial structure.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the nose have a straight bridge and a slightly rounded tip, aligned centrally between the eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing if the nose has a straight bridge involves looking for a linear structure running down the face's centerline and a rounded tip. Center alignment would be consistent with a straight bridge and central facial features.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the lips thin, closed, and slightly upturned at the corners, forming a neutral yet thoughtful expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining if the lips are thin, closed, and slightly upturned involves observing lip thickness, closure, and the mouth's corners for subtle upward curves that convey expression.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the face proportionally balanced, with equal spacing between the eyes and symmetrical distribution of facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Proportional balance can be assessed by measuring equal spacing and symmetry in facial features, ensuring all elements are evenly distributed.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the left ear partially visible, emerging from under the hair near the temple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visibility of the left ear would be identified by the ear's partial appearance near the temple, slightly obscured by hair.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there soft shadows along the right side of the face and under the jawline, created by directional lighting from the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Soft shadows would appear along the face and jawline's right side if the lighting comes from the left, creating depth and shape through contrast.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the head centered above the shoulders, with no unnatural tilt or rotation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A centered head would align vertically with the shoulders, exhibiting neither noticeable tilt nor rotation, indicating a natural posture.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
