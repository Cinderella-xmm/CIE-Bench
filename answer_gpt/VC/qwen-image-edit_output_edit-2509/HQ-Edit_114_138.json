      "question": "Is the woman’s hair styled in a neat silver bun on top of her head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman has her hair styled in a bun, with the color appearing to be silver, which is common for older individuals. The bun is positioned neatly on top of her head, suggesting careful grooming. This perception is drawn from the typical neat appearance associated with buns.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict any spectacles around the woman's eyes. This absence is noted from the focal point where spectacles would typically be visible, near the eyes.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the face and ears are blurred, based on the visible details and styling in Image B, there are no indications of pearl earrings in her ears. Generally, earrings might cause slight protrusions or reflections that are not observed here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the woman wearing a light beige qipao with pink and green floral embroidery and black frog closures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is depicted wearing a garment resembling a qipao which is beige with floral embroidery. The closures are visually similar to traditional frog closures, which are typically black for contrast against lighter fabric tones.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The book in Image B differs from Image A as it is depicted as an imaginative pop-up book displaying scenes, without specifically noting the material or age in its appearance. The exaggerated and stylized depiction does not lend itself to identifying traditional materials like leather or visible page aging.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface features tags with illustrations of teacups, but no physical blue-and-white porcelain teacup is seen with yellow liquid in it. This implies a creative representation of tea culture without a literal item.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show a physical teacup or saucer. Instead, there are illustrative tags on the surface without real objects resting upon them, indicating an absence of traditional teacup and saucer combinations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table is depicted with intricate and stylized designs, often digitalizing or artistically altering real fabric textures into illustrations. This markedly differs from an actual piece of patterned fabric.",
