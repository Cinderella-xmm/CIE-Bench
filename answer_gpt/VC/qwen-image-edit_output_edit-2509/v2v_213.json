      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly has black spots and white markings visible on its wings, similar to the pattern that is typically found on butterflies. These patterns are simplified and blocky, consistent with the edited style, but still recognizable in terms of location and color scheme, matching the expected arrangement seen in a butterfly's wing. Therefore, the edited image does retain the specific black spots and white markings on the butterfly's wings.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the fuzzy texture of the butterfly's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly appears to be constructed in a blocky, pixelated style reminiscent of digital or game-like graphics, which does not lend itself well to depicting natural textures such as fuzziness. The body is represented as smooth and geometric without the natural fuzzy texture that might be expected. Hence, the edited image does not retain the fuzzy texture of the butterfly's body.",

      "question": "Is the butterfly still positioned on the wooden surface in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is located on a wooden surface similar to the background seen in Image A. The edited style retains the positioning and setting of the original image, showcasing the butterfly on the table-like surface. The presence of the wooden texture and the similar composition in both images leads to the conclusion that the butterfly is still positioned on the wooden surface.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pixelated and blocky design in Image B simplifies the texture and detail found in the wings of a butterfly. While the shape and pattern are retained, the intricate and detailed texture typical of a real butterfly's wings is not present. This abstract style contrasts with the natural, detailed depiction found in Image A, indicating that the edited image does not retain the detailed texture of the butterfly's wings.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the specific arrangement of spots on the butterfly's wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the style is blockier and pixelated, the specific arrangement and relative positioning of spots on the butterflyâ€™s wings are preserved, maintaining a recognizable pattern. By comparing to the original arrangement from Image A, it can be seen that the edited image retains the specific arrangement of spots, even with a simplified style.",
