      "question": "Is the \"POLICE\" and \"CME\" text present on the driver’s side door in the same position and font style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the police car is constructed with LEGO bricks, and does not feature any text like 'POLICE' or 'CME' on the driver's side door. Common LEGO brick models often don't include detailed text due to the constraints of brick shapes, making it visually distinct from conventional markings on real cars.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the gold-colored badge emblem with a shield and star design located on the driver’s side door?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, since the police car is made from LEGO bricks, there is no recognition of complex emblem designs such as badges with shields or stars. Displaying such intricate details is uncommon in LEGO models, which tend to have simpler, block-based designs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the rooftop light bar have the exact red-blue-red-blue color sequence from left to right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO police car's rooftop light bar is constructed with bricks that clearly depict the color sequence as red-blue-red-blue from left to right. This fits a typical pattern for police vehicles but with LEGO's simplicity.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the front grille composed of horizontal slats with a central chrome bar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B of the LEGO model shows the front grille made of blocky designs typical for LEGO. It does not show horizontal slats or central chrome bars due to LEGO's limitations in representing such complex and fine-grained details.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the license plate displaying \"LIP\" above \"CHICAGO POLICE\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, examining the LEGO construct reveals that no license plate design is visible, including any specific text like 'LIP' or 'CHICAGO POLICE.' LEGO models seldom have such detailed and specific inscriptions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a LEGO model of a police car that maintains the recognizable shape and silhouette of a four-door sedan with a long hood and trunk. This silhouette often aims to resemble real cars even in simplified block forms.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the rectangular headlights and amber turn signals positioned symmetrically on the front fenders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO police car with headlights presented as block-shaped, positioned symmetrically on the front, which simulates the typical headlight setup in real cars; however, they tend to be square rather than strictly rectangular. However, the amber turn signals are not distinctly visible.",
