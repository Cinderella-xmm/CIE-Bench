      "question": "Are the cheetahs still depicted in their original seated and standing postures on the earthen mound?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetahs retain their postures similar to Image A, with one cheetah seated and the other standing behind. Despite the transformation into a steampunk theme, their relative seated and standing positions on the mound are maintained. By observing their body alignment and positioning in Image B, these aspects remain unchanged from Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the image shows a similar earth-colored mound beneath the cheetahs, just as in Image A. The mound might have undergone slight texture enhancement due to the edited style, but its presence and appearance are consistent.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the characteristic black-ringed tails of the cheetahs, visible behind the cheetah in a seated position. Despite the steampunk alterations to their bodies, this distinctive feature of cheetahs remains identifiable and distinct, as in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the savanna landscape has been heavily transformed into a steampunk environment with mechanical towers and a golden hued setting, replacing the natural savanna with a fantastical backdrop. The original greenery and horizon seen in Image A are significantly altered, adopting a steampunk aesthetic instead.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The relative positioning of cheetahs with one sitting in front and the other standing behind is preserved in Image B. The alterations respect the positioning dynamics from Image A, despite the steampunk-themed transformation applied to their physical appearances.",
