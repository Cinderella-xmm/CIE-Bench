      "question": "Are the three triangular windows positioned at the apex of the A-frame roof clearly present and maintaining their triangular shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure now looks like it is made of translucent blue and green materials, resembling a crystal-like composition. Despite this transformation, the triangular shapes at the apex of the roof are visible, suggesting the outline of the previously wooden structure is still intact. The maintenance of triangular shapes in the roof apex area can be deduced, therefore, they are still present and clearly maintain their form. This recognition relies on visual analysis of the geometric shapes made evident through the new material depiction.",

      "question": "Is the cabin structured with a raised deck on the upper level and a garage on the lower level, maintaining the same vertical separation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cabin with a prominent structure on the upper half, indicating the presence of a deck. The lower section shows an area that would traditionally correspond to a garage. The clear division and separated zones are visually consistent with the idea of a deck above and garage below, as indicated by the area's dimensional layout. Hence, the vertical separation seen reflects the unchanged structural division common in cabins with raised decks.",

      "question": "Is the garage door located on the right side of the lower level, adjacent to the main entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, within the transformed crystalline structure, there is an area in the lower section which resembles what can be recognized as a typical garage due to its proportions and placement. The main entrance, more central, is on this lower level as well. This layout is similar to traditional placements, so visual cues indicate that the garage door's position remains as previously located, to the right side.",

      "question": "Is the cabin symmetric about its central vertical axis, with the roof peak, main entrance, and supporting columns aligned centrally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the structure appears to maintain symmetry along its central vertical axis. The peak of the roof and the crystalline design suggest that the roof, entrance, and support columns are aligned in a symmetrical fashion. This is typical for such designs to maintain balance and aesthetic harmony, thus reinforcing the image symmetry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the vertical support columns beneath the deck present and positioned at regular intervals along the front facade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vertical support columns are visualized within the crystalline structure's transparency, appearing consistently spaced along the front facade as is common in deck builds. These regular columns help in sustaining the balance and support of the upper structure. The discernible alignment and intervals indicate their ongoing positional logic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the small rectangular window located on the lower level, to the left of the main entrance, still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, with its crystalline design, includes a small, defined section corresponding to where windows usually reside. To the left of what is interpreted as the main entrance, positioned within the crystalline structure, is where this window space can be seen. This indicates that the window, though styled differently due to the new material, exists in that traditional location.",

      "question": "Is the stone retaining wall made of large, irregular boulders visible on the right side of the cabin's base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any obvious signs of a stone retaining wall composed of large boulders on the right side of the cabin's base. Instead, such typical details appear absent or are obscured by the new crystalline aesthetic, which primarily dominates the scene. Thus, the previous characteristic is not prominent in this context.",
