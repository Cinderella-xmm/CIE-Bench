        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color palette is dominated by warm tones, primarily seen in the reddish-brown background gradient and the colors of the figures inside the display case. Although the gold color specifically is not as prominently featured, the overall warm color theme is maintained through the warm tones of the background and the display's contents.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
