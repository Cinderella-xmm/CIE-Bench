      "question": "Does the standing doll retain its ballet pose with arms extended outward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the standing figure is depicted with its arms extended outward, resembling a ballet pose. This corresponds to a typical ballet stance where arms are gracefully held outwards, often seen in poses such as a 'first position' or 'second position' in ballet terminology. Without needing to reference Image A, Image B clearly reflects this pose.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the standing figure is depicted wearing a light-colored skirt which appears to be a tutu, based on the flowing and layered appearance typical of ballet costumes. This indicates consistency with a ballet theme. Without comparing Image A, the tutu remains observable in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seated figure is illustrated wearing a pink top. The color and style suggest a casual piece of clothing consistent with the original theme. This observation is supported independently of Image A by the presence of a clear pink hue on the seated figure.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both figures are seen with blonde hair. The standing figure has intricate detailing that suggests a braid, while the seated figure has straightforward blonde hair. The hairstyles signify that the distinct blonde features from Image A are maintained, based solely on Image B's presentation.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both figures are positioned similarly, with one standing and one seated on a flat surface that mimics a display-like setting. This observation is based solely on Image B, where the configuration of the figures parallels a display scenario.",
