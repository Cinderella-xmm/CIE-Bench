      "question": "Are the four minarets positioned symmetrically—two on the left and two on the right—relative to the central dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object appears to be a fantastical structure with architectural elements similar to a central dome, but there are no minarets. Instead, it has organic and ornate extensions, resembling wings. In Image A, the Hagia Sophia is flanked by four minarets, two on each side, which are symmetrically positioned around the central dome. Therefore, Image B does not have minarets positioned symmetrically like in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the 15 July Martyrs Bridge clearly visible in the background, crossing the water behind the Hagia Sophia?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of a cosmic space-like environment with stars and nebulous patterns, not a terrestrial cityscape. Thus, no bridge is visible. In Image A, a bridge is clearly visible, crossing over a large body of water in the background. Comparatively, Image B lacks such a feature.",

      "question": "Is a large body of water visible behind the Hagia Sophia, extending toward the horizon with boats on its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, depicting a space-themed environment, shows cosmic elements instead of a body of water. In Image A, the Hagia Sophia has a water body behind it with visible boats. Image B has no such feature.",

      "question": "Are green trees visible in the foreground, partially obscuring the base of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground shows elaborate decorative elements and appendages associated with the structure, which do not include green trees. In contrast, Image A shows green trees in the foreground, slightly obscuring the base of the Hagia Sophia.",

      "question": "Are multiple arched windows visible on the front-facing wall beneath the central dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an ornate, opulent dome-like structure without traditional architectural windows. It instead has a central cosmic-themed design. Image A features several arched windows on the front-facing wall beneath the central dome. Therefore, Image B lacks these window features.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are several smaller domes visible around the base of the central dome, forming a tiered roofline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features various dome-like and ornate structures surrounding the main dome, similar to architectural designs for religious structures, resembling a tiered appearance. Similarly, Image A shows smaller domes forming a tiered roofline around the Hagia Sophia's central dome. Thus, both images have elements forming a tiered roofline appearance.",

      "question": "Is the sky uniformly clear and light blue, indicating daytime conditions without clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a cosmic-themed sky with dark blue tones and nebulae, not indicative of clear daytime conditions. In contrast, Image A shows a light blue, clear daytime sky without clouds, typical during the day. Therefore, Image B does not display the clear sky conditions found in Image A.",
