      "question": "Is the anvil present with a blocky rectangular base and a pointed horn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the anvil is depicted with a rectangular blocky base typical of traditional anvils. It features a pointed horn, which is used for shaping metal. Such a design is common for anvils, combining functionality for various blacksmithing tasks. The visual cues affirm this description.",

      "question": "Is there a glowing red-orange metal object resting on the anvil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a glowing red-orange metal object is indeed visible on the anvil, directly beneath where the hammer is positioned. The color is characteristic of heated metal, indicating it is being worked on. This visual cue suggests the process of metal forging.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer appears positioned above the glowing metal object lying on the anvil, suggesting imminent contact or active forging. This is inferred from the traditional action of striking heated metal to shape it.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blacksmith appears to be using tongs in his left hand, gripping the glowing metal on the anvil. The use of tongs is typical in metalworking for handling hot materials safely.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the anvil is clearly placed on a circular wooden stump, which is a common setup for anvils as it provides a stable, elevated working surface. The visual evidence supports this observation.",
