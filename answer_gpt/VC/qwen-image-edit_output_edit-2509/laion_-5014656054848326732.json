      "question": "Are the black-framed glasses with rectangular lenses and visible reflections on the lenses still present on the man's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area where glasses would typically be visible is covered by a blur, which means we cannot confirm the presence of specific features like black-framed glasses. Without visible indications of glasses, we conclude that they are no longer depicted. Based on this reasoning, we conclude that the glasses are not present.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the trimmed beard and mustache, particularly the defined jawline coverage and upper lip growth, still present on the man's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a blur over where facial hair features would be visible, obscuring any clear view of a beard or mustache. Since the facial hair cannot be confirmed due to the blur, we conclude it is not depicted.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the light brown, textured, swept-back hairstyle with visible volume and side-parting still present on the man's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, hair is visible and appears dark, styled in a classic swept-back manner. Texturing and volume align with the description, although the color appears different due to the sepia tone used in the entire image. The hairstyle remains, adjusted to match the vintage aesthetic. We use general understanding of the consistency in such transformations to conclude the hairstyle is still present.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both hands positioned near the writing object (book), with the right hand showing a grip-like pose and the left hand partially extended toward the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both hands are visible: the right hand holds a feather quill, and the left hand rests open on the book, showing involvement with the writing object much like described. This positioning is consistent with the described action and position of the hands in the question.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the table surface still a flat, white, matte plane with soft reflections and no visible texture or pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface in front of the man appears detailed with designs common in classic illustrations, incorporating floral patterns on a sepia-tone background. This contrasts the plain white surface described, indicating a change in texture and coloring consistent with an artistic transition.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the lighting still coming from the front-left, creating a soft highlight on the left side of the face and a subtle shadow on the right side of the neck and shoulder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, lighting conditions are less defined due to the uniform sepia shading typical for illustrative art styles. This results in unclear or less pronounced directional shadows or highlights. Since specific directional lighting isnâ€™t visible, we can assume the lighting condition has changed.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the man still seated with his torso slightly leaned forward, head tilted upward and to the right, eyes looking up and away?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man appears to sit upright, focused on the book, without visible indications of a head tilt upward and right or looking up and away. The different posture in connection to his task in this reimagined context suggests a change from the original described posture.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a large open book in front of the man. It appears integral to the scene's writing theme and design, holding a prominent, central position on the table. The artistic style implies classic leather-bound styling in alignment with the question details.",
