      "question": "Does the thermometer retain its circular shape and metallic rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object maintains a circular shape and has a metallic rim that surrounds it. This design is typical for a traditional thermometer gauge. The visual cues in the image clearly depict a round object with shiny, metallic edges, indicating it retains its original appearance from Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the temperature scale markings (-2째C to 200째C) clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the temperature scale markings are clearly printed along the perimeter of the circle, ranging from -2째C to 200째C. These numerals are strategically placed for readability, and they are distinctly visible, allowing viewers to easily interpret the temperature range.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the needle present and positioned correctly relative to the temperature scale?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a needle fixed at the center of the circular temperature scale, pointing towards the range on the scale. The needle is essential for indicating the temperature, and its position aligns accurately relative to the scale. The placement is consistent with the expected functionality of a traditional thermometer gauge.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the text \"TEMPERATURE\" still visible in the center of the thermometer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'TEMPERATURE' is prominently located near the center of the circular face of the thermometer in Image B. This placement is typical for a temperature gauge, ensuring users can quickly identify the purpose of the gauge. The text is clearly legible and maintains its central position as seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the thermometer retain a white face for clear visibility of the markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face of the thermometer in Image B is white, a color choice that maximizes contrast with the black markings and needle. This design enhances readability, making it easy to discern the numerical temperatures and needle position. The white background is a common feature in traditional thermometer gauges because it aids in clarity.",
