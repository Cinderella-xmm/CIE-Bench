      "question": "Does the image retain the vibrant lime-green color for the nesting dolls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are depicted in a vibrant lime-green color. This color is strikingly similar to the hue seen in the soccer cleat in Image A. The lime-green color is prominent and easy to distinguish, indicating that the vibrant color is retained in the nesting dolls.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls appear smooth without any texture resembling the textured surface of the soccer cleat in Image A. The cleat in Image A shows a grainy texture similar to a leather or synthetic material, while the dolls in Image B appear glossy and smooth.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nesting dolls in Image B do not exhibit any fuzzy texture or white seam characteristics associated with the tennis ball in Image A. The tennis ball has a distinct fuzzy appearance and a seam, while the nesting dolls appear smooth and with painted designs, and lack these features.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls maintain their traditional round, somewhat cylindrical shape and do not resemble the elongated, streamlined shape of the soccer cleat in Image A. The cleat has a clear elongated design intended for the foot, while the dolls retain the classic form of matryoshka dolls.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nesting dolls in Image B have a rounded, cylindrical shape, different from the perfect spherical shape of a tennis ball. Although the dolls have a round characteristic, they do not entirely match the tennis ball's singular, spherical form, as they maintain the traditional matryoshka shape.",
