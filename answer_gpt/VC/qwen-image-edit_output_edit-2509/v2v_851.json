        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the horse is clearly visible and in the process of being loaded into the trailer, indicating that the horse is indeed present and interacting with the trailer.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
