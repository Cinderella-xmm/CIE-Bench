      "question": "Is the floral/paisley pattern in red-brown tones with green trim present on the jacket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the jacket is decorated with intricate patterns that resemble floral or paisley designs. However, the dominant color scheme of the jacket appears to be a rich blue and gold without specific red-brown tones or green trim. Common sense and pattern recognition suggest that floral/paisley patterns could manifest in varied colors, but based on the visual evidence in Image B, red-brown tones with green trim are not discernible.",

      "question": "Are the symmetrical teal triangular appliqués positioned near the hem of the pale blue-gray skirt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a skirt with decorative elements close to its hem. These elements are stylized in a symmetrical, triangular pattern and are indeed teal, consistent with the description given. Such design choices are often used in clothing to add visual interest and embellishment.",

      "question": "Is a teal ribbon tied in a bow at the waist of the jacket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waist of the jacket does not feature a teal ribbon tied in a bow. The dress's style resembles historical garments where ribbons or belts might cinch the waist for a fitted appearance, but as per the Image B observation, no such teal ribbon is visible.",

      "question": "Does the jacket have flared sleeves and a wide collar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a jacket with sleeves that conform closely to the arms rather than flaring out. The collar is decorated with lace and complements the period style but does not appear exceptionally wide. Historical knowledge informs us that wide collars and flared sleeves are prominent in certain eras, such as the Victorian period, yet based on the visuals, this specific design feature is not present.",

      "question": "Do the green trim on the jacket and the teal appliqués on the skirt share a similar hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jacket does not contain green trim, while the teal appliqués are a noticeable element of the skirt. Comparison of colors and shades is a subjective process, but given the observed differences and absence of green trim on the jacket in Image B, similarities in hue are not applicable.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B reveals decorative aspects consistent with button-like elements. Buttons are typically employed for fastening purposes and aesthetic balance in garment design, but the central portion of the jacket in Image B does not distinctly show any buttons.",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the skirt exhibits vertical folds and draping that contribute to its volume and graceful movement. These features are customary in historical fashion to create a majestic silhouette and allow mobility.",
