      "question": "Is there a pink floral hair ornament with dangling tassels positioned at the top-right of the figure’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each chibi figure has visible pink floral hair ornaments on the top right of their heads, accompanied by red ribbons. These ornaments include elements that can be interpreted as dangling tassels based on their design, which is typical for traditional Japanese hair accessories. This reasoning is supported by the knowledge of traditional hair ornaments that often feature tassels.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a wide obi tied at the waist with a red-and-yellow patterned bow visible from the back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each chibi character features a wide obi wrapped around their waist, tied with an apparent bow at the back, which is yellow but not red-and-yellow patterned. While real obi consist of fabric that can include patterns, these do not show such pattern details visibly from this perspective.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the kimono have a dark blue base color with floral patterns overlaid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi characters wear kimonos primarily with a blue base and colorful floral patterns. While blue is the prominent base color in this image, it does not qualify as dark blue due to its vibrant tones. This reasoning is based on the observable color characteristics typical in illustrations.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the kimono composed of pink, red, and white blossoms resembling cherry blossoms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimonos feature floral patterns primarily in pink and other overlaid patterns, resembling cherry blossoms in their stylization. While the exact shades suggest pink, they do lack a complete variety including red and white as visible in cherry blossoms. This understanding considers the typical depiction of cherry blossoms.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the figure depicted as a woman wearing a traditional Japanese kimono?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts chibi representations of females, all wearing traditional Japanese attire resembling kimonos, which is evidenced by the design elements such as the wrap style and obi. This is validated by recognizing the clear cultural depiction typical for female characters in this attire in artistic illustrations.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are cherry blossoms present either in the kimono pattern or as props (e.g., branch, falling petals) in the figure’s immediate vicinity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figures feature cherry blossom-like floral patterns directly on their kimonos and are surrounded by elements like branches and falling petals, which visually resemble cherry blossoms. This is a typical representation for such cultural artistic interpretations.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the obi positioned at the waist and tied in a bow at the back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi characters in Image B have the obi positioned around their waists, visibly tied in a large bow at the back, which is typical in traditional kimono attire. This observation comes from the art style, emphasizing the characteristic kimono ribbon arrangement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the figure shown in a side profile, facing right, in at least one of the four poses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts multiple chibi characters in various poses. While they are not in strict side profiles, none specifically face right; instead, they face forward or left. This judgment uses character orientation which is typically accentuated in chibi design for expressive portrayal.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
