      "question": "Does the image retain the golden-brown bun with its soft texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandwich displays a bun at the top that has a golden-brown color, indicating it has been baked to achieve a certain browning. The bun also appears to have a soft texture, which is visually inferred from the slight indentations and plush appearance on its surface. This conclusion is derived from observing the bun's coloration and surface characteristics often associated with golden-brown, softly-baked goods.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the sandwich located on a white plate. The color and shape of the plate, along with it being the base for the sandwich, provide clear visual confirmation that the white plate is retained in the edited image. This matches common dining setups where sandwiches are often placed on plates.",

      "question": "Are the fresh lettuce leaves still present beneath the meat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is clearly visible fresh green lettuce beneath the meat layers. The texture and coloration suggest its freshness, typically seen in salad or sandwich vegetables. This visual analysis indicates the lettuce leaves are still part of the sandwich's composition in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays slices of meat beneath the added pineapple, and based on texture and typical sandwich ingredients, these appear to be slices of turkey breast. This identification is made by observing the smooth, pale surface typical of turkey slices used in sandwiches.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandwich is situated on what appears to be a wooden table with visible grain and color typical of wood. Additionally, there is a hand present in the background that is identifiable by its shape, providing context similar to dining environments. These visual cues confirm retention of the wooden table setup and the hand in the background.",
