      "question": "Is the golden spherical knocker still present and positioned at the center of the lower half of the door?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area of the door where the knocker is usually positioned is covered by the figure with wings and runic patterns. The figure occupies the central area, making it impossible to see if the knocker is still present. Therefore, based on the observable content in Image B, the knocker is not visible.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the intricate geometric carvings visible on both door panels, especially in the upper and lower sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the door is predominantly covered by the figure with wings, obscuring most of the intricate geometric carvings that would normally be visible. While some carvings might be partially visible around the edges, the central area, especially where most detailed carvings would be, is not visible. Hence, the carvings are not visible in the usual sense.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the horizontal rows of black metal studs evenly spaced and aligned across both door panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure obscures the majority of the door. As a result, the horizontal rows of black metal studs, if any are present on the covered sections, are not visible or identifiable. The wings and the figure cover potentially studded areas, leaving no visible confirmation of their alignment across both panels.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the surrounding wall made of textured, earth-toned adobe with visible cracks and peeling plaster?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surrounding wall is still visible. It shows characteristics of being made from textured, earth-toned adobe with visible signs of wear such as cracks and peeling plaster. This observation remains unaffected by the figure in front of the door.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a small square window with a blue mosaic tile pattern located to the right of the doorframe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the small square window that appears in Image A is visible and identifiable, still featuring a pattern that suggests a mosaic, though the exact color and detail might not be as distinct due to the perspective and lighting changes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground is visible and retains the appearance of being made of rectangular paving stones laid out in a herringbone pattern. This area is not affected by the added figure, and the ground details are clear.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the door framed by a carved wooden surround with geometric borders and a flat lintel above the arch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the presence of the figure, the doorâ€™s frame with carved wooden geometries and a flat lintel above the arch remains visible and unchanged. The added figure does not cover this portion, allowing for these details to be identified clearly.",
