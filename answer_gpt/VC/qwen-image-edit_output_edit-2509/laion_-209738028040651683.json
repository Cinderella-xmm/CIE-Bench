    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the almond-shaped eyes with visible dark eyeliner and defined lashes present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, focusing on characteristics beyond the blurred face, elements like eyes are not discernible due to the image edit obscuring facial features. Given that the face is intentionally blurred, detailed features like almond-shaped eyes or eyeliner cannot be confirmed.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the woman smiling with visible upper teeth in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image obscures the facial region preventing identification of smiles or teeth. Image modifications ensure facial features such as smiles or teeth remain hidden.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the nose with a straight bridge and rounded tip present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since the face is blurred in the edited image, specific facial features like a nose with a straight bridge and rounded tip are not identifiable.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the woman have light skin with a warm undertone in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skin on visible body parts such as arms appears light with a potential warm undertone. Given the nature of historical themes, skin tones are adapted to blend with the attire and background, but details discernible in light skin with warm undertones remain visible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the woman's body silhouette consistent with the original — upright, slender build, and proportional limbs — in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images depict a woman with an upright posture, though the costume changes affect the perceive silhouette. Despite the historical dress's full form, the woman's build remains proportionate and upright, consistent with the original build.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is a silver necklace with a small pendant visible around the woman’s neck in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, no necklace is visible. The historical attire and visible pearls around the neck suggest a different piece of jewelry, contradicting the presence of a silver necklace.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the woman’s dark brown hair visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The edited image displays styled hair in a distinct historical fashion, hidden beneath elaborate wigs typical of the period portrayed, leaving no visible dark brown hair.",
