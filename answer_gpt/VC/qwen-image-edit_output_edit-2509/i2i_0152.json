      "question": "Is the steaming cup of coffee present in the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the steaming cup of coffee is clearly visible near the center of the image. The cup's position appears central due to the framing of the composition, which draws attention to the focal point of the coffee cup on the table. Considering common perceptions of scene composition, the center of the image is typically occupied by its main subject, which in this case is the coffee cup.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a table with distinct wooden texture characterized by visible wood grain patterns and natural light reflections typically associated with wooden surfaces. The visual cues such as grain lines and warm color tones help in identifying the table as being made of wood. Without needing to refer to Image A, the wooden texture in Image B is clearly evident.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, kitchen cabinets are visible in the background, along with various kitchen utensils like pots and similar items typically found in a kitchen setting.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features natural lighting streaming in from the left side, observable by the shadows and highlights on the table and the brightness on the side of the coffee cup closest to the light source. This suggests that the ambiance of natural light coming through a window or open space on the left has been preserved, as commonly seen with directional lighting in interiors.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, steam is visibly rising from the coffee cup, indicated by the wispy, translucent lines and forms ascending above the cup. This visual cue, common for hot beverages, suggests that the coffee is steaming. Steaming signifies a state of heated liquid where steam release is evident.",
