    "Question": "Q1: Is the man still wearing a gray T-shirt and black pants while sitting cross-legged on the floor?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on the keychain held by a hand, which does not depict the previously visible man wearing a gray T-shirt and black pants while sitting cross-legged on the floor.
