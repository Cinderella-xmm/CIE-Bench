        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toilet appears in a typical bathroom setting and is predominantly white, which is a common color for toilets due to its association with cleanliness. The visual cues, such as the glossy surface of the ceramic material, confirm the consistent white coloration. Toilets are typically designed in white or light colors to enhance the perception of sanitation.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toilet lid is visibly open, which is distinguished by the vertical position of the lid as it rests against the flush tank.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a conventional toilet setup where the flush tank is integrated as part of the toilet structure positioned directly above the bowl. The attachment is standard for household toilets, and the tank rests in close proximity to the wall. The image does not show any changes in this setup.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surrounding environment features gray square tiles both on the walls and floor, which is consistent with typical bathroom decor that favors easily cleanable surfaces. The gray tiling creates a neutral and subtle background, which is often chosen for its ability to complement various bathroom fixtures.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the toilet located in a corner, evidenced by its placement at the intersection of two tiled walls. This arrangement is practical in maximizing room space and utility, a common layout for small or standard-sized bathrooms to efficiently use available space.",
