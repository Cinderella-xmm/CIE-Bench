    "Question": "Q1: Is the dancer depicted in an arabesque leap with one leg extended behind and arms forming a diagonal line?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is positioned in a leap with one leg forward and the other leg forming an 'L' shape alongside their body - this leap does not fit the arabesque stance where typically one leg extends straight behind the body, and the arms create a horizontal or diagonal line. The depicted posture suggests a jumping maneuver rather than an arabesque pose. Therefore, using common ballet knowledge and understanding leaps and positions, the dancer is not in an arabesque.",
    "answer": "No"
