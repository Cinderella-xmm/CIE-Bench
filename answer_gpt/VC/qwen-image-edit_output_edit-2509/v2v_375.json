      "question": "Is the brown horse with bridle and harness present in the same position and configuration as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the focus is on the presence and configuration of the brown horse with bridle and harness. The horse in Image A is part of a historical and traditional carriage scene typical of the era depicted, which normally includes a brown horse with specific harnessing. In Image B, this traditional setting is entirely replaced with a cartoon-like depiction centered on wedding attire figures, clearly indicating that the horse is not present in Image B.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the coachman is depicted firmly seated and holding reins, integral to the narrative of a traditional carriage journey.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
