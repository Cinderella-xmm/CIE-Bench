      "question": "Is the subject's serene expression with the subtle smile retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the blur obscuring the face, it is impossible to determine the presence or absence of a serene expression or subtle smile. In traditional art, such as the Mona Lisa, a serene expression with a subtle smile is a characteristic feature. However, without visual cues available here, it's not possible to ascertain this detail.",

      "question": "Is the subject wearing a dark garment with a gold-trimmed neckline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the subject is depicted wearing a dark garment, similar to the one in Image A. The neckline has a thin trim, which appears to be stylized with a hint of color change denoting a seam or design feature. This aligns with the expected appearance of a gold-trimmed neckline.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the subject's arms crossed in front of her at the waist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hands are positioned in front of the body, with one hand resting over the other, which resembles a crossed-arm posture seen in classical imagery. This positioning suggests a crossing or overlapping of arms at the waist, consistent with the Mona Lisa's classic pose.",

      "question": "Does the background retain the winding river and distant mountain elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a background with natural elements, such as a winding river and distant mountains, which are discernible features of the background. These elements are consistent with the landscape style featured in Image A but in an animated or stylized form.",

      "question": "Is the subject centrally positioned within the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is positioned symmetrically within the frame. This central positioning is consistent with traditional portrait compositions, especially similar to that of the original Mona Lisa, thereby indicating an intentional alignment in the frame.",
