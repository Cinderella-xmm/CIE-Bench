      "question": "Are the cabinet doors and drawers designed in a shaker style in both views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Shaker style cabinets are usually characterized by a simple, clean design with a flat panel and a frame around it. Based on the edited image (Image B), the cabinet doors and drawers appear to have this shaker style as they exhibit these defining characteristics. The top-down view also shows the cabinet croplan which typically maintains the same design style visually. Therefore, both views consistently depict shaker style design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do both the top-down and side views show two rectangular sink basins with consistent dimensions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the top-down view clearly shows the dimensions labels of 21 inches for the sink basin and a rectangular shape. Similarly, the side view indicates the same rectangular shape and dimensions through proportionality. Although specific dimensions are written, the visual consistency across both views indicates two identical rectangular basins.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the black faucets present above each sink basin in both views with the correct orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), black faucets are visible directly above each sink basin in the top-down view and are positioned in a typical orientation pointing into the sink basins. The side view corroborates this arrangement showing faucets oriented appropriately above the basins. The familiarity of faucet design informs this understanding.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the countertop depicted in both views as a light-colored marble texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) displays a countertop with a veined pattern that suggests marble texture. The top-down view represents this textured counter uniformly as a light marble texture with veining. This consistent depiction in both views reflects common marble characteristics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the compartments (drawers and cabinets) arranged in the same manner in both the top-down and side views, mirroring the original layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the top-down view illustrates a layout with drawers placed centrally between two cabinet doors. The side view aligns with this arrangement, as the perspective shows consistent placement of drawers and cabinets. Image A must be consulted here for comparison: Analysis reveals that the arrangement is identical, symmetrically mirroring the original layout albeit in different scales or perspectives, sustaining spatial coherence.",
