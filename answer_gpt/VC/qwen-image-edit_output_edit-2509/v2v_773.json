      "question": "Is there a single dark brown seed visible in the center of the apple's cross-section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apple is shown in a package, and within its cross-section, a single darker brown seed is present and clearly visible, positioned right in the center. This observation is based on the common placement of seeds within the center part of fruits like apples.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the apple’s flesh show a dry, fibrous texture with visible vein-like patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image in the package visually conveys the edited apple with clear dry, fibrous texture. The apple's flesh has distinct vein-like patterns, which are typical of a dehydrated apple appearance. These patterns are visible throughout the inner exposed portion of the apple.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a dark brown stem attached to the top of the apple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apple is shown within a packaging box and has a dark brown stem protruding from the top. This is consistent with the typical appearance of apple stems, which are often brown and positioned at the top-center.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apple used in the package display has indeed been sliced vertically, providing a symmetrical cross-section that showcases both sides evenly. This cut allows the cross-section's central seed and texture to be clearly visible, indicating symmetry.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apple is not shown on a surface like in Image A. Instead, it is inside a packaging box as part of a display shelf, adhering to the characteristics of collectible or themed edition items. Therefore, a specific surface like the one described isn’t visible or applicable.",
