    "Question": "Q1: Is the number '1902' clearly visible on the front of the locomotive?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the locomotive bears the number '1002' on its front. This can be seen clearly in the image as a distinct numeric marking. Comparing this with Image A, where the number '1902' is visible, we can conclude that there is a difference in the numbers displayed between the two images, indicating they are not the same. Combining this observation with knowledge of numbering typically used to identify locomotives, Image B does not display '1902'.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is the station building constructed from stone material with visible texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the station building appears more stylized and uses bright, vivid colors, which suggests less realistic details. It does not exhibit a clearly visible stone texture, which contrasts with Image A, where a realistic stone texture is detailed. This can be distinguished by interpreting the artistic depiction method used in Image B, favoring bold colors over realistic textures.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is there moss growing on the roof of the station building?",
    "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the roof of the station building features a brightly colored depiction, lacking fine details such as moss growth. The vibrant, clear-cut style doesn't suggest the presence of moss. In Image A, however, there is visible moss present on the roof, indicating a more realistic aesthetic. This comparison clarifies the absence of such texture in Image B.",

    "Question": "Q5: Are there luggage trunks present on the platform near the passengers?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, on the platform near the passengers, there is one piece of luggage illustrated, which could be considered luggage or a trunk.
