    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the elderly woman’s facial expression, including the gentle smile and visible wrinkles around the eyes and mouth?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the face of the elderly woman is blurred, making it impossible to discern any detailed features such as a gentle smile or visible wrinkles.
