      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is seated on a bench with both feet on the ground, as depicted by the arrangement of the legs shown. This indicates the figure is not in a cross-legged position, which typically involves sitting on the floor with legs crossed.\n",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's right hand is visibly holding the neck of the instrument, not positioned above the strings for plucking, indicating the hand is in more of a holding position rather than a plucking gesture.\n",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left hand of the figure is shown grasping the neck of the instrument and doesn't appear to be pressing any strings, suggesting the hand is in more of a stabilizing rather than playing position.\n",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is facing forward, but the head is not visibly tilted upward; the figure appears to look straight ahead relative to the position of the eyes indicated by the blurred region. Thus, the head is not tilted upward.\n",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure wears a hooded robe instead of a turban, which is dissimilar to the depiction of a turban, where typically cloth is wrapped around the head. Therefore, there is no turban present.\n",

      "is_correct": false
    },
