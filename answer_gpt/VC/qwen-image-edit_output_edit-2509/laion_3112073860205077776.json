      "question": "Is the golden-brown crust of the pie slice present with visible crumbly texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pie slice appears to have a crust depicted with shades of brown. However, the illustration style means the crust lacks the realistic crumbly texture typically seen. Instead, it is represented with smooth lines and blocks of color, indicating the presence of a crust but without a crumbly texture.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dark purple-blue berry filling with visible burst spots present in the pie slice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows berries of a purple-blue hue integrated into the pie slice. However, these berries do not depict visible burst spots as they might in a photograph. Instead, they are stylized elements within the illustration without textural burst details.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is a single green mint leaf placed on top of the pie slice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a mint leaf illustration atop the pie slice. While stylized, it maintains a recognizable leaf shape and color, capturing the mint leaf's presence similar to how it might appear in reality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the pie slice served on a white circular ceramic plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pie slice is depicted resting on a circular plate, illustrated in a manner intended to resemble ceramic, using white coloration. This corresponds to the expected description of a white ceramic plate.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a mug with a handle visible on the right side and stylized features resembling a tea bag string hanging over its rim. Despite the animated style, these elements are consistent with a typical tea mug setup.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's background or surface setting uses a solid color with no distinct texture or shading indicative of a gray tabletop. Unlike the realistic texture in Image A, this illustration doesn't explicitly depict the surface as matte gray.",
