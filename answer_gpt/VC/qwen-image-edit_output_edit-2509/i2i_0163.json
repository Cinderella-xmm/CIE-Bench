      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the slices of bread are positioned just above the slots of the toasters with visible toast marks, indicating that the bread has been toasted.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains visible black control knobs and levers on the toasters, identifiable by their distinct color that contrasts with the metallic body of the toasters.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toasters display a reflective metallic sheen that is evident from the way light interacts with their surface. This sheen is visually consistent with stainless steel or similar materials used in kitchen appliances, designed to enhance both aesthetic appeal and durability.
