    "Question": "Q1: Is the surfboard depicted with an elongated oval shape and a central stringer running along its length?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the surfboard is enclosed within a glass dome, and its shape appears to be an elongated oval, which is a typical shape for surfboards. The central stringer, which is a common structural feature for adding strength, runs along the length of surfboards. In this image, the elongated oval shape is clear, but the presence of a stringer isn't visually discernible. World knowledge suggests the stringer is commonly included, but visually it's not evident.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is there a small white wax block being held by the right hand and applied to the surface of the surfboard?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the hand holding a small object that looks like a wax block. This is based on both the hand's position and what appears to be the object in contact with the surfboard, consistent with the practice of applying surfboard wax. The visual indications give the impression of wax application from the hand's positioning.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the right hand positioned so that the fingers are gripping the wax block and making direct contact with the surfboard’s surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the right hand's fingers are wrapped around a small block, and this positioning indicates direct interaction with the surfboard’s surface. Usually, this grip suggests the action of applying wax. This conclusion is drawn by observing how the fingers are flexed along with the proximity of the block to the surfboard.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the left hand placed flat on the surfboard, parallel to the board’s surface, providing support?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the left hand is not parallel to the surfboard but seems to hover above it within the glass dome setup. The position does not show the palm lying flat or providing evident support as might be expected from certain hand placements when stabilizing a surfboard.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the surfboard’s surface show a granular, textured pattern consistent with wax application?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the surfboard appears smooth as seen through the glass dome, and it lacks visual evidence of a textured, granular pattern typically seen when wax is applied. This assessment is based on the visible surface under lighting conditions that should reveal such textures if present.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the figure positioned in a crouched, forward-leaning posture with knees bent and upper body angled over the surfboard?",
    "explanation": "The figure in Image B is shown in a crouched position, leaning forward over the surfboard with bent knees. This posture is consistent with reaching toward the surfboard to apply wax, exhibiting a typical stance for such an activity. The angle and orientation of the upper body reinforce the appearance of a forward-leaning posture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
