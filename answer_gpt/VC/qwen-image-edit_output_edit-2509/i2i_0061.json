        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is wearing a cap, which appears to be black. By observing the color and position on his head, it can be determined that the cap is intact and still visible, similar to the cap in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man appears to be positioned on a skateboard at the edge of the ramp, indicating balancing. This is based on visual cues like the position of his feet and the object underneath him, which resemble skateboard wheels visible in Image A, although stylized in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's arms are extended outward, which suggests a stance often used for balance during skateboarding. This posture is similar to the stance in Image A where the arms are extended, confirming his balancing intention.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoes appear to be dark in color, indicative of black skate shoes. Despite the stylized effect, the visual position and shape of the shoes resembling skate footwear support this conclusion. Comparison with Image A confirms their color and style.",
