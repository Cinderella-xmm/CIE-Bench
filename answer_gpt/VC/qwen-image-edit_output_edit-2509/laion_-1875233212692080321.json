      "question": "Does the perfume bottle include a shade of pink that matches the \"Rose Pink\" eyeshadow in the original palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The perfume bottle in Image B features a gradient from deep red to a lighter reddish hue. To determine if it matches 'Rose Pink,' one must consider typical shades associated with rose pink, which is often a soft, gentle pink. While the bottle does transition into lighter shades, it predominantly appears darker than a typical 'Rose Pink.' Therefore, the match is not precise.",

      "question": "Is the text \"Anastasia Beverly Hills\" visible on the perfume bottle or its packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a perfume bottle with the text 'Cxmsnaialx' written in gold vertically along the bottle. There is no indication of the text 'Anastasia Beverly Hills.' Based on this visual evidence, that specific brand text is not present on the bottle or any visible packaging.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the perfume bottle feature an external accent in the color \"Burnt Orange\" as seen in the palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The perfume bottle in Image B includes a golden rose accent at the top. 'Burnt Orange' is typically a deeper, reddish-orange shade, different from the bright metallic gold seen. The absence of any such burnt orange hue in the visible details of the bottle indicates no match.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the dual-ended makeup brush visible in the final perfume bottle design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image of the perfume bottle in Image B shows only the bottle with no external elements or accessories like a makeup brush. Given the absence of a dual-ended makeup brush in the visual of the final product, it can be concluded that it is not part of the design.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background of the image a soft pink gradient matching the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B appears to be a plain white or very light color without any distinct gradient, especially the pink shade. This contrasts with the 'soft pink gradient' mentioned for Image A. Hence, the backgrounds do not match.",
