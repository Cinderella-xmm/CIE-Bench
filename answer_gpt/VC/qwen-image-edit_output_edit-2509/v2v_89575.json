      "question": "Is the infinity pool's edge still visible and defining the boundary between the water and the surrounding landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting is a stone relief design, and there is no presence of an infinity pool or water. The boundary typically defined by the pool's edge in Image A is no longer visible in Image B. Instead, Image B features an intricate stone artwork with detailed carvings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the woman still positioned centrally in the pool, maintaining her original orientation relative to the pool's edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene has transformed into a stone sculpture of a deity. The original position of the woman relative to the pool's edge around her is absent in Image B. Instead, there is a prominent stone figure centrally located in the relief. Hence, orientation relative to the pool is irrelevant.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the traditional-style buildings with tiered roofs still visible in the background, integrated into the stone relief design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the detailed carvings do not depict any elements of traditional buildings with tiered roofs. The background consists entirely of the stone relief design, and no building structures like those seen in Image A are visible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the dense tropical foliage, including palm trees, still present in the background, albeit reimagined as part of the stone relief?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any natural foliage or palm trees; the relief art depicts stone carvings that do not incorporate elements resembling tropical plants. The setting is purely artistic and features intricate stone designs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the scene retain a bright and clear lighting effect, consistent with the original sunny day atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B conveys a mood of muted lighting typical for stone reliefs and carvings, not the bright and sunny atmosphere like Image A. The stone texture and shadows give more depth, but it doesn't maintain the sunny day ambiance.",
