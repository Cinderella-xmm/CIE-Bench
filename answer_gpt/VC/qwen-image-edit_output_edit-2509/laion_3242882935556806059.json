    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the individual flower petals shaped like elongated, recurved lily petals with six distinct segments per bloom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the individual flower petals are indeed shaped like typical lily petals. They are elongated and have a recurved form which is characteristic of lily blossoms. Each flower seems to have six distinct segments, which aligns with the common structure of lily flowers. This observation is based on the visual outline and structure of the petals noted in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the bouquet arranged in a tightly packed, spherical cluster with multiple flowers overlapping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bouquet appears to be densely arranged with flowers closely packed together, creating a spherical cluster. The overlapping nature of the flowers is visually evident as some petals are physically positioned over others, which ultimately enhances the perception of a fuller, spherical shape.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a transparent, cylindrical glass vase holding the bouquet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the bouquet being held in a transparent, cylindrical glass vase. The vase has a typical cylindrical shape that is commonly used for floral arrangements, and the transparency of the glass allows the water and the stems inside to be visible, confirming this observation.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the vase positioned directly beneath the bouquet, with stems/rods extending upward from it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is placed directly beneath the bouquet and the stems or rods appear to extend from the vase upwards into the bouquet. This setup is typical for vase arrangements where the structure of the vase supports the stems, allowing the flowers to be displayed prominently above it.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there approximately ten to twelve flowers visible in the bouquet, including both open blooms and closed buds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, by visually counting the flowers and considering both open blooms and any visible buds, the approximate number of flowers appears to be around ten to twelve. This estimation takes into account the density of the arrangement and the visible overlaps that might obscure some flowers, ensuring that most blooms and several buds are considered in the count.",
