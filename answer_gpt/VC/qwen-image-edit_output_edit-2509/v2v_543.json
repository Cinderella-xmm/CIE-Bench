      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the characters still depicted as actively skiing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are dressed in traditional clothing and are positioned in a way that suggests movement typical of skiing, such as extended arms with ski poles. This supports the notion that they are depicted as skiing based on common skiing postures.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the characters still arranged in a line formation while skiing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters form more of a grouped formation and are not in a straight line as one would expect in typical ski formation. With the variation in their positions and traditional setting, this indicates they are not arranged in a line as in competitive or organized skiing.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "question": "Do the characters still hold ski poles and wear skis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are clearly holding ski poles and wearing skis, as it is a key element of skiing that contributes to their depiction as participating in this activity.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there still a visible snowy path beneath the characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does show the characters standing on a white surface consistent with snow, indicating that the snowy path is present as part of the winter landscape commonly associated with skiing.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's characters are positioned in a manner suggesting movement, such as directional body posture and use of ski poles, resembling typical skiing motion. They appear to be progressing along a path, which is consistent with skiing activity.",
