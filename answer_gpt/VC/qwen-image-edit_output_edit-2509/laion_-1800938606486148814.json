      "question": "Is the Swoosh logo present in the same curved shape and located on the lateral side of the midsole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Swoosh logo is visible on the lateral side of the midsole, with a glowing blue design, indicating its presence as part of the futuristic aesthetic of the sneaker. This matches the typical location seen in Image A, where the Swoosh is also placed on the lateral side of the midsole. The shape and curved design of the Swoosh in Image B reflect the common design seen in Nike sneakers, which is confirmed by Image A. Therefore, the Swoosh is present in a similar curved shape and location in both images.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a strap is clearly visible across the midfoot area of the sneaker, with a glowing feature, enhancing the high-tech look of the shoe. This strap is similar to what's seen in Image A, where there is also a strap positioned across the midfoot, albeit without the glowing effect. Both images feature this strap in the same location, fulfilling the functional and aesthetic role in the sneakerâ€™s design.",
