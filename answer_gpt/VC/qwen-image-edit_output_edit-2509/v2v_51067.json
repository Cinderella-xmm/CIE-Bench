      "question": "Does the image retain the Mercedes-Benz grille and logo on the front of the van?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the van prominently features the Mercedes-Benz logo in the center of the grille, which is a clear indication of the brand identity. The grille itself follows the distinct design that is commonly associated with Mercedes-Benz vehicles, featuring horizontal slats with the logo centrally placed. This design detail matches the traditional styling cues of Mercedes-Benz. Based on these observations combined with knowledge of the typical design elements of Mercedes-Benz vans, it can be concluded that the edited image retains the Mercedes-Benz grille and logo.",

      "question": "Is the overall shape and structure of the van consistent with the original Mercedes-Benz Sprinter design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter has a modern and utilitarian design with a tall, rounded roof, vertical sides, and a boxy appearance typical of cargo vans. In Image B, the van adopts a retro styling with distinct curves, chrome details, and a softer shape that diverges significantly from the Sprinter's design. The overall aesthetic is more akin to classic vans commonly used in leisure contexts rather than the utilitarian look of the Sprinter. Therefore, the edited image does not maintain consistency with the original Sprinter design.",

      "question": "Are the wheels placed in the same positions and maintain similar sizes as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From Image A, the van features large wheels with a robust appearance, suitable for heavy-duty use. In Image B, the wheels appear smaller and have a more vintage style, with chrome hubcaps, which indicates a shift in design from utility to aesthetic appeal. The positions of the wheels in both images are consistent with the traditional setup for vans, though the sizing in B seems smaller than in A, not reflecting the same proportions. Thus, the wheels' positions are similar, but their size is not as consistent, leading to the answer being no.",

      "question": "Does the van still have clean lines and no visible side windows on the cargo area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the van's cargo area remains solid with no visible side windows, similar to Image A where the van shows a continuous expanse of metal without window openings in the rear section. The edited image retains this aspect of the design where the side panels are uninterrupted, maintaining clean lines consistent with cargo vehicles intended for maximum storage space. Considering these observations and comparing both images, it is clear the clean lines and absence of visible side windows are maintained.",

      "question": "Does the van retain the large windshield with the same dimensions as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original van in Image A has a large windshield, typical of modern design to enhance visibility. In Image B, the windshield appears to be smaller and harkens to a vintage style with an increased amount of bodywork surrounding it, which is typical of classic van designs. Though Image B does retain a windshield, its dimensions do not match the utilitarian size seen in Image A, altering the overall visibility and aesthetic. Hence, the edited image does not retain the same windshield dimensions.",
