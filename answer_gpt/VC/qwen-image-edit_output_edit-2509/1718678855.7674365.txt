    "Question": "Q1: Is the capybara’s snout broad and flat with a rounded muzzle, consistent with its real-world anatomy?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, although the face of the animal is blurred, the distinct characteristics of a capybara's snout can still be inferred. Capybaras are known for their broad and flat snouts with rounded muzzles. In the original pose, while the face is obscured, these anatomical features are implied by the structure and size of the animal's head and muzzle.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the capybara’s ears small, rounded, and located high on the head?",
    "explanation": "The unblurred sections of Image B show part of the capybara's head and the characteristics of its ears. Capybara ears are small, rounded, and sit high on their heads, which is consistent with general anatomical features of capybaras and inferred from the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the capybara standing upright and facing directly toward the viewer?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the body position seems to be upright but the blurred face suggests a straight-on perspective, hinting that it is facing directly toward the viewer. This posture is often anthropomorphized for animal figures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are both hands positioned in front of the chest, gripping an object?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, despite the face being blurred, the animal's hands are visible and shown to be holding an object in front, consistent with a pose where both hands are positioned in front of the chest gripping an item like a cup of tea.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the capybara’s fur primarily light brown with darker tones around the muzzle?",
    "explanation": "Even with the main facial features blurred, the visible areas of the body in Image B suggest a fur that's predominantly light brown. Capybaras naturally have slight tonal variations, particularly with darker areas around the muzzle, inferred from typical capybara coloring.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the capybara have a stocky, large body with short legs and a thick torso?",
    "explanation": "From Image B, the visible sections support that the capybara possesses a stocky body, conforming to its natural anatomical build, with a thick torso and likely short limbs, consistent with a capybara’s real-world anatomy.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the capybara have four limbs visible or implied by posture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, although only the upper limbs are visible due to the blur and positioning, the posture suggests a typical quadruped anatomy where four limbs are implied by the stance and general body posture of a capybara.",
    "answer": "Yes"
