        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object being examined is a violin. The two symmetrical f-hole shapes are typically found on either side of the bridge area on the body of a violin. These f-holes are visible on the body of the violin in Image B. By observing the body of the instrument in the image and knowing the common design of violins, it is clear that these features are present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the top end of the violin, the scroll with four tuning pegs is visible. The scroll is the decorative carved part of the violin, and the tuning pegs are used to adjust the tension of the strings. This is a typical configuration for violins, and it is present in this image.",

      "question": "Does the object retain the classic violin silhouette with distinct upper and lower bouts and a central waist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the violin has a classic silhouette. This includes distinct upper and lower bouts (the curved areas at the top and bottom of the body) with a central waist (the narrower middle part). This design is a characteristic feature of violins. Observing the shape of the object in the image confirms that this classic silhouette is maintained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a clearly defined bridge area located between the two f-holes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bridge of the violin is the part that supports the strings and is typically found between the f-holes on the body. This area is clearly defined in the image and is a crucial part of the violin's design for support and sound amplification. The image shows this area distinctly between the f-holes on the body.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the object positioned diagonally across the support surface, with the scroll pointing toward the upper right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the violin is placed diagonally in the case on top of a table. The scroll, which is the topmost part of the instrument, is oriented towards the upper right corner of the image. The diagonal positioning is a common way to present violins in cases to fit well. Observing the overall orientation of the violin in the image confirms this positioning.",
