    "Question": "Q1: Are both the main triangular sail and the smaller jib sail present and correctly positioned on the mast?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the boat has large and small sails visible. The sails are made of wood, as evidenced by their textured appearance, resembling wood grain rather than cloth. These sails are attached to the mast, with the main triangular sail taking a prominent position at the center, and a smaller triangular sail in front, serving as a jib. The positioning is consistent with how sails are commonly placed on traditional boats for proper functionality.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is there a single vertical mast located centrally along the length of the boat?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a single mast is visible, protruding vertically from the center of the boat deck, in line with traditional designs for sailboats. The mast is centrally located, supporting the wooden sails and aligning with common sailboat design where a single mast is used for stability and effective sail management.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the boat have a sharply pointed bow extending forward from the hull?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the bow of the boat extending sharply forward, characteristic of dhow boats, which are designed this way to cut through water efficiently. The bow is pointed and elongated, which can be inferred as a design for better hydrodynamics and is typical in many traditional sailing vessels.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a covered section with open sides and vertical railings located over the midsection of the hull?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a section over the midsection of the hull featuring open sides with vertical railings, resembling a covered open-air area. This structure is often found on traditional boats, allowing for passenger seating or cargo storage, providing both openness for viewing and some shelter.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a small red flag attached to the stern of the boat?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is no presence of a small red flag at the stern of the boat. The focus is more on the wooden sails and the structure of the boat itself with no additional attachments like a flag being visible.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the sails, mast, deck, and bow aligned in their original spatial configuration, maintaining the correct proportions and orientation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sails maintain their orientation and size relative to the mast and deck. The proportions and arrangements are respectful of traditional dhow designs, ensuring functionality and aesthetics. Each element such as the mast and sails, deck, and bow are coherently placed as would be expected in a real sailing vessel.",
    "answer": "Yes"
