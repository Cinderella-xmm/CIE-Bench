    "Question": "Q1: Is the wooden surface with visible grain patterns and warm brown tones present and unaltered in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden surface is visible with grain patterns and brown tones, similar to Image A. This suggests the surface remains largely unchanged between the images. Visual information corresponds with common knowledge of wooden textures, which are consistent under similar lighting and conditions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the two feather pendants positioned such that one is in the foreground and the other is partially overlapped behind it, maintaining the original diagonal alignment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the feathers appear to maintain a similar diagonal alignment as seen in Image A. The positioning indicates one feather is in the foreground while another is partly overlapped, which corresponds with spatial arrangements often utilized for depth in images.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the pendants cast soft, consistent shadows beneath them on the wooden surface, indicating overhead lighting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a noticeable illumination effect on and around the pendants which seems to distract from perceivable shadows on the wooden surface. This extensive glowing effect suggests lighting sources different from typical overhead lighting which would create softer shadows.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the pendants aligned diagonally across the frame, extending from the lower-left toward the upper-right?",
    "explanation": "Observing Image B shows pendants diagonally positioned from lower-left to upper-right, similar to Image A. This arrangement follows typical compositional practices for balance and visual flow in images.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the wooden surface retain its natural grain texture, including variations in tone and minor imperfections, without digital smoothing or enhancement?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a wooden surface that displays natural grain texture and tone variations similar to Image A. There is no visible evidence of digital smoothing or enhancement altering these characteristics, indicating retention of the original surface's features.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the edge of the leather feather clearly defined against the wooden surface, showing a slight separation and shadow?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the feather pendants undergo significant transformations, including vibrant colors and glowing effects, detracting from clear edge definition and minimal shadowing against the wooden surface as evidenced in Image A. This alteration implies decreased clarity in edge definition.",
    "answer": "No"
