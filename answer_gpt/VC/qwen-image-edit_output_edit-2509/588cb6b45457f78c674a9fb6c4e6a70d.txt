    "Question": "Q3: Are the lips thin, closed, and slightly upturned at the corners, forming a neutral yet thoughtful expression?",
    "explanation": "Examining if the lips are thin, closed, and slightly upturned involves observing lip thickness, closure, and the mouth's corners for subtle upward curves that convey expression.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the face proportionally balanced, with equal spacing between the eyes and symmetrical distribution of facial features?",
    "explanation": "Proportional balance can be assessed by measuring equal spacing and symmetry in facial features, ensuring all elements are evenly distributed.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the left ear partially visible, emerging from under the hair near the temple?",
    "explanation": "Visibility of the left ear would be identified by the ear's partial appearance near the temple, slightly obscured by hair.",

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there soft shadows along the right side of the face and under the jawline, created by directional lighting from the left?",
    "explanation": "Soft shadows would appear along the face and jawline's right side if the lighting comes from the left, creating depth and shape through contrast.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the head centered above the shoulders, with no unnatural tilt or rotation?",
