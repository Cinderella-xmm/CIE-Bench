    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the astronaut's face visible through a clear, circular helmet visor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the helmet visor is depicted as clear and circular, allowing the face to be visible. This is evident through visual cues suggesting a transparent covering over the head. Based on general knowledge about astronaut helmets, they typically feature clear visors for visibility.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a red, white, and blue American flag patch located on the left shoulder of the suit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a red, white, and blue American flag patch is visible on the left shoulder of the suit. This can be identified by familiar flag patterns and colors typically used to represent the United States. Such patches are commonly seen on astronaut suits to denote nationality.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a large, boxy life-support pack attached to the astronaut’s back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a large, boxy life-support pack is clearly attached to the astronaut’s back. This feature is evident through its rectangular shape and typical placement as depicted in many astronaut suit designs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible segmented joints at the elbows and knees of the spacesuit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays segmented joints at the elbows and knees which are consistent with the design of many spacesuits that allow for flexibility and movement. These segmented areas are visible in the illustration.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there visible dust being kicked up from the lunar surface beneath the astronaut’s right boot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible dust being kicked up from the lunar surface beneath the astronaut’s right boot. The illustration lacks any indications of motion or particles near the boot area.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is a bright, spherical Earth visible in the sky behind the astronaut?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of Earth in the sky behind the astronaut. Instead, the background features starry elements without any large spherical planet-like object identifiable as Earth.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the helmet shaped as a smooth, circular dome with a reflective outer surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the helmet as a smooth, circular dome consistent with common helmet shapes, but it lacks a reflective outer surface. The illustration style does not emphasize any reflective qualities typical of actual astronaut helmets.",
