    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the layered petal structure around the rim of each vase, with individual petal shapes clearly visible and arranged in concentric rows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase showcases a smooth and marbled surface with golden outlines highlighting the petal structure. The petals are still prominently visible, retaining their distinct, individual shapes and are arranged in layers around the rim, much like the style of an artichoke. The gold embellishment reinforces the petal outlines, emphasizing their concentric arrangement around the vase's rim. This layered petal structure is crucial for both decorative function and form, which is preserved in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there exactly two vases present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the image displays only one vase that is fully visible in front of its box packaging. The packaging behind suggests the presence of another vase but does not visibly present the second vase, therefore the quantity explicitly shown is just one vase.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the interior of each vase still open and bowl-shaped, allowing visibility into the cavity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible vase indeed maintains a bowl-shaped opening at the top, providing clear visibility into its interior cavity. The petals form an outer rim around this opening, similar to a floral or artichoke pattern, allowing us to understand that its functional structure as a vase is retained.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does each vase have a distinct, flared pedestal base beneath the main body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the vase having a base that flares out, which functions both for stability and aesthetic design. The pedestal base provides elevation and balances the wide, heavy upper portion, supporting the intent that this is consistent with typical pedestal vases.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the two vases identical in shape, size, and orientation, with only minor positional offset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, only one vase is visibly displayed alongside its packaging box. There isn't a second, distinct vase present to compare for identical characteristics or orientation with the one shown. Therefore, it lacks evidence of two identical vases with only a positional offset.",
