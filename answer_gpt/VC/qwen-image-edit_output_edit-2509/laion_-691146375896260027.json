    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the overall bombe (curved, outward-bulging) silhouette of the commode preserved in the LEGO version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, the LEGO version, attempts to replicate the bombe silhouette using LEGO bricks. While LEGO blocks have a blocky texture, the builder has captured the essence of the outward-bulging curve. This is evident from the curved outline of the sides and front of the piece, reflecting the characteristic bombe shape, despite the inherent angular nature of LEGO bricks. The understanding here is that the overall silhouette can be preserved in form and intention, even if the texture and material differ.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there exactly two drawers stacked vertically on the front of the dresser, each framed by brass mounts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO version shows two distinct horizontal separations on the front, suggesting two drawers. The yellow/ochre colored bricks that mimic the brass mounts frame these divisions, indicating that this feature is preserved, similar to what is observable in Image A, where two drawers are distinctly visible and framed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the herringbone and starburst marquetry pattern visible on the front of both drawers in the LEGO version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO version in Image B does not present the intricate herringbone or starburst marquetry designs that are visible in Image A. The details of such patterns require small and precise crafting, which is not feasible with the larger and less detailed LEGO pieces, thus in the LEGO rendition, these patterns are mostly absent.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the ornate brass mounts with acanthus leaf scrolls present around the edges of both drawers and along the side panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO version in Image B attempts to mimic the ornate brass mounts with yellow bricks. However, due to the blocky nature of LEGO, the intricate details such as acanthus leaf scrolls are not reproduced. Instead, the general placement and color imply the presence of these mounts, but the finer details cannot be accurately captured in this medium.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the legs curve outward in a cabriole fashion and terminate in brass sabots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the legs of the LEGO dresser do have an attempt to express a slight outward curvature, mimicking the cabriole style, and they appear to include yellow bricks at the bottom to suggest brass sabots. However, due to the restrictions of blocky LEGO bricks, the curvature is minimal and lacks the finesse of real cabriole legs as seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a scalloped apron below the drawers, following the curve of the bombe shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO version does portray some indentation below the drawers to represent a scalloped apron, conforming somewhat to the bombe curve. This feature is achieved through the careful placement of LEGO bricks, attempting to mirror the flow seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top surface of the LEGO commode is rectangular and flush with the upper edge of the dresser body. This aspect mirrors the design in Image A where the top is a polished marble and distinctly flat compared to the more ornate and curved body of the dresser.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are the decorative elements (brass mounts, marquetry, legs) symmetrically arranged on both sides of the dresser?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the LEGO version (Image B), the builder has aimed for a symmetrical arrangement of the decorative elements within the capabilities of LEGO design. The yellow bricks suggest symmetry in the framing of the drawers and the sides, similar to the traditional symmetry present in Image A. This understanding is based on recognizing symmetrical design as a common feature in such furniture pieces.",
