    "Question": "Q1: Is the mechanical eyepatch with visible screws and metallic surface present on the central characterâ€™s right eye?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows three characters in hats and trench coats, and none of them are wearing eyepatches. The visual cues suggest a noir-style setting without any mechanical eyepatch. Comparing with Image A, the central character has a mechanical eyepatch with visible screws on his right eye. Therefore, in Image B, the feature is absent.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the central character holding an open book in both hands?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, one of the characters is holding an open book in one hand. There's no indication of holding it with both hands due to the position and style of the illustration. In Image A, the central character is holding an open book in one hand, further supporting the visualization in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there visible Chinese-style calligraphy on the cover of the book held by the central character?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the book's cover isn't visible with clear calligraphy details, as the character holds it in a noir-styled illustration and the emphasis is more on the grayscale and textures. Image A displays a book with stylized typography on the cover, recognizable as Chinese-style calligraphy. Therefore, Image B does not have visible Chinese-style calligraphy.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the central character have short, straight black hair?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows characters wearing hats, obscuring any direct view of hair. From deductions, the noir style suggests concealed hairstyles for thematic consistency. Image A has a character with short, straight black hair prominently visible. Thus, Image B does not show this feature visibly.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there four distinct supporting characters visible in the background, including one with white hair, one with purple hair, one with blue hair, and one with dark hair and red eyes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, only three characters are distinctively visible, all wearing hats and trench coats, matching the noir aesthetic without specific hair details. Image A features colorful supporting characters with distinct hair colors, including white, purple, and blue. Therefore, Image B does not present them as described.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the central character have a calm, neutral facial expression with a slightly downward gaze?",
    "explanation": "Image B's central character holds a magnifying glass, reflecting focus and concentration but doesn't explicitly display a downward gaze due to face blurring. Image A's character has a calm look with his head slightly tilted downward, visually emphasized through detailed illustration. Image B doesn't visually convey such an expression clearly due to the style.",
    "answer": "No"
