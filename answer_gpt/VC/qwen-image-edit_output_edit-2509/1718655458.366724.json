      "question": "Is the flowing brown and gray marbled pattern visible on the surfaces of the LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks are clearly showing a design with marbled patterns. These patterns include swirls and flows that resemble natural marble veining, characterized by both brown and gray colors. This observation is based on the visual cues such as the irregular, smooth marbled textures visible on the surfaces of the LEGO pieces. The design resembles a flowing, natural marble pattern rather than a simple or plain surface.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the LEGO bricks rendered with a white base color accented by warm brown and gray marbling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts LEGO bricks that have a predominant white base. The marbled accents, which feature warm brown and gray hues, add artistic texture and depth to the bricks. This is evident from the visual observation of the overall color scheme, where white serves as the primary color complemented by the marbling.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the marbled veins follow an organic, irregular flow rather than a geometric or repetitive pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The marbling pattern on the LEGO bricks in Image B appears organic and irregular, similar to natural marble. This is deduced from the observable swirling and flowing pattern of the veins, which do not repeat in a geometric or symmetrical manner. They possess variations that are characteristic of naturally occurring marbled stone, indicating an organic style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both warm brown and gray veins present together in the marbled pattern of the LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon visual examination, Image B shows that the marbling on the LEGO bricks incorporates both warm brown and gray veins. Both colors are evident in the pattern, contributing to the marble-like appearance, with each color interwoven throughout the design, adding complexity and depth to the bricksâ€™ surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the LEGO bricks visually appear to be made of a marble-like material based on their surface pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks exhibit a surface pattern similar to marble, which is achieved through the marbled veins in brown and gray against a white base. This patterning suggests a material with a luxurious, marble-like quality. Visually, this gives the impression that the LEGO bricks are crafted from a marble-like material, enhancing their aesthetic appeal.",
