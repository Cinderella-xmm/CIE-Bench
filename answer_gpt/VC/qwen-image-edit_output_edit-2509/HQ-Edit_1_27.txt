```json
{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the central pathway extend directly toward the Eiffel Tower, creating a strong linear perspective with convergence at the towerâ€™s base?",
    "explanation": "The snow globe in Image B has a pathway leading directly to the Eiffel Tower, creating an effective linear perspective that converges at the base of the structure. This matches the visual effect typical of Parisian scenes with the tower as a focal point.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
```

```json
{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the ground fully covered in snow, with visible accumulation around the base of the tower and along the path?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe interior shows the ground covered in snow, evident along the path and around the base of the Eiffel Tower. This detail is consistent with the wintry theme depicted in the miniature model.",
    "answer": "Yes"
