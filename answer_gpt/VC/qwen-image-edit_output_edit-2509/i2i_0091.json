      "question": "Is the original lighting style, including the placement and intensity of shadows, preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting style is atmospheric and more focused on artificial lighting, like the sconces on the walls. This contrasts with Image A, where natural light enters from windows, casting distinct shadows. The focus on artificial lighting in Image B changes the placement and intensity of shadows, indicating that the lighting style has been altered.",

      "question": "Are the items on the chest of drawers arranged in a similar fashion to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no chest of drawers visible at all. The scene shows a corridor-like interior of a gothic architecture style space, unlike the well-decorated interior in Image A where the chest of drawers has books and decorative items placed on it. This indicates a complete change in the scene, including item arrangement.",

      "question": "Is the wooden parquet flooring texture still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flooring appears to be made of stone, characteristic of a castle or old architectural hallway. This is different from the wooden parquet flooring visible in Image A, which features a distinct pattern and texture associated with wooden flooring. The presence of stone flooring in Image B means the wooden parquet is absent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a large piece of furniture serving as the primary storage unit in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is devoid of furniture as it depicts a spacious stone hallway typical of gothic architecture, with pillars and archways. In contrast, Image A features a chest of drawers which serves as a primary storage unit. The complete absence of such a piece in Image B clearly indicates a shift from a furnished room to an architectural hallway.",

    {

      "question": "Is natural light still illuminating the scene from the same direction as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is minimal with some natural light entering through the windows, casting shadows that align with the light direction but not as prominently as in Image A. Image A has direct, strong natural light coming from a window angle, casting sharp shadows onto the floor and furniture. Image B focuses more on dimly lit conditions suitable for its gothic theme, showing a change in how light and shadows behave.",
