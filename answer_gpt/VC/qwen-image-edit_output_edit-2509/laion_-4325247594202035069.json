      "question": "Is the figure in the top-right corner still shown with its right arm raised high, holding a weapon aloft?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which features colorful animated fish, there are no human-like figures holding weapons. The objects present are sea creatures in vibrant environments, distinct from those in Image A, which has miniature figurines with raised arms and axes. Thus, the figures and their poses in Image A don't appear in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the figure in the bottom-left corner still show a hand gripping a curved blade in its right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a depiction of underwater fishes with no signs of humanoid figures or weapons. In Image A, the hand gripping the curved blade is part of a figurine, which doesn't fit the context of the marine scene filled with non-humanoid fishes in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the figure in the bottom-left corner still in a kneeling position with one knee on the ground and the other leg bent forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The second image displays fish in an underwater setting with no logical concept of kneeling or human-like figures. Such an interpretation, including poses like kneeling, is absent amidst the vibrant fish from Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the figure in the top-left corner still face slightly to the left with its head turned toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows fish in an aquatic scene, completely shifting away from human-like figurine arrangements. Therefore, any directionality or specific positioning of a figurine's head in Image A is not relevant in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the figure in the bottom-right corner still hold a long, vertical weapon in its right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In contrast to the first image, the second one does not include figures capable of holding objects such as a long, vertical weapon. These are non-existent among the depicted sea creatures in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the left leg of the top-right figure still bent backward, supporting a forward lunge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Fishes shown in Image B cannot exhibit features like leg positioning as seen with the figurines in Image A, such as bending backward or lunging poses. Hence, the quasi-human characteristics are irrelevant here.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a skull-shaped pendant visible around the neck of the bottom-right figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformation from the brown figurines in Image A to the visually different, colorful fish in Image B means the ornamental details like a skull-shaped pendant don't manifest in Image Bâ€™s undersea fauna.",
