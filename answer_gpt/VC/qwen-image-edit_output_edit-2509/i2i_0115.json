      "question": "Does the edited image retain the figure's iconic screaming posture and facial expression, including the wide-open mouth and hands on ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the figure maintains the iconic posture with hands on ears that is characteristic of the 'The Scream' painting. The depiction suggests a similar sense of an overwhelmed emotional expression, although the face is blurred, making it impossible to confirm the wide-open mouth. Nevertheless, the overall body stance with hands on ears is preserved, indicating the screaming posture.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the figure still wearing the blue garment and has the same pale face as in the original painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the figure continues to wear a blue garment, similar to the original painting. The face, while blurred, appears visually consistent with the pale depiction from the original due to the light tones used around the blurred section.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the figure positioned on what appears to be the edge of a bridge or platform, similar to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the background has significantly changed to a war-like scene with explosions, losing the bridge or platform context entirely. The figure is now standing amidst a battlefield scene, rather than the original setting of a bridge overlooking water.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image retains the general artistic style of using distorted and swirling lines, especially noticeable in the blue garment. This artistic technique continues to evoke a sense of unrest and fear, although the lines are less pronounced compared to the original due to the new background context.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image maintains a similar swirled brushstroke style in the depiction of the figure's garment and the background explosion. This technique connects it with the expressive style of the original, lending it a sense of dynamic motion and emotional intensity, albeit in a focused explosive context.",
