    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the large tree trunk with textured bark positioned on the left side of the image, partially obscuring the rear wheel of the bicycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a tree trunk located on the left side providing a backdrop to the scene, but it does not obscure any part of the bicycle which is clearly visible in its entirety. The tree trunk does not appear to interfere with the visibility of the bicycle's rear wheel.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the bicycle make direct contact with the tree trunk, leaning against it on its left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a stylized and cartoonish representation in which the bicycle stands independently, not physically leaning against the tree trunk or making contact with it; the tree provides a background but does not interact with the bicycle's positioning.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a continuous road stretching from the foreground into the background, aligned horizontally across the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a pathway decorated by flowers that extends from the foreground into the background. This pathway is gently curving rather than horizontally aligned, and is distinct from the typical straight road seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there exactly three motorcyclists riding in a straight line along the road in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a whimsical and simplified environment with children cycling down a path. There are no motorcyclists present riding in a straight line, unlike Image A where there are visible motorcyclists.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the bicycle located on the left side of the image, with the road and motorcyclists positioned to the right and extending into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycle is indeed positioned towards the left side of the image, but there is a pathway with cycling children instead of a road with motorcyclists extending into the distance on the right.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the rear wheel of the bicycle partially obscured by the tree trunk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycle is fully visible with no obstruction of the rear wheel by the tree trunk, unlike Image A where the tree might obscure parts of objects behind it.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a round headlight mounted on the front fork of the bicycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B accurately illustrates a round headlight mounted on the front fork of the stylized bicycle, maintaining an element similar to the more realistic setting in Image A.",
