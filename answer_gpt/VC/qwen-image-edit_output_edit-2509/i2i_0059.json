        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the steak is replaced by a mechanical elephant, indicating a shift from a food-related visual to a steampunk-themed fantasy visual. There is no cooked steak visible in Image B at all. Therefore, the appearance of the steak from Image A is not retained in Image B.",
