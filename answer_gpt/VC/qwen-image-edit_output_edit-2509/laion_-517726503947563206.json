      "question": "Is the text \"Aurora\" visible on the side of the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure depicted is a crystal palace rather than a traditional ship, characterized by its intricate and crystalline design with gem-like elements. Despite resembling a floating structure, it lacks the conventional hull where such text would commonly appear. The absence of clear textual elements or places typical for ship names explains why 'Aurora' is not visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the registration number \"QV-8880\" visible on the hull of the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a traditional ship with a hull where a registration number might typically be displayed. The structure appears to be entirely made of crystal-like materials, with no visible markers or numbers, which visually indicates the absence of 'QV-8880'.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is a red flag visible at the top of the shipâ€™s mast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible mast on the crystalline structure. Instead of elements like masts typically found on ships, the image depicts tower-like or dome-like structures made entirely of crystal, which do not support flag presence, thereby leading to the absence of a red flag.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the ship oriented in a side profile view, facing toward the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a crystal palace-like structure, which does not conform to traditional ship orientation as seen in side profiles. The symmetrical and intricate design defies the conventional ship side profile view, making it difficult to discern a distinct right-facing direction.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the ship depicted as floating on a body of water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal-like structure in Image B appears to be situated over a reflective surface that resembles water. Although unconventional, the mirrored effect suggests a floating appearance, supporting the impression of being over water.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the ship positioned near the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal palace structure occupies a central position within the frame. Its prominence and symmetrical design ensure its positioning near the overall center of the image.",
