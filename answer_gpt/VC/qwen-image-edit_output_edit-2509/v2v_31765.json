    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the pile of diced vegetables on the left side of the image orange in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents an abstract art style, with geometric shapes and bold colors. The left side includes orange hues, which could symbolize the color of carrots in a non-literal manner. Given the abstract style, color representations might not align with realistic depictions.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the green vegetable pieces in the center of the image have a curved, C-shaped form with a visible hollow center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central region consists of rounded and segmented shapes suggesting green vegetables, albeit in an abstract manner. These could symbolize cut celery with their curves and sectional appearance but lack literal forms due to the abstraction.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the diced vegetables on the right side of the image pale white or translucent in appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are abstract white elements scattered across the image, some concentrated on the right side. Although they differ from diced onions in realism, the use of white suggests a symbolic representation of white vegetables.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a knife with a metallic blade and black handle located in the upper right portion of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses abstract shapes and colors, and a prominent shape resembling a knife can be seen elongated in the lower right part of the image. Its placement and form are not exact but suggestive of a knife.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the surface beneath the vegetables and knife a wooden cutting board with visible horizontal grain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is made up of blends of colors and shapes, without distinctly portraying a wooden cutting board or any grain patterns. The colors and forms do not symbolize a cutting board directly.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the three piles of vegetables arranged in a triangular pattern with carrots on the left, celery in the middle, and onions on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a non-traditional, abstract art approach with no discernible triangular arrangement of objects. The colors and shapes may suggest different vegetables but not in an orderly triangular pattern as seen in a realistic image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the knife placed diagonally across the upper right area of the image, adjacent to the pile of onions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an element resembling a knife crossing diagonally, but more within the lower right quadrant of the composition rather than the upper right. Its location and abstract style differ significantly from a realistic presentation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
