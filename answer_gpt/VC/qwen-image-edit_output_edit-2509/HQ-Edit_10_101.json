      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair appears silver with neatly styled waves, and the beard visible on the subject seems white.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a dark teal turtleneck sweater beneath the subject's cardigan. The color is distinctly visible and contrasts with the cardigan, offering clarity that the sweater is indeed dark teal. This matches the garment seen in the original image.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases wallpaper with distinct floral and vine motifs in soft pink and cream colors against a teal background. These decorative elements are intricately designed, matching standard floral wallpaper motifs familiar in vintage or decorative settings. This description aligns with the wallpaper design in Image A.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B shows the subject seated and turned slightly to the right, the facial expression and gaze details cannot be discerned due to the blurred face. Hence, the soft smile and upward gaze cannot be confirmed distinctly from what can be inferred from the visual cues in the edited image.",
