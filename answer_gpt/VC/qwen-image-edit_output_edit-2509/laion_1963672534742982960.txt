    "Question": "Q1: Are the eyes of the figure still bright blue with clearly visible irises?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is depicted inside a snow globe with a blurred face, making it impossible to observe the eyes directly. Therefore, based on this observation, the question about the eyes' appearance cannot be confirmed.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the facial texture still characterized by deep, horizontal and vertical wrinkles and a cracked, stone-like pattern?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's facial details are obscured within the snow globe, and the overall appearance favors a smoother and more cartoonish style rather than a stone-like texture. This suggests a change from the original's description.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the figure still shown with long, white hair extending past the shoulders?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, despite a blurred face, it's clear that the figure retains long, white hair extending past the shoulders, with the design matching a common depiction of fantasy characters.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the figure still have a full, white beard covering the lower face?",
    "explanation": "The lower face of the figure in Image B does not show a full white beard, modelled more as a cartoon-like figure without detailed beard features, indicating a departure from the original's description.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the facial contours, including the jawline and cheekbones, still clearly defined and consistent with the original?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe figure with a blurred face does not clearly define the jawline and cheekbones, differing from the emphasis on facial contours in the original.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the neck still visibly defined and structured, showing a clear transition from head to torso?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figureâ€™s neck area is not distinct due to the snow globe's design, which typically reduces emphasis on anatomical definition, contrasting with the description from the original.",
    "answer": "No"
