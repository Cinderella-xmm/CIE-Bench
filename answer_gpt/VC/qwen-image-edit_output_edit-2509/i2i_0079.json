        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a black drawer cabinet beneath the round mirror. I can identify it by its visual style, features, and the fact that it is similar in design to typical drawer cabinets commonly seen in furniture collections. Although positioned slightly differently, the cabinet remains a consistent element from Image A to Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror is positioned on top of and attached to the cabinet, differing from Image A where it is wall-mounted. Despite the positional change, the shape remains round and retains its size relative to the scene.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
