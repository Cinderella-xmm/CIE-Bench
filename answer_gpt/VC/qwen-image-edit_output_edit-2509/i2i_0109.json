      "question": "Does the plastic figurine still hold a hammer that glows with blue lightning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine is holding a hammer that emits a distinct blue glow, indicative of lightning or energy, which matches with how Thor's hammer is often depicted in media. This is a common characteristic associated with Thor's hammer, Mjolnir. The visual cue of the blue glow from the hammer in Image B directly suggests that the glowing lightning effect is retained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine is wearing a black armor that displays metallic and gold accents, similar to what is typically associated with Thor's costume. The intricate design and color scheme are visible and resemble the traditional depictions of Thor's armor. This suggests that the detailed armor is retained in the figurine.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a figurine with a red cape draped over its shoulders. The cape is a significant part of Thor's costume, often seen in superhero portrayals. The visual cue of the cape in the edited image supports that this element is retained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine displays long blond hair, which is consistent with Thor's traditional appearance in mythology and popular media. However, the beard is not discernible in the figurine, possibly due to visual or design aspects related to the figurine. Based on this, the representation of hair is accurate, but the beard is not visibly retained.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pose in Image B depicts the figurine in a standing position holding the hammer, similar to the stance seen in Image A. Without any major differences in the body positioning between the two images, it indicates that the pose is maintained.",
