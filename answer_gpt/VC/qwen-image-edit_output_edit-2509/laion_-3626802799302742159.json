    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the cookies still golden-yellow in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cookies appear as small characters with facial expressions, arms, and legs, but they retain their golden-yellow color. The visual information, combined with common knowledge of cookie coloring, allows us to conclude that their color hasn't changed.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a red jam filling in the center of each cookie?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows cookies as characters with red jam-like centers. Given the visual cues and understanding of cookie decoration, it can be confirmed that the red jam filling is present in the cookies.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the mug white with black speckles and a handle on the right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mug retains its white color with black speckles, despite having a face added to it. The handle appears on the right side, which matches common mug designs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the plate pink with a speckled texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not have a plate; instead, cookies are presented as characters on a floral-patterned cloth. Therefore, the description of a pink speckled plate does not apply to this image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are some cookies inside the mug and others arranged on the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, some cookies are in the mug, which takes on a personified form. Cookies are depicted interacting outside the mug, but not specifically arranged on a plate as they are pictured on a floral cloth.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do both the mug and the plate have a speckled surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mug in Image B is speckled, but there is no plate present in this image which makes the evaluation of two speckled surfaces incorrect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the mug smaller than the plate and positioned centrally on it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a plate. The mug is depicted as a character with cookies inside. There is no indication of a plate in the edited version, logically concluding that the mug cannot be on a plate.",
