    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes green in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes depicted in Image B are blue in color, characterized by prominent eyelashes and large, stylized circular shapes commonly seen in chibi or cartoon-like illustrations. Green is not the present color, thus the answer is based on visual inspection.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the lipstick applied in a rich red shade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual inspection of the chibi keychain in Image B reveals that the lipstick is depicted in a bright, rich red color, matching typical lipstick shades, thereby confirming its rich red appearance.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the subject looking upward and toward the upper left of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes of the chibi character in Image B are depicted as looking straightforward, directly at the viewer, and are not oriented towards any specific direction such as upward or upper left. Therefore, the directional gaze does not match the upward and left orientation described.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the left shoulder bare and visible in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no distinct shoulder is visible as the image focuses solely on the facial elements and stylized representations of hair. Hence, there is an absence of any foreground depiction of shoulders.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a pinkish, textured material partially visible near the lower left edge of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi keychain in Image B does not show any pinkish textured material. Instead, it strictly represents stylized face and head designs without any added textures or materials visible within the scope of the image. Therefore, the representation does not match the description.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there soft highlights on the cheekbones and jawline created by directional lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting on the chibi character's face in Image B appears evenly distributed, with no visible highlights on specific facial structures such as cheekbones or jawline. The illustration style uses colors rather than lighting to emphasize features, hence negating any dynamic light effects.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the facial features symmetrically aligned with balanced spacing between the eyes, nose, and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial structure of the chibi design in Image B appears symmetrically arranged, as is typical in such stylized depictions where balance and symmetry are often prioritized for aesthetic reasons. The spacing between the eyes, nose, and mouth reflects this symmetrical alignment.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    }
