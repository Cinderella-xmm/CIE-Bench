      "question": "Does the edited image retain the intricate wrought-iron lattice structure of both Eiffel Towers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which depicts a snow globe featuring the Eiffel Tower, the structure retains the visually recognizable intricate design typical of the Eiffel Tower, including its commonly known wrought-iron lattice work. The detail within the snow globe mimics the real Eiffel Tower's structure. Thus, the edited image retains the intricate lattice design.",

      "question": "Are both towers supported by a triangular base composed of four distinct pillars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a snow globe with a single Eiffel Tower rather than two. The base of the tower appears stylized with the typical four-pillared design but is not distinctly visible as triangular due to the scale and representation. Therefore, the edited image cannot be confirmed to depict two towers with triangular bases composed of four distinct pillars.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a clearly defined archway beneath each tower through which the path passes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the Eiffel Tower within a snow globe format. While the iconic archway is present at the base of the Eiffel Tower, it is part of a diorama, and it is not clear if a path explicitly passes through it given the presentation within the snow globe. Thus, the path isn't clearly defined beneath the tower.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there exactly two Eiffel Towers present in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene features a single Eiffel Tower within a snow globe rather than two. This depiction focuses on a solitary tower surrounded by other iconic architectural structures within the globe.",

      "question": "Does each tower have a pointed spire at its apex?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a snow globe with one Eiffel Tower, which visually maintains the characteristic pointed spire at its apex, an architectural feature of the Eiffel Tower. However, since there is only one Eiffel Tower depicted, only this single tower can be evaluated, confirmed to have a spire.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there three distinct horizontal platform levels visible along the height of each tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is one Eiffel Tower depicted in the snow globe. The structure does show the typical levels associated with the Eiffel Tower, but the intricacy and limited space within the snow globe format may not explicitly identify three distinct platform levels as they are more stylized. So, the clarity of platform levels is not confirmed.",
