      "question": "Is the donut-shaped object retaining a circular form with a central hole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top panels depict donut-shaped characters that hold spears and shields, giving an impression of circular forms with central holes. This shape is commonly associated with donuts, which are traditionally round with a hole in the middle. Based on visual cues and world knowledge, they are retaining a circular form with central holes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the donut retain its golden-brown baked color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the donut-shaped characters have a color consistent with what is typically seen in donuts, which are golden-brown due to baking. This is evident from the color of the donut-like characters throughout the panels.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the surface of the donut covered in visible coarse granulated sugar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the donut-shaped characters do not feature visible coarse granulated sugar on their surface. These characters are depicted as smoother entities, typical of illustrations, without granular sugar texture.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible individual sugar granules on the donut’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the donut-like characters do not exhibit individual sugar granules on their surface. The illustration style does not lend itself to detailing such textures; hence, no granules are visible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the donut’s body formed as a continuous ring with a central opening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the donut-shaped characters appear to have a design resembling a ring with a central opening, aligned with the notion of a donut. This continuous ring form is consistent across the characters shown.",
