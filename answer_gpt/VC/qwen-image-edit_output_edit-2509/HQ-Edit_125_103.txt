    "Question": "Q2: Is there a white clustered flower located next to the pink peony on the teapot?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a cylindrical tea container with golden floral motifs on its red surface. There is no visual evidence of a teapot with a pink peony or clustered white flowers. Since a teapot isn't visible in Image B, the correct response is 'No' for this question.",
