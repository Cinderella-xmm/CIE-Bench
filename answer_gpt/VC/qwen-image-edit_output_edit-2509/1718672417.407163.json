      "question": "Are the ears upright and positioned symmetrically on top of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the subject is wearing a Viking helmet with large, upward-pointing horns. These horns are symmetrically positioned on top of the helmet. The design is typical for Viking-themed imagery, where horned helmets are iconic elements. Therefore, based on the visual cues, the answer is that the ears, in this case, refer to the helmet's horns, which are upright and symmetrically positioned.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visual cues indicating the presence of glasses on the subject. The focus is on the Viking helmet, armor, and environmental elements such as runestones. Without evidence of glasses, the analysis concludes that no dark-framed glasses are positioned over the eyes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any visual cues of a red patterned bandana wrapped around the forehead. The subject's head is adorned with a detailed Viking helmet, which does not include or allow space for a bandana. The ornate helmet covers the forehead area thoroughly.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is illustrated with long, decorative braids extending from the helmet area rather than the neck. These braids are consistent with the representation of hair rather than fur. This is characteristic of Viking imagery, where warriors often have long braided hair.",
