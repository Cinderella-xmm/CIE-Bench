    "Question": "Q1: Is the clock face still white after the edit?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face is directly visible. The color of the face remains white, as seen in Image B where the interior of the clock face clearly shows a plain white background without any other colors. The use of white is a default design choice for minimalist clocks, which helps the black and red hands stand out for better readability.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are both the hour and minute hands still black after the edit?",
    "explanation": "Observing Image B, the clock hands include an hour and a minute hand, both of which are black. This matches standard design practices where black hands provide good contrast against a white clock face to enhance readability. Thus, they remain unchanged after the edit.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there still a red second hand on the clock after the edit?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a thin hand is visible in a bright color. Based on the standard design of clocks where the second hand is usually thinner and often differentiated by color for easy recognition, we see a red second hand distinctively placed with the black hour and minute hands.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the orange pivot point still present after the edit?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the center of the clock where all three hands meet is marked by a distinct orange pivot point. This is a common design feature to add a subtle but visually striking element to the clock, complementing the black and red hands.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the clock face remain free of numbers or markings after the edit?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the clock face appears to be completely free of any numbers or markings. This design choice aligns with minimalist clocks, where the absence of numbers allows for a sleek and modern look, usually intended for an audience capable of estimating time without needing the exact hour markers.",
    "answer": "Yes"
