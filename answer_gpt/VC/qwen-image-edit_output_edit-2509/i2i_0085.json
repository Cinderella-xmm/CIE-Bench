        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see a framed painting on the wall featuring orange-yellow trees along the river under a setting sun, which matches the description. The presence of trees with autumnal colors along a body of water and the sun setting are easily recognizable elements. This is consistent with typical sunset scenes and autumn landscapes, which often feature vibrant, warm colors. I confirm the scene depicted remains as described.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a beige-colored sofa with multiple cushions of similar color, including a noticeable yellow accent pillow among them. Beige is a neutral color that pairs well with other earth tones like the yellow pillow seen here. The contrast and arrangement suggest a continuation of the design theme from Image A.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sofa is visibly placed directly below the framed painting hanging on the wall.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B indicates natural light streaming from the right side, illuminating parts of the sofa and the wall. The presence of shadows and highlights typical of sunlight suggests this method of illumination. This aligns with the architectural design often featuring windows or openings on one side for balanced lighting.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a light floor with a subtle herringbone pattern, continuing the theme from Image A. Herringbone is a classic pattern recognized by its distinctive zigzag design, often used in flooring for its aesthetic appeal and tradition. The consistent pattern suggests that there has been no change in this aspect of the room's d√©cor.",
