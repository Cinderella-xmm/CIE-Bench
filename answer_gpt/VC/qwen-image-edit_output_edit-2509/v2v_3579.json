        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows sushi pieces arranged to form a human-like figure, and several pieces have an orange-pink color and a textured surface typical of salmon used in sushi, which likely represents salmon nigiri.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are several sushi pieces that appear cylindrical with nori (seaweed) wrapping, which are characteristic of maki rolls. The fillings inside the rolls appear in colors such as green (likely cucumber or avocado) and yellow-orange (possibly representing bell peppers or similar ingredients).

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a figure made up of various sushi pieces, several of which have a black seaweed outer layer, known as nori. This is typical of sushi rolls, especially maki, and these pieces have well-defined edges due to the wrapping technique used in their construction.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a clear glass containing water visible and positioned towards the top-left corner of the image frame. This setup would imply that a drink is part of the presentation.",
