      "question": "Does the robot retain its dome-shaped head with three evenly spaced circular porthole eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's head appears dome-shaped, consistent with a traditional steampunk aesthetic, featuring three circular porthole eyes evenly spaced around the upper portion of the head. This observation can be made by identifying the uniform circular shapes arranged around the head, allowing for functionality like visual sensors in robotics. This design remains unchanged from Image A, signifying consistent retention.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the transparent chest panel still present, clearly displaying the internal gear system?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's chest panel remains transparent, revealing intricate gears. This assessment utilizes visual cues of transparency and observable mechanical parts, indicating that its design function is to showcase engineering intricacies. Analysis of Image A confirms this feature, showing continuity between the two images.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do both arms retain their segmented, piston-style joint construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the robot’s arms with segmented constructions reminiscent of pistons, evidenced by regular intervals of separations in the arm's design. Such mechanics imply movement flexibility typical of articulated joints found in steampunk machinery. Comparing with Image A, the segmented structure appears unchanged.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both feet equipped with exactly five claw-like toes each?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each foot of the robot is equipped with five distinctly claw-like appendages. These appendages are evenly distributed and visually resemble claws, which might serve functional or aesthetic purposes in this mechanical entity. Image A reconfirms this feature, showing symmetry and consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there five distinct spires and antennae on top of the robot’s head, including one central and four lateral ones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows five distinct protrusions on the top of the robot's head: one central, likely serving as the primary antenna, and four lateral spires or smaller antennae. Such design often suggests enhanced capabilities for signal reception or style. Image A comparison confirms these features are identical with no alterations.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are multiple interlocking gears of different sizes visible through the transparent chest panel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, through the transparent chest panel, various interlocking gears of differing sizes are visible. This detail speaks to the complexity and function of mechanical movements within, a hallmark of steampunk craftsmanship. Image A also demonstrates this component, showcasing consistency between the images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the robot maintain its original oxidized bronze and copper color scheme with visible wear and aging effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot in Image B continues to exhibit an oxidized bronze and copper color scheme, lending a vintage appearance associated with steampunk style. This is highlighted by the tarnished look and darkened areas, suggesting aging. Image A similarly presents this color scheme and effects, confirming unaltered design aesthetics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Rivets and mechanical fasteners are visibly present along the joints and edges in Image B, indicating structural integrity and assembly methods. These features provide necessary reinforcement and contribute to the steampunk aesthetics. Image A mirrors this construction with discernible rivets and fasteners, affirming their continuity.",
