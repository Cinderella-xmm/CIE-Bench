    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the conical, tiered structure composed of multiple horizontal levels stacked vertically preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure is a flat box in the shape of a triangular Christmas tree and does not feature a tiered, conical design. The first image shows a tiered structure with horizontal levels stacked vertically, whereas in Image B this design is replaced by a flat triangular form, indicating the tiered structure is not preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the teardrop-shaped chocolate droplets positioned at the center of each tier preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not have teardrop-shaped chocolate droplets positioned at the center of tiers. Instead, it shows shaped openings resembling tree sections filled with nuts. Image A displays teardrop-shaped droplets at each tier, suggesting that such a design element is absent in the edited image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the chocolate pinecone-like structures supporting each tier preserved in their original form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no chocolate pinecone-like structures visible. Image A contains such structures supporting each tier, but in Image B, it is replaced with a triangular box without any tier-supporting elements, indicating the chocolate structure is not preserved.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the nuts (including almonds, pecans, and hazelnuts) visibly contained within the teardrop-shaped droplets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, nuts are displayed visibly but are not contained within teardrop-shaped droplets. Image A shows nuts within teardrop-shaped chocolate droplets, whereas Image B presents these nuts within the triangular spaces, indicating this aspect is not preserved.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wide, circular base with a horizontal band at its edge preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a base similar to Image A. Image A has a circular base with a band where the tiers rest, while Image B presents a flat triangular packaging without this structural characteristic.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the overall color scheme dominated by deep brown tones with gold highlights preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains a color scheme with deep brown tones complemented by gold highlights, seen in the packaging design and the nuts inside it. Image A’s structure also features a similar brown and gold theme, suggesting that the color scheme is preserved.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the teardrop-shaped droplets centrally aligned along the vertical axis of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include teardrop-shaped droplets aligned centrally; instead, its design features triangular sections filled with nuts. Image A has central teardrop-shaped clusters aligned vertically, contrasting with Image B’s lack of similar arrangement.",
