      "question": "Is the distinctive golden lattice framework of the Address Downtown tower visible and structurally intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the tower's design is no longer the focus due to the presence of a large futuristic robot, which obscures the view of the buildings. However, the framing and style of elements such as lighting effects that resemble the golden lattice framework could still be recognized in the surroundings, but the structure isn't visible as before. Given that, compared to the original Image A, the focus has shifted significantly.",

      "question": "Is the cylindrical shape and curved top of the Emaar Tower preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of the robot and other futuristic elements dominate the visual field, making it difficult to discern the specific shape and features of the Emaar Tower as seen in Image A. While parts of the skyline structures match Image A, the clarity and distinct characteristics of the Emaar Tower like its cylindrical shape are not prominently visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the Address Downtown tower located to the left of the Emaar Tower in the skyline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the large robotic figure and other artistic modifications, the precise placement of the Address Downtown and Emaar Towers isn't as discernible as in Image A, where the Address Downtown tower is left of Emaar Tower. However, based on alignment with the partial background, it seems the layout remains consistent with the left positioning.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the beige, low-rise buildings with arched windows visible in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus on a towering robot and the futuristic street view detracts from the visibility of the foreground buildings present in Image A. The architecture style of Image Aâ€™s low-rise buildings with arches is not prominent in the finished work due to other design elements.",

      "question": "Is the large building with a green roof and illuminated frontage visible in the midground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, enhancements and artistic alterations affect how structures appear, where the focus is on the robotic figure and futuristic cityscapes. This affects the prominence of midground elements like the green-roofed building visible in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a sky that maintains a consistent dark blue tone reminiscent of Image A, yet it is presented in a modified style that complements the overall futuristic theme, where typical celestial details like stars, and clouds are intentionally absent to maintain aesthetic simplicity.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tallest skyscraper, appearing prominently in Image A with its distinctive glowing apex, undergoes a thematic alteration in Image B. The inclusion of futuristic elements slightly alters but still maintains visibility of its characteristic tapering structure and glowing feature ensconced in creative embellishments.",
