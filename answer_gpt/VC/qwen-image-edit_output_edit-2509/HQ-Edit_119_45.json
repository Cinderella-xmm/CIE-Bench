      "question": "Is the nemes headdress present with its characteristic wide, striped, layered shape covering the head and shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show a headdress with wing-like structures attached on both sides and a central circular gem, which differ significantly from the original nemes headdress known for its wide, striped, layered look that extends down to cover the shoulders. This indicates that Image B does not feature the traditional nemes headdress.",

      "question": "Is the uraeus cobra positioned centrally on the forehead, above the eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the center of the forehead features a large gem, with wing-like and mechanical elements visible. No sign of the traditional uraeus cobra is present in this depiction, suggesting a departure from the original. Therefore, the answer is based on the absence of a cobra motif in the described position.",

    },
    {

      "question": "Is there a false beard extending vertically from the chin, matching the original pleated form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases elaborate mechanical and wing-like extensions around the neck area without showing a beaded false beard extending from underneath the chin, as commonly associated with traditional Egyptian masks.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the eyes almond-shaped and positioned symmetrically beneath thick eyebrows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blurred area hides specific details related to eyes and eyebrows, making it impossible to confirm the distinct almond-shaped eyes and eyebrow features. Consequently, it's not valid to state they appear as described when the facial region is obscured.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays ears on either side of the head with a recognizable human shape, contributing to a symmetrical and balanced design aligning with common human representation of ears.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the collar features more a mechanical and futuristic design, deviating from the traditional horizontal band arrangement associated with the original broad collar style. This suggests a departure from the classic form.",
