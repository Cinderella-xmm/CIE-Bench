      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual representation features two chibi characters with cartoon-like designs, indicating a completely different setting and subject than the original sheep. The image does not display the granular, detailed texture associated with natural wool from sheep.",

      "question": "Do the sheep retain their darker facial and leg markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, featuring stylized, cartoon characters, does not display any natural sheep, hence the specific facial and leg markings associated with sheep are not present in the edited version.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B appears in a completely different context, focusing solely on two cartoon characters in a presumably indoor setting with a sports-related theme, eliminating the grassy field scene.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no elements of a natural outdoor environment, such as tree lines, are present. The focus is on an animated, contained setting with no depiction of nature or external fields.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B involves an illustration of cartoon characters, the natural behaviors of sheep, like grazing or standing, are not depicted. The context and subjects have completely changed, focusing on a different scenario altogether.",
