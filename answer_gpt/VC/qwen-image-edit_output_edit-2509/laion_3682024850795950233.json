      "question": "Does the edited image retain the grainy, porous texture of the whole wheat bread slices?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) features a stylized comic representation rather than a realistic depiction of a sandwich. The visual theme focuses on a cartoon-like figure, identified as 'The Bread Warrior,' with no explicit realistic bread slice textures present. This contrasts with the original image, which visually highlighted the grainy, porous texture typical of whole wheat bread. The edited approach prioritizes a fantasy theme over realistic food depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the context shifts to a fantasy-like comic theme with 'Bread Warrior' and does not represent any actual sandwich ingredients like lettuce leaves. The focus is on character and story elements rather than on preserving realistic vegetable visuals like green lettuce. Thus, the specific green color and leafy shape, as could be seen in the original image, are not depicted in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the main visual focuses on a cartoon figure and his journey, omitting realistic sandwich elements such as a red tomato slice. Despite the original image featuring a classic tomato in a sandwich setup, the cartoon comic theme does not lend itself to depicting these realistic food components.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) has transitioned into a fantasy comic style without incorporating elements like brown serif font text from the original image. The visuals now use a playful, large typography fitting the theme of 'The Saga of the Heroic Bread Warrior,' excluding any previous fonts such as 'AMERICA'S' from Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which focuses on a fantasy comic story, the ribbon-like element associated with a sandwich design in Image A is replaced with other thematic visuals like character design. The shift from a food-related image to a narrative comic theme meant that specific elements like a maroon ribbon banner are not retained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B doesn't carry over the realistic or trademark attributes from Image A, such as the specific trademark symbol next to 'SANDWICH.' The focus has wholly shifted to a graphic comic representation, negating direct textual and legal elements like trademarks present in the sandwich depiction.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image has adopted a comic book style narrative focusing on the 'Bread Warrior' instead of sandwich components or realistic bread visuals from Image A, including 'SANDWICH™' in brown serif font. Therefore, these elements are absent in the edited image.",
