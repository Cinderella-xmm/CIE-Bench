      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the two prominent curved horns on top of the helmet still present and retaining their original shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the helmet of the armored figure still has the two prominent curved horns positioned at the top. They appear to be unchanged in both shape and position compared to typical helmets with similar features. These visual details help in identifying that the horns have been retained as originally intended.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the faceplate still skull-shaped with clearly visible, glowing red eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a helmet, but the faceplate is not visibly skull-shaped, and the eyes are not glowing red. Instead, the face area is blurred. Based on the image, it can be inferred that distinctive features like a skull shape and red glowing eyes are not present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the shoulder pauldrons retain their large, spiked structure and the red vein-like patterns embedded within them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoulder pauldrons appear to maintain their large, spiked structure, and the red vein-like patterns are visible, suggesting continuity in design elements. This analysis is based on the sharp and angular visual elements seen around the shoulders and the recurring red patterns.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the chest armor maintain its segmented, layered design with visible rivets and mechanical joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the chest armor of the figure retaining a segmented, layered design with visible structural elements like rivets and joints. This visual consistency is evident through the detailed texture and construction that suggests a mechanically layered essence.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands of the armored figure continue to exhibit claw-like features, complete with sharp, pointed extensions resembling claws. The visually aggressive design aligns with common imagery of armored warriors with weaponized gloves.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the original weathered and scarred texture of the armor still visible across the chest, shoulders, and limbs?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays an armor texture that appears to be weathered and scarred, indicative of wear and battle. This texture covers the chest, shoulders, and limbs, preserving the original rough and rugged look.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the figure maintain its original silhouette and proportional relationship between head, torso, and limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's silhouette, showing proportionality between head, torso, and limbs, remains consistent with classical armored figures. The visual depiction of balance and proportionate design suggests no major alterations to the overall structure.",
