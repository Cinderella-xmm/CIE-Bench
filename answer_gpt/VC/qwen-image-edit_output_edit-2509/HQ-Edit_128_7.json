    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image preserve the multi-tiered, stepped gable structure of the church, with at least three distinct roof levels stacked vertically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure is still multi-tiered, which is evident as it maintains several roof levels despite the addition of crystal-like elements and glowing planets. The tiered structure, typical of such buildings, is in line with its original purpose and style, clearly visible beneath the magical additions.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible carved wooden patterns along the eaves and gables of the church, even if overlaid with glowing runes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows decorative glowing runes overlaying the wooden surfaces. However, the emphasis on glowing elements diminishes the clarity of carved wooden patterns, making them less noticeable or possibly not visually present at all.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cross-shaped finial still present at the very top of the central spire, even if partially obscured by glowing celestial orbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top of the central spire in Image B features glowing elements like celestial orbs rather than a cross-shaped finial. The original finial may have been replaced or entirely obscured by the magical additions, making it invisible.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there horn-like or antler-shaped projections extending from the corners of the roof sections, especially at the top tiers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, these projections are absent, likely replaced by or obscured by the crystal formations at the roof corners. These magical elements change the distinctive architectural silhouette, making such features nonexistent.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a stone-paved pathway leading directly from the foreground to the main entrance of the church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains a stone-paved pathway, connecting the foreground to the church's entrance, preserved amidst the addition of atmospheric elements like mist and runes. Despite fantastical changes, this pathway is unchanged and visible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a clearly defined arched doorway located at the center of the front facade, accessible via a short flight of steps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) retains the arched doorway with the immediate visual of steps leading to it, even though the church's surface is overlaid with mystical elements. The accessible pathway remains unchanged by fantasy overlays.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there evergreen trees with snow on their branches and clusters of pink or purple flowering shrubs in the immediate foreground around the church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fantastical elements in Image B have altered or obscured the immediate surroundings, leading to changes in foliage. Now, swirling cloud-like elements and mystically tinted foliage predominate, replacing prior distinct plant life.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are snow-covered mountains visible in the background behind the church, with a body of water situated between the church and the mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains snowy mountains in the background, with a body of water still present between the church and mountains, unchanged despite mystical alterations. The landscape situation remains consistent in the transformation.",
