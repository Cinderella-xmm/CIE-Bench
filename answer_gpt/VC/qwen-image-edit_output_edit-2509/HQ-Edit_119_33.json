      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the subject's skin tone appears to be a rich, dark brown. This is visible in the areas not obscured by blur, such as her arms and shoulders. Combining visual information and common understanding of color palettes in art, the skin tone aligns with dark tones typically seen in people of African descent.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual observation reveals sunflowers incorporated into the subject's hair. These sunflowers are distinguishable by their characteristic yellow petals and green central disk, a common depiction of sunflowers in art.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the subject wearing a dress with visible shades of yellow. Given that sunflowers and the subject's overall attire consist of earthy tones, the dress appears predominantly yellow, consistent with visual indicators and awareness of color schemes.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the subject's head is turned slightly to the right, as evidenced by the angle of her shoulder and the orientation of her hair. This can be discerned through understanding perspective and anatomy in portraiture.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is filled with a large number of sunflower blooms, suggesting the setting is a sunflower field. The presence of numerous sunflowers and the landscape orientation support this deduction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's lighting reveals brighter highlights on the subject's shoulders and the sunflowers at her upper left, while the shadows fall towards the bottom left. This implies the light source direction is from the upper right, aligning with understanding of shadow and light behavior.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B reveals that the subject's facial area is blurred, making it impossible to verify a visible smile or presence of teeth. Therefore, based on available information, her dental expression cannot be confirmed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
