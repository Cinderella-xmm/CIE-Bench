      "question": "Does the edited image retain the airplane's wings, engines, and tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the airplane has been transformed into a cartoonish, anthropomorphic depiction with visible wings, engines, and tail. The airplane has a playful design, featuring a face on its front and decorations such as a dragon pattern. Despite these changes, the fundamental elements of an airplane—the wings, engines, and tail—are still present. This transformation is purely stylistic, turning the plane into a character without eliminating its essential components needed to identify it as an airplane.",

      "question": "Is the airplane still positioned on the runway in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cartoon airplane positioned on what appears to be a runway, similar to an airport setting. The background and its alignment indicate that the plane is on a flat surface typical of runways. This placement retains consistency with real-world scenarios where aircrafts are situated on runways for takeoff and landing.",

      "question": "Does the edited image still feature a golden sunset background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) maintains a background with a warm, golden hue, suggesting a sunset scene. This typical sunset color palette creates a similar atmospheric condition as seen in Image A, where the golden sunset provides a consistent ambiance across both images.",

      "question": "Are the runway markings (\"10\" and guiding lines) still visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the runway markings including the number '10' and related guiding lines are visible beneath the cartoon airplane. These markings are critical for aircraft navigation and are commonly present on runways. Despite the artistic edits, these essential details remain unchanged, reflecting their role in real-world aviation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the horizon line appears softer and less distinct compared to the original. While the overall setting remains an open, expansive space, the specific detail of distant tree silhouettes is less defined than in Image A, possibly due to the focus on the cartoon airplane and its surrounding elements, such as the decorative lanterns.",
