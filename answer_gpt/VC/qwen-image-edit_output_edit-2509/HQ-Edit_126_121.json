      "question": "Are the gorilla’s eyes golden-yellow in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial region of the gorilla, including its eyes, is covered and blurred out. Due to this, no specific discernment can be made regarding the color of the gorilla's eyes. As we can't observe the eyes' color to determine if they are golden-yellow, the correct choice is based on the inability to confirm such a detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a prominent silver-colored crest on the top of the gorilla’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows the gorilla with its facial features obscured, but the outline and texture of its fur are visible. A silverback gorilla's crest is usually characterized by a prominent silver color, which is not distinctly observed in Image B as only part of the head is visible without specific coloration details. It mainly shows the gorilla's dense, dark fur without evidence of a silver-colored crest.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the banana bunch composed of multiple yellow bananas curving outward from a common stem?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla is shown holding a bunch of bananas which appear to be yellow and are curving outward from a single common stem. This arrangement is typical and can be recognized as a characteristic bunch of bananas.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both of the gorilla’s hands actively holding the banana bunch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B indicate that both of the gorilla's arms are positioned around the banana bunch, suggesting that both hands are involved in holding it. This is a common stance for a gorilla to securely hold an object.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the gorilla have thick, dark fur with visible texture and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla's fur is shown with detailed texture and depth, appearing thick and dark. This portrayal aligns with the typical characteristics of gorilla fur, which is usually dense and of a dark hue.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the gorilla facing directly forward, making eye contact with the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gorilla's face in Image B is obscured; thus, it's impossible to ascertain its direct facing orientation or eye contact with viewers. The absence of visible eyes due to the blur makes it impossible to conclude that the gorilla is making eye contact or facing forward.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the bananas have visible brown spots and slight blemishes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon closely observing the bananas in Image B, they are depicted with some brown spots and slight blemishes, which are typical for ripe bananas. These visual details are a common occurrence and help in assessing the bananas' ripeness.",
