      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake is depicted with a grid of rounded domes that resemble a whimsical character, suggesting the surface of the cake is designed with similar rounded features. However, it is clear these domes are not yellow, nor does it specifically detail the presence of a grid but rather a singular circular domed character. Hence, the character does not imply a grid of domes as seen in Image A.",
