    "Question": "Q1: Is the red velvet cushion with visible quilted texture present beneath the saxophone?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object placed on the cushion is a serpent, not a saxophone. The cushion beneath the serpent is indeed a red velvet cushion with a visible quilted texture.

    "Question": "Q3: Is the lighting source positioned above the saxophone, creating a bright central glow that fades into darkness toward the edges of the frame?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a similar lighting setup to Image A, with the serpent instead of a saxophone. The lighting source is above, creating a spotlight effect. This results in a bright central area directly on the object (serpent) and fades into darkness as it moves away from the center, typical of cinematic lighting.",
