    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the Coca-Cola bottle present in the advertisement with its distinctive curved shape and visible partial logo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show a backdrop that resembles a stylized comic noir setting, likely intended as a parody or fictional situation. The overall design is different from a traditional advertisement, suggesting the absence of any soda bottle. Given these observations, the distinctive bottle shape and logo seen in typical advertisements are not apparent here.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the white earbud visible in the woman’s ear with the wire extending downward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a noir-themed illustration with a focus on a man amidst dark cityscapes absent any earbud details as would be present in realistic photography. Thus, no earbud can be identified.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are both the man and the woman shown in profile, facing to the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, the artistic presentation includes only one main character prominently positioned as if reading, typical in noir settings without depicting multiple individuals side-by-side. Thus, the concept of two figures facing the same direction can be ruled out.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the man’s right hand positioned near his ear, holding the earbud in a manner that mimics the woman’s use?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the noir illustration captures the man holding an object within the setting of intrigue or investigation typical of noir imagery. The absence of earbuds suggests a different item or gesture rather than mimicking earbud usage.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the top-right corner of the advertisement visibly torn or peeling, revealing the underlying surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show typical advertising settings but utilizes noir aesthetics, lacking advertisement features such as torn corners in printed ads.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the man positioned in front of the advertisement, partially overlapping it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The setting in Image B portrays the man seated at a table with noir imagery instead of an advertisement backdrop present in Image A, leading away from the scene of overlapping elements.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the word \"Coca\" or \"Coca-Cola\" legible on the bottle in the advertisement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, capturing a noir theme, excludes standard commercial elements like branding on bottles that would appear in typical advertisements.",
