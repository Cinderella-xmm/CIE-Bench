      "question": "Does the image retain the baby elephant's wrinkled gray skin texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a baby elephant at all. Instead, it shows a plated dish that resembles floral patterns created with carrot slices and a rolled piece of meat. Since there is no depiction of an elephant or any animal skin texture in Image B, the question about retaining the baby elephant's skin texture is inapplicable.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of a baby elephant. The entire scene is composed of a plate with arranged food items resembling a flower. As such, the specific detail about the baby elephant's ear size relative to its body does not pertain to Image B.",

      "question": "Does the baby elephant retain a short trunk in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display a baby elephant; it contains a plated dish presented artistically. Hence, the characteristic of a baby elephant having a short trunk is not present in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a plate of food artfully arranged on what seems to be a plain surface and does not include any structures like vertical blue metal bars. Therefore, these bars are not present in Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's background appears to be a textured surface that might mimic dirt, but it does not distinctly resemble the reddish dirt as seen in Image A. The emphasis in Image B is on the artistic presentation of the dish, not on the ground texture.",
