      "question": "Does the image retain the tan leather texture and black stitching on the glove?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, various views of the baseball glove are depicted, including detailed technical illustrations. The color and texture seem to be maintained in some visuals, particularly the top-left view that showcases a realistic tan leather with black stitching. Technical illustrations usually display true-to-life design and structure, emphasizing authentic features such as texture and stitching.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the baseball depicted in white with visible red stitching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains technical illustrations that focus on the glove, with no realistic depiction of the baseball. Instead, the focus is on detailed schematics of the baseball glove. Therefore, there is no visual depiction of a baseball that matches the description of white with red stitching.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the top, side, and sectional views of the glove and ball preserving their respective 3D shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes illustrations showing different views of the glove such as frontal and side sections, capturing the 3D structure of the glove through drawing techniques. However, the baseball itself is absent from these illustrations, which focus solely on the glove.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the views show the baseball and glove in a way that clearly depicts their association as sports equipment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is composed of technical sketches that display different angles and components of the glove. While these visualizations identify the glove as sports equipment through design labels and structural elements, there is no depiction of the baseball, which impairs a direct association between the glove and baseball as sports equipment.",

      "question": "Does the image include a hint of a grass-like texture under the glove in at least one view?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustrations in Image B are composed entirely of technical sketches and lack any background or environmental context, such as grass textures. These illustrations are focused on the structural diagrams of the baseball glove and do not include environmental textures.",
