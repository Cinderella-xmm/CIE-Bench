      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there exactly one tree positioned in the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree is the most prominent feature and is directly in the center of the image. Its symmetrical placement relative to the other visual elements confirms that there is one tree positioned centrally. Common sense tells us that when objects are centrally placed, they draw focus to themselves as the main subject of the image, which is true here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the tree have a clearly defined layered canopy structure with multiple horizontal tiers of foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree's foliage does appear to be distributed in horizontal layers or tiers, which visually suggests a canopy structure. The tree is drawn with particular attention given to the layering effects, making them prominent. This matches the expectation of a tiered canopy structure often seen in certain tree species.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the tree positioned in front of the mountain range in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a tree in the foreground with mountains visible as background elements. The tree is clearly in front, with the mountains positioned behind it. This spatial arrangement is a common artistic technique used to create depth in images by layering objects and placing detailed foreground subjects with broader background landscapes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible shadow extending from the base of the tree onto the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a shadow visible extending from the base of the tree onto the ground. This is indicated by the darker area projected directly downward from the base. Shadows are frequently used in art to convey lighting direction and add realism to the scene.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a flat grassy plain beneath the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The area beneath the tree in Image B appears to be a grassy plain. The smoothness and horizontal nature of the lines suggest a flat surface, and the green color typically signifies grass or a similar terrain. This is consistent with depictions of plains, which are flat stretches of land.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there mountains visible in the background behind the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, mountains are clearly identifiable in the background behind the tree. Their triangular shapes and varied sizes align with common representations of mountain ranges, which are often used in artistic compositions to create depth and scenic landscapes.",
