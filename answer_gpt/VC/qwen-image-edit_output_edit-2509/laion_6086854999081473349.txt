    "Question": "Q1: Are the two garage doors positioned side by side on the lower front portion of the cabin, directly beneath the large upper window section?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the region corresponding to where garage doors would typically be located on a cabin has been transformed into circular, glowing green portals with mystical engravings and is not a traditional structure with visible garage doors. Therefore, the two garage doors positioned side by side as in a traditional cabin structure, as they are in Image A, are not depicted in Image B.",
