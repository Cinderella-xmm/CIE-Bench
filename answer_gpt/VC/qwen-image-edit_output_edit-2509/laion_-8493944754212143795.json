      "question": "Is there visible sunlight reflecting off the water surface, creating bright sparkles and highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of a mystical dragon with glowing blue scales and markings takes center stage, drawing attention away from any direct observation of sunlight effects on the water surface. However, some reflective properties are artistically replicated to give an impression of the scene's original lighting, though it does not directly display natural sunlight effects as seen in Image A. The edited image focuses more on the fantasy elements rather than the natural reflections.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible patches of green moss or algae on the rock surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon dominates the visual content, with its size and colors taking a prominent place. Although there might be a subtle suggestion of green, the focus on fantasy and mythical elements indicates that any natural details like green moss or algae from the original are unlikely to be visible or emphasized. The attention is towards enhancing the mythical narrative.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there white, foamy water at the base of the cascade and along the edges of the flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the digital art nature replaces some of the natural water details with creative imagery. While the water effect is present for context and interaction with the dragon, it doesn’t exhibit the detailed foamy white water from the original. Instead, artistic cloud-like elements are used, which deviate from the natural foamy water.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the rocks exhibit a layered, stepped formation with visible cracks and erosion lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's fantastical setting means that while some aspects of the original rocks persist to serve as a backdrop, they aren’t the focal point and the details such as cracks or erosion are not prominently visible beyond creating an interesting setting for the dragon. Thus, natural erosion and detailed rock layering are minimized.",
      "weight": 2,

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the water flow downward from the upper part of the image toward the lower part?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon integrates into the scenery, and while there is some indication of water flow, the mystical scene places emphasis on aesthetic integration rather than accurate depiction of natural phenomena, such as the directional flow of water. The water interaction appears stylized rather than literal.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a clear contrast between the dark, wet rock surfaces and the bright, fast-moving water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, dominated by the fantastical elements like the glowing and dynamic depiction of the dragon, does not maintain a clear and natural contrast as observed in a real setting. The focus is on harmonizing colors and forms to create a magical experience rather than depicting a real contrast.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the imaginative setting of Image B, the space above the water is occupied by fantasy elements, such as smoke or mist associated with the dragon's magical aura, rather than realistic water mist or droplets. These effects are stylized for thematic purposes rather than representing actual water behavior.",
