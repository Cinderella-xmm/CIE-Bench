      "question": "Are the two elongated sausage-shaped forms positioned on the left side of the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the representation is a mosaic pattern, where there are elongated sausage-shaped forms depicted in red-orange tiles. These forms are positioned to the left of the central area of the image, similar to how sausages would typically be positioned on the left side of a plate. Therefore, in the context of the mosaic representing a plate, the sausages are on the left.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a circular form with a central orange-yellow disc representing the egg yolk located in the lower right quadrant of the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the circular form with a yellow center is a depiction of an egg, with the central orange-yellow discs representing egg yolks. These forms are located in the lower right quadrant of the image, aligning with typical plate arrangements where an egg might be positioned.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a cluster of green and red elements in the upper right portion of the plate representing the salad?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a mosaic with green and red elements in the upper portion of the image. The green elements may represent leaves, and the red elements could be cherry tomatoes, combining to symbolize a salad. Their position towards the upper section can be interpreted as being in the upper right of the plate.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the meal arranged on a circular gray plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a mosaic art style without depicting the actual plate; thus, it does not clearly show a circular gray plate as seen in common meals served on dishware. The mosaicked arrangement appears to suggest a static piece of art rather than an actual plate.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sausages on the left, the egg in the lower right, and the salad in the upper right of the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual layout in Image B suggests a balanced distribution similar to that of a real plate: elongated forms on the left, circular forms with yellow centers (eggs) on the lower right, and colorful elements suggested as a salad at the top. These positions relate well to how meals are often organized on plates.",
      "weight": 2,

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there distinct red circular elements interspersed among the green elements in the salad cluster?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, among the mosaic's green elements, there are red circular elements integrated among them. These could imply items such as cherry tomatoes scattered among salad leaves, fitting the typical visual representation of a salad.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there thin green linear elements (rosemary) placed along the sausages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not provide intricate details like thin linear elements such as rosemary placed along the sausages due to its mosaic nature. Since it's represented decoratively, typical fine elements like scattered rosemary are not discernible.",
