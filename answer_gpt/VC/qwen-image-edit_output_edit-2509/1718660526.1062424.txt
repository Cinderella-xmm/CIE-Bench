    "Question": "Q1: Are the black stripes evenly distributed across the body, head, and legs in the same pattern as the original knitted animal?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the animal features a mosaic pattern, where the black stripes are visible but not identical to the knitted texture of Image A. The stripes in Image B are created using small square tiles, and while they are distributed across the body, head, and legs, the pattern may differ due to the mosaic style. In Image A, the stripes are part of the knitted fabric. Therefore, although both images feature stripes, the pattern differs based on the texture and style used.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the snout present with two clearly defined, dark circular nostrils positioned symmetrically on the upper portion of the snout?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snout of the mosaic animal lacks clearly defined circular nostrils. The mosaic tiles create a uniform surface without specific features like nostrils. Conversely, Image A, the knitted animal, has two circular nostrils that are prominent and dark, creating a more natural-looking snout detail.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the eyes large, round, and positioned symmetrically on the face, each consisting of a white outer ring and a central black pupil?",
    "explanation": "Both images feature large, round eyes that are positioned symmetrically on the face, each with a white outer ring and a central black pupil. Image B displays these features using a mosaic tile pattern, while Image A shows them as part of the knitted fabric.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the mouth a clearly visible curved line forming a smile below the snout, consistent with the original animalâ€™s expression?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mouth is represented as a curved line formed by the mosaic pattern, maintaining a smiling expression. This is consistent with Image A, where the knitted texture shows a similar smiling mouth below the snout. Both images depict a friendly, smiling animal expression.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the animal in a walking pose with the left front leg extended forward and the right front leg grounded behind it?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the mosaic animal with its legs firmly in place on a base, suggesting a static pose rather than a walking one. This contrasts with Image A, where the knitted animal is depicted in a walking pose, with the left front leg extended forward and the right front leg grounded behind it.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there two small, rounded ears positioned symmetrically on top of the head, pointing slightly outward?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the animal has two small, round ears positioned symmetrically on top of the head, as seen in the mosaic design. Similarly, Image A showcases these ears as part of the knitted fabric, maintaining their symmetrical placement and outward orientation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the sculpture placed on a surface with a visibly granular, uneven texture resembling natural sand?",
    "explanation": "Image B features the mosaic animal placed on a surface that resembles a base with tiles or patterns, lacking the natural sand texture. Image A is depicted on what appears to be a natural sandy beach with granular texture, highlighting the difference in setting between the knitted and mosaic versions.",
    "answer": "No"
