      "question": "Is the violin clearly present under the woman’s chin, held by her left hand, with the bow drawn across the strings by her right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the violin is clearly visible under the woman’s chin, a common position for playing the instrument.

      "question": "Are both arms positioned correctly to support violin playing—left arm holding the instrument, right arm moving the bow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In this image, the left arm is holding the neck of the violin, supporting it under the chin, while the right arm is seen drawing the bow across the strings. This mirrors the traditional stance for playing a violin, where the left arm handles the violin's position and note playing, and the right arm manages the movement of the bow to create sound.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since we are excluding the part about the blurred face, we cannot ascertain the state of her eyes or specific facial expression. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately conclude any facial expression, including whether her eyes are open or closed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the woman in an upright posture, with her body facing slightly toward the viewer. The stance is often adopted to maintain balance while holding the violin, ensuring stability during the performance. This position aligns well with typical violin-playing postures where the player slightly angles toward the audience for better sound projection.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In reviewing Image B, the bow is seen extending across the strings of the violin. This contact is essential for sound production when playing the violin, and the positioning in the image supports the action of bowing the strings of the instrument.",
