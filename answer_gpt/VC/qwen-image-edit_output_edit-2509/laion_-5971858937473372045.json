      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are three distinct figures, each wearing different gowns and positioned in the frame, indicating that there are exactly three women present. This conclusion is drawn from observing the attire and positioning of the figures outlined in the image.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
