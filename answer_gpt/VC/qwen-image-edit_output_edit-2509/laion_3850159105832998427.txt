    "Question": "Q1: Is the 'Gibson' logo in gold script visible on the headstock?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the headstock is connected to the dragon's neck and is partially obscured by flames and the dragon's body. The details of the headstock, including any potential logo, are not visible due to this obstruction. Typically, a 'Gibson' logo would be found at the top of the headstock, but in this case, it cannot be seen. Based on this analysis of Image B alone, the 'Gibson' logo is not visible.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are there exactly six fiery tendrils extending from the bridge to the headstock area?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar features flames around it, but counting precise, distinct fiery tendrils is challenging due to the overlapping flames and the integration with the dragon imagery. Generally, fiery tendrils in such an illustration blend visually, making it difficult to count distinct entities. Therefore, without clear visual separations, the image does not distinctly show six separate tendrils.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the guitar oriented vertically with the neck pointing upward?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a guitar integrated into a dragon illustration. The guitar is positioned such that the neck of the guitar appears to extend vertically upward. The orientation of the guitar, despite the addition of flames and dragon features, adheres to a typical vertical alignment with the neck leading upward, away from the body of the guitar.",
    "answer": "Yes"
