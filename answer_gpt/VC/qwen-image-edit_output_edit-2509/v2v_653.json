      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all six chibi-style stickers feature characters that appear to be wearing lab coats. The lab coat is a common representation of a scientific or laboratory character.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stickers show characters with a noticeable shirt-like garment under the lab coat. While the stickers are in a chibi style and may not provide very detailed coloring, there is a consistent tinge of a lighter color beneath the lab coat in all stickers, resembling a shirt. This is reminiscent of the subject's attire in Image A where a light blue shirt is visible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style characters do not visibly show a beard. Chibi art often excludes certain facial details like beards for stylistic and space reasons. Since thereâ€™s no visible depiction of facial hair in these characters, it's likely they are meant to be clean-shaven.",
