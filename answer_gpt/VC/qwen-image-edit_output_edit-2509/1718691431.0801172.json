        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mask features two upright, pointed ears. These ears have a black outer edge and display a pinkish-red inner pattern, matching the description provided in the question. This indicates that the visual cues align with the specified characteristics.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the human eyes clearly visible through the eye openings in the mask?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eye area of the mask is obscured and does not allow a clear view of human eyes through the openings. This suggests that the design or editing does not emphasize transparency or visibility at the eye region.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono appears without the horizontal sash or obi being visibly present across the chest area. The obi is generally distinguishable as a band around the waist, but it is not seen in the described position in this image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mask design does not distinctly showcase a centrally-positioned small black oval nose with a faint mouth line. The focus appears more on mask aesthetics rather than these specific facial features.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the overall composition symmetrically balanced along the vertical axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image's elements, including the mask design and kimono, appear to be symmetrically aligned along the vertical axis in Image B. This symmetry is a common feature for artistic designs and garments like the kimono, which is evident here.",
