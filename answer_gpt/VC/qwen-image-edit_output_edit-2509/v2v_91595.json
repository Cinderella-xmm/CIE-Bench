      "question": "Is the \"Nikon\" logo clearly visible on the top of the camera body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, an owl has taken the place of the upper portion of the camera body, and the head is where the top of the camera would typically be. Thus, it obscures the area where the 'Nikon' logo would usually be found. Therefore, based on the editing, the logo is not visible in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the \"Nikon D800\" text visible on the back label of the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area where the 'Nikon D800' text would normally appear is replaced with metallic gears inside the camera body, not leaving room for the text that would typically be there. Thus, the 'Nikon D800' text is not visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the battery compartment door open and hinged on the left side of the camera body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows an open compartment on the left side of the camera body, similar to Image A. This suggests the door is indeed hinged on that side.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the orange plastic tab visible inside the battery compartment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon looking into the battery compartment area, the inside appears to be replaced with mechanical gears and components. There is no orange plastic tab visible within this new context.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Is the black EN-EL3e battery partially inserted into the battery compartment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a battery near the bottom right of the battery compartment, visually consistent in shape and color with a typical EN-EL3e battery, positioned in a way that it is not fully inserted into the compartment. This matches the expected description of a partially inserted battery.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {

      "question": "Does the camera body retain a matte black finish across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the portions of the camera body that are visible maintain a black finish similar to a typical camera. However, large portions of the camera are replaced with metallic components such as gears, and an owl's head, indicating that not the entire surface area retains a matte black finish.",
      "weight": 1,

      "question": "Is the textured rubber grip visible on the handgrip of the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A textured rubber grip appears on the handgrip area of the camera in Image B, similar to standard DSLR camera design where this feature is prominent for easy handling.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the silver metallic ring of the lens mount visible and centered on the front of the camera body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front most part of the camera is replaced with the owl's head and the camera body, which would typically include the lens mount, is not fully visible. As a result, the silver metallic ring around the lens mount is neither visible nor centered as it would traditionally be.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the space where the label with 'MADE IN JAPAN' and the serial number would normally appear is obscured by metallic gears, which results in the label not being visible.",
