      "question": "Does the boot retain the same shape and arrangement of the elongated oval cutouts on the side panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boot features elongated oval cutouts on the side panels. These cutouts are highly distinct in their arrangement and appearance, providing a consistent design element typically found in hiking boots for both aesthetics and ventilation. In Image A, the boot also displays these elongated oval cutouts on the side panels. By comparing these elements, both images exhibit these cutouts in the same shape and arrangement. This consistency suggests the design was retained between both images.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the eyelets positioned in the same vertical alignment and spacing as in the original boot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyelets are aligned vertically, typical of most hiking boots, providing even distribution for lace tension when fastened. Analyzing Image A, the vertical alignment and spacing of the eyelets also follow this pattern. By examining both images in detail, the position and spacing of the eyelets appear identical, suggesting no change occurred between the original and the edited image.",

      "question": "Does the outsole retain the exact tread pattern and groove depth as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tread pattern in Image B's outsole is visible, with pronounced grooves contributing to traction — a key characteristic of hiking boots. Image A shows a similar tread pattern and groove depth. A detailed examination reveals that while the overall tread design appears to follow the same conceptual style, the precise pattern and depth do not align exactly between the two images. Such nuanced differences in detailing suggest variation in execution.",

      "question": "Is the toe cap present and shaped identically to the original, including its rounded front and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B highlights a toe cap with a rounded front, positioned at the forefront of the boot, a common design for added durability and protection in hiking boots. In comparing with Image A, the toe cap also presents these characteristics. Observing both images, the toe cap in both cases maintains the same general shape, position, and rounded appearance, suggesting it has been preserved accurately.",

      "question": "Is the padded collar at the top of the boot preserved in shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The padded collar in Image B is visible at the top of the boot, providing comfort and ankle support, essential for trekking footwear. Examining Image A reveals similar characteristics — a consistent shape and positioning of the collar. In comparing the two images, the padded collar's details match, indicating the design aspect has been preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the boot positioned in the same side profile with the same forward tilt as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In considering Image B, the boot is positioned with a side profile, accentuating its shape and design elements. Reviewing Image A, the same side profile with forward tilt is noted. By aligning these observations, the consistent orientation and tilt affirm that the boot's positional representation is indeed preserved between the images.",

      "question": "Is the tongue of the boot visible and shaped similarly to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the boot's tongue, projecting from behind the lacing system, an important feature for comfort and to prevent debris entry. Image A similarly displays this feature. By examining these visual elements, the shape and visibility of the tongue appear consistent, indicating similarity between the two images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image B and Image A exhibit a heel counter, a critical component for foot stability in hiking boots. Analyzing the design, Image B’s heel counter mirrors the shape and design seen in Image A. The consistent shape and positioning of this key element suggest that the heel counter appearance is identically preserved in both images.",
