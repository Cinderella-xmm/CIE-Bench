      "question": "Is the blue car in the upper left position still rendered in blue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus has shifted to the cereal box and characters, with the car carrier visible in the background. The blue car that was originally in the upper left position in Image A isn't visible in Image B. Therefore, I can't definitively say it is still rendered in blue.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the red car in the upper middle position retain the compact sedan body shape with a sloped roofline and four doors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red car in the upper position of the car carrier is partially visible in the background. The car retains the compact sedan body shape, with a sloped roofline. However, due to the angle and partial visibility, it's unclear if it still has four doors.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there exactly eight cars depicted in the final image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, only parts of the car carrier with fewer visible cars are present due to the focus of the image shifting to the cereal box and characters. Consequently, not all eight cars are depicted in the image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the yellow car located in the upper middle-right position still yellow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The focus on Image B does not prominently show the yellow car as the scene predominantly features the cereal box and animated characters with limited visibility of the cars on the trailer. Thus, it's inconclusive to determine if the yellow car keeps its color since that part of the trailer isn't properly shown.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Does each car have four wheels, with two at the front and two at the rear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cars are not the focal point, and full visibility of all cars is blocked, especially with emphasis on the cereal box and characters. However, based on typical car design and considering the bits of the cars that are visible, it is reasonable to conclude that each car retains the standard configuration of four wheels.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red car at the lower right position is partially visible. Its color still appears red, and it retains the general compact sedan shape. The partial visibility aligns with the original shape and color evident in Image A.",
