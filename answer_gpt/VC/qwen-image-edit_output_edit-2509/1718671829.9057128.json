      "question": "Is there a bench positioned on the left side of the porch, facing inward toward the cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the representation is a stylized art deco illustration, and due to its artistic nature, it lacks realistic features and details such as a bench on the porch. The focus is on the geometric and decorative elements, so there is no bench visible in such illustrations.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays an art deco style facade that focuses on symmetry and decorative geometric patterns. It predominantly features abstract shapes and symbolic representations rather than realistic architectural elements like glass panels or sliding doors emitting warm light.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is adorned with an artistic sun motif rather than a realistic depiction of a moon or a night scene. The sun is central in the composition, radiating lines outward, differing from a moon scenario positioned on the right.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
