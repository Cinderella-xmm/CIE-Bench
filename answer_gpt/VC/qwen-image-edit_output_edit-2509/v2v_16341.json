        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child is shown in an animated pose with one foot raised, creating splashes as they move forward. This indicates playful interaction with the water.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the couple is depicted holding each other closely, with the woman's arms around the man's neck and the man's hands around her waist. Their posture suggests an intimate and possibly dance-like engagement. The closeness and positioning of their bodies are reminiscent of dancing or a romantic embrace.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The older man in Image B is depicted standing upright in the background, with the cane clearly visible in his hand. His posture is stationary, and the cane is positioned in a way that suggests it is being used as a support, typical for someone perhaps needing assistance while standing.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is holding an umbrella and walking closely behind the child. Her proximity and the careful positioning of the umbrella overhead suggest she is providing shelter from the elements, maintaining a protective role as she stays near the child.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurred editing prevents a clear assessment of facial expressions in Image B. Since facial expressions are crucial for determining emotions like smiles or laughter, and these are obscured, it is impossible to definitively affirm if they retain any original expressions.",
