      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure depicted is a toy-like depiction of a gorilla, known as a 'Funko Pop' figure.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a Funko Pop figure, which is characterized by its cartoonish style with minimal body detail. The figure does not exhibit any muscular chest or pectoral definition due to the simplistic design, which is a common trait in such stylized toys.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Funko Pop figure in Image B is depicted in a uniform dark color without any lighter areas on its back and shoulders. The concept of a 'silverback' is not represented due to the uniformity in color of the toy's design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a toy representation with simplified features which include a flat nose, but as a stylized figure, prominent brow ridges typical of gorillas are not distinctly represented due to the minimalistic and cartoonish design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The toy figure in Image B has its hands by its sides while holding a staff, rather than placed on its chest. The toy does not mimic the typical dominant chest-beating pose often associated with gorillas, focusing instead on a more neutral pose holding an object.",
