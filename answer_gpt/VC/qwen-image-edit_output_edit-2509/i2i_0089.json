        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the kitten presents with orange fur adorned with distinctive white markings.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image clearly shows the kitten's eyes, which appear to have a greenish-yellow hue. This is a common eye color in cats and is consistent with the description of the original image. Therefore, it can be deduced that the edited image preserves the kitten's greenish-yellow eyes.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the kitten features prominently perked ears, a noticeable pink nose, and white whiskers. These specific details are observed in the kitten's facial features, suggesting that the edited image maintains these characteristics.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image displays a blue blanket with a visually soft, textured appearance surrounding the kitten. The texture and color are consistent with what one might expect from a soft fabric, indicating that the edited image retains the blue blanket with its soft texture.",

      "question": "Does the kitten retain its relaxed posture while appearing to leap out of the screen in 3D?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the kitten is captured in an active posture, with its body positioned as if leaping forward, creating a 3D effect that gives the impression of movement out of the screen. Unlike a relaxed posture which would typically have the kitten resting or reclining, this posture demonstrates dynamic motion, meaning the image no longer retains the kitten's relaxed posture.",
