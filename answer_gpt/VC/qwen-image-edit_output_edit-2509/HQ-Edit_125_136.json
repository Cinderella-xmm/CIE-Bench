      "question": "Is the American flag patch present on the right shoulder of the astronaut?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut is illustrated in a cartoon-like manner. The right shoulder of the astronaut features a patch that resembles the American flag, identifiable by the red and white stripes and the blue section with stars, which are commonly associated with the flag of the United States.",

      "question": "Is the blue NASA insignia patch visible on the left shoulder of the astronaut?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut's design is stylized, and the left shoulder has a patch, but upon close examination, there is no visible insignia that matches the typical NASA logo. The patch appears to be a simple circle without any additional design that would indicate the presence of the NASA emblem, which usually features lettering and design elements.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is Earth visible in the reflection within the astronaut’s helmet visor, appearing above the lunar horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses cartoons to convey the astronaut's dynamics and does not include realistic reflections in the helmet visor. Instead, it shows a schematic depiction of steps involving astronaut and space station dynamics without any detailed vista reflections that can be identified as Earth or the lunar horizon.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the International Space Station visible in the background with its solar panels and modular structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the schematic illustration shows a representation of a space station with solar panel-like structures in the background, which represent a generalized image of a space station. However, it is not a detailed or specific depiction of the International Space Station, which would have recognizable modular structures and detailed solar arrays.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the ground beneath the astronaut visibly cratered and gray, consistent with the Moon’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature any ground beneath the astronaut that resembles a lunar surface. Instead, it is a stylized backdrop used to illustrate the dynamics involved with astronauts and space stations, without real-world ground textures or craters.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the astronaut facing forward with both side lights on the helmet illuminated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut is depicted as facing forward in the illustration. However, this stylized cartoon representation does not include illuminated side helmet lights, nor does it focus on such detailed elements, as the image's purpose is educational dynamics rather than realistic portrayal.",
