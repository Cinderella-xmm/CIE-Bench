        "Yes",
        "No"

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues indicate that two cylindrical corner towers are present at the left and right ends of the castle.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the castle's construction appears more stylized and less based on dark gray and reddish-brown stone blocks. The stylized depiction within the snow globe does not emphasize the natural tones typical of stonework but rather presents a fantastical, colorful interpretation.",

This shows that the castle's ongoing open-to-the-elements nature is retained in the edited image.",
