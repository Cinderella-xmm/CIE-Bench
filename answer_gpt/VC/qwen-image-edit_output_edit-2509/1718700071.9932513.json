        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a blurred area where the face was originally visible. Despite the lack of clear facial details such as the eyes, nose, mouth, and beard, it's evident that these facial features have been intentionally obscured and are not visible in the edited image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the subject in a seated pose similar to the original, with hands resting palms-up on the thighs. This consistent posture indicates no alteration in the pose between the original and edited versions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, while the headdress is visible, the central diamond motif of the headdress is not discernible due to the blurring effect. It appears that the motif is either absent or obscured in the edited version.",

        "No"
      ],
