      "question": "Are the round wire-rimmed spectacles present on the elderly gentleman's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly gentlemanâ€™s face is mostly obscured by a blur, but the drawing style doesn't show any indications of wire-rimmed spectacles. When face features are drawn in such simplified illustrations, wire-rimmed spectacles would typically be visible and distinct. The lack of visual elements representing spectacles leads to the conclusion.",
