      "question": "Is the U.S. $20 bill with its distinctive green color, \"20\" numeral, and architectural design visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design is a sketch representation of a wallet with various currencies. Specific details such as the green color and '20' numeral that are indicative of the U.S. $20 bill are absent. The edited image primarily focuses on the concept of global currencies and does not show detailed representations of specific note designs.",

      "question": "Is the Qatari Riyal note with its pink-orange hue, Arabic script, and serial number \"103 01\" present and recognizable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains an illustrative approach with no visible detail of specific banknotes including color or script. The depiction lacks clarity to identify currency particulars like the pink-orange color, Arabic script, or specific serial numbers.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, includes a sketched representation that doesnâ€™t provide a detailed depiction or identifiable features like the yellow-brown color or the lion capital symbol of an Indian Rupee 50 note. Thus, these specifics cannot be discerned.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not clearly illustrate particular features across the currency notes such as the portrait of George Washington or the 'ONE DOLLAR' text, which are characteristic of the U.S. $1 bill. The sketch provides only a conceptual representation.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all four banknotes (U.S. $20, Qatari Riyal, Indian Rupee 50, U.S. $1) present together in the same visual space?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B merely shows a drawing of a wallet with generalized suggestions of currency notes without specifying types. As it lacks detailed visual cues for identifying distinct currency designs distinctly, it's impossible to confirm the presence of all four specified notes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the original dominant colors of the banknotes (green for USD, pink-orange for QAR, yellow-brown for INR) preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B utilizes a monotone color scheme (light blue), and does not maintain or highlight the distinctive colors typical of the USD (green), QAR (pink-orange), or INR (yellow-brown). Instead, it represents a conceptual illustration.",
