      "question": "Does the soccer ball retain exactly 12 black pentagonal panels and 20 white hexagonal panels arranged in a spherical configuration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer ball is depicted in a comic or pop art-style illustration which alters the appearance of the panels. While it maintains a general soccer ball pattern, the specific count of panels is not discernible, nor is their precise arrangement as per a traditional soccer ball configuration. Therefore, the exact count and arrangement of panels cannot be confirmed.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the soccer ball depicted as a three-dimensional sphere with curved surfaces and proper perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the soccer ball as a part of a comic-style illustration. Despite the stylized depiction, the ball retains characteristics that suggest a three-dimensional spherical form, such as shading and curvature lines that mimic a sphere with perspective.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the goalpost maintain a rectangular frame with two vertical posts and one horizontal crossbar forming a standard goal shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a goalpost in a pop-art style. Despite this stylistic portrayal, the framework consisting of two vertical posts and one horizontal bar is clear, forming a standard rectangular goal shape.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the net of the goalpost is illustrated with intersecting lines that form visible grid patterns, indicating square or rectangular cells. These lines and cells are observable despite the stylized comic effect.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the soccer ball placed prominently in the foreground, clearly positioned in front of the goalpost, with parts of the goal, including the posts, visible behind the ball.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seams between the panels of the soccer ball are stylized and drawn in the comic illustration style. Their alignment is consistent with the overall pattern, but not explicitly clear or traditionally visible, due to the stylized nature of the image.",

      "question_id": "Q7",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
