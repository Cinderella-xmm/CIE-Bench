        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fireplace remains as a prominent, centrally located feature on the wall in the room.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no decorative items in the form of small objects placed directly above the fireplace.
