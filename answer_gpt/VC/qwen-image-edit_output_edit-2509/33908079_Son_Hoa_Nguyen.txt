    "Question": "Q1: Is the orange circular logo with the white animal figure clearly visible on the sack?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the region where the logo might appear is simplified into a more cartoonish representation, with emphasis on clear lines and a stylized aesthetic. In this style, the details are not as comprehensive as in a photograph. The appearance of a well-defined logo, similar to real-world branding, is not visible. The sack carries a design that is more about color blocks and simple symbols than detailed or specific logos.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the worker’s right hand visibly reaching into the tea bush to pick leaves?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both of the worker's hands are positioned toward the tea plants, but the illustration style keeps the detail minimalist compared to a photograph. The right hand, in particular, is shown extended towards the plants, indicating a gesture of picking or interacting with the leaves. However, due to the stylized nature, it doesn't depict intricate movements like precisely reaching into the bush. The depiction is more symbolic of an action than specific hand placement.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the worker leaning forward with her upper body angled downward toward the tea plants?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character's posture is a simplified portrayal where the upper body clearly angles downward towards the tea plants, mimicking an action similar to picking. The artistic choice captures the essence of this posture enough to convey the leaning action, even though it's expressed in a less detailed way than a photo.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the sack positioned on the left side of the worker’s waist and hanging downward?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sack is illustrated on the character's waist. Given the style, the placement appears roughly on the waist's side, which can imply a left or right positioning relative to the observer. However, the simplistic design with the generic hanging shape suggests a downward orientation in alignment with gravity, typical of how a sack might hang from a waist.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the tea plants arranged in distinct diagonal rows across a sloped terrain?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents the tea plants in an artistic style with simplified representations of rows and slopes, often depicted using clear, patterned depictions that suggest contouring and organization, typical for sloping farmland. Although more stylized than realistic, it captures the essence of systematic agricultural planting as seen in diagonally arranged rows on a slope.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the worker wear a long-sleeved olive-green shirt?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the worker is depicted wearing a long-sleeved shirt with a color that can be interpreted as olive-green. This aligns with stylized choices where colors may be simplified but still reminiscent of real-life clothing, reflecting the same color theme visible in the original photograph.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the worker’s dark hair styled in a low ponytail with some loose strands near the face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hair styling of the character is simplified into a low ponytail representation. Although the art style avoids intricate details, the basic shapes and structure suggest a clean ponytail with no visible loose strands, due to its minimalist approach.",
    "answer": "No"
