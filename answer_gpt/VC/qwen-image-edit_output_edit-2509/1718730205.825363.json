      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the cosmic vortex depicted as a multi-layered spiral structure with concentric rings winding inward toward a central point?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a cosmic vortex, which clearly appears as a multi-layered spiral structure. The concentric rings are visually apparent and are winding inward. This appearance aligns with the common depiction of spirals where forms coil towards a central point, conveying the dynamic motion characteristic of such scenes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there multiple trees with rounded, full canopies positioned in the foreground and midground of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several trees are observed with rounded, full canopies, both in the foreground and further in the midground. The visual arrangement depicts a forest with distinctive shapes, aligning with the characteristics of many landscapes where trees exhibit these canopy shapes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cosmic vortex positioned directly above the forest, occupying the upper half of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cosmic vortex is indeed positioned dominantly above the forest and occupies a significant portion of the upper half of the image. The visual placement ensures it is central to the scene, which commonly represents the cosmic theme effectively in visual storytelling.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a calm, reflective body of water in the foreground, mirroring the sky and surrounding landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a calm, reflective body of water in the foreground. The design suggests the presence of land and trees, but there is no evident body of water present to mirror the sky and landscape, diverging from typical scenes that incorporate such reflective elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there mountain ranges visible in the background, situated behind the trees and beneath the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a background with elements under the cosmic vortex and sky. However, the specific depiction of mountain ranges is not clearly visible due to the artistic representation being focused on the cosmic theme. The design does not prioritize the visual impact commonly associated with distant mountain ranges.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees feature foliage that displays a distinct pink or rose-colored tone. This color choice stands out vividly against the cosmic backdrop, reflecting artistic liberties often used to enhance scenic beauty and mood through distinct color palettes.",
