      "question": "Is the girl’s long dark hair with bangs present and extending past her shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a girl with long dark hair that clearly extends past her shoulders. The hairstyle appears neat and streamlined, suggesting it is intentionally managed to fall straight. Based on this observation, combined with common knowledge about hair length, it confirms the description. However, there is no visible indication of bangs in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the blouse have visible lace trim along the cuffs and collar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl is wearing a blouse with detailed lace patterns visible around the cuffs and collar. The lace is intricate and prominently featured in the design, which suggests the blouse is designed to emphasize these decorative elements. This observation combined with common knowledge about fashion helps confirm the presence of lace trim.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the girl wearing a black pleated skirt that extends below the waistline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the girl wearing a clothing item that appears below her waistline, but it isn't fully visible or clearly detailed as a black pleated skirt. There are illustrations that may symbolize clothing, which does not fully verify the actual length or style as pleated. Based on visual evaluation and common fashion knowledge, the skirt style cannot be clearly confirmed.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the violin positioned under the girl’s chin with her left hand on the neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the violin is placed in a manner typical of violin playing, under the girl's chin, secured by her lower jaw, while the left hand is positioned along the neck of the instrument, which is a common pose for violinists. This setting is consistent with known violin playing techniques.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there an arched window behind the girl emitting soft, diffused light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show clear architectural features like an arched window. The background is primarily composed of musical notations and a structured design indicative of a drawing rather than real-life settings. Considering these visual cues against the narrow description provided, an arched window is not visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a golden candlestick with a bundle of reeds or quills on a wooden table to the right of the girl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the space to the right of the girl mainly contains musical notes and does not feature any realistic elements such as a candlestick or set table commonly found in more photorealistic scenes. Therefore, recognizing these items cannot be supported based on the visible design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the girl looking slightly downward with a calm and focused expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has blurred features where expressions would typically be evaluated, and considering the artistic representation does not imply facial emotion accurately, common cues cannot determine if the girl is looking downward or retains a specific expression.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there visible lace patterns on the sleeve cuffs and collar of the blouse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Similarly to Question 2, Image B showcases an intricate lace pattern prominently around the cuffs and collar. The pattern's visibility and clear depiction suggest intentional focus on lace decorations, confirming the presence of these details.",
