    "Question": "Q1: Are the floral and paisley embroidery patterns present and accurately replicated as carved reliefs on the saree?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture is adorned with intricate carved patterns that mimic the style of detailed embroidery. These resemble the intricate floral and paisley patterns seen in traditional saree designs, though in relief format. However, the precise matching or exact replication of the patterns from an embroidered saree to stone carvings cannot be seen without comparison.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the saree draped with the pallu over the left shoulder and the pleats aligned vertically at the front?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the drapery of the figure appears as a styled relief, providing the impression of a cloth draped over the body; however, it isn't specifically clear if it mimics a saree drape with a pallu over the left shoulder as seen in a typical saree style. The alignment does not depict pleats distinctly.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the multi-layered choker necklace positioned around the neck, with dangling elements visible?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture showcases a carved necklace around where the neck would be. This necklace has a detailed and ornate design which is typical in traditional jewelry, but details like dangling elements, as seen in a fabric or metal choker, aren't distinctly replicated as carvings donâ€™t showcase them in movement.",
    "answer": "No"
},
{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the bracelet present on the right wrist, matching the design and placement of the original?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the right wrist of the sculpture displays a carved bracelet. The bracelet appears as part of the overall ornamental design, consistent with traditional sculptural styles of representing jewelry, thus matching the placement if not precisely the design as in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
},
{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the ring present on the right hand, specifically on the index finger?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stone carving does not detail individual small items such as rings on specific fingers, as this level of detail is less feasible in typical stone relief representations.",
    "answer": "No"
},
{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the wide, patterned border of the saree preserved along the edges of the pallu and hem?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the garment mimic a border with decorative relief, typical of classical sculpture styles to imply decorative edges. However, identifying this as a replication of a saree border as in Image A through carving is challenging without explicit detail visibility.",
    "answer": "Yes"
},
{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the figure maintain a standing, upright posture with proportional limbs and a balanced silhouette?",
    "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B shows a standing figure in an upright posture with limbs that appear proportionate and a balanced silhouette, a common trait in traditional sculptures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
