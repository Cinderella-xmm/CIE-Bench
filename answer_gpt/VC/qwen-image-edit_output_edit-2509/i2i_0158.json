      "question": "Is the car rendered in its original red color in all views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car appears red in all three views: front, side, and rear. The consistency of color in all appearances suggests that the car retains its original red color throughout the image. By analyzing these details without yet referring to Image A, the reasoning aligns with the notion that the car’s red color is maintained across views.",

      "question": "Does the front view retain the detailed grille design and Ford emblem in its original position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the front view of the car where the detailed grille combined with horizontal lines is clearly visible, along with the Ford emblem positioned in the center of the grille, which matches typical Ford Mustang designs seen in real-world imagery. Given these observations in Image B alone, it confirms that both elements are retained in their presumed original positions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the same style and configuration of LED daytime running lights visible in both the front and side views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the LEDs with a specific pattern, likely resembling vertical or angular lines, that is noticeable in the front view. However, daytime running lights are typically more visible in direct frontal views rather than side views, and Image B’s side view does not prominently display these components. Thus, analyzing solely Image B, the answer is 'No', as the side view lacks visibility of the LED style evident in the front view.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do all views show the same specific design and detail of the car’s alloy wheels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of Image B indicates consistent portrayal of the alloy wheels design in both the front view and side view. Features such as the wheel spokes and probable alloy styling appear to remain unchanged across these views, pointing towards uniformity in the design representation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the body shape and proportions of the Mustang accurately represented in all views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the car’s body shape, including its aerodynamic curves and iconic features typical of a Mustang, is depicted consistently in the front, side, and rear views. These layouts reinforce the accurate portrayal of body shape and proportions consistently across all views shown, inferring correctness in representation.",
