    "Question": "Q1: Is the U.S. national insignia (white star within a blue circle, flanked by red and white bars) present on the wings and fuselage of the aircraft?",
    "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the aircraft, which is enclosed in a display case, has markings on its wings and fuselage. The markings consist of a white star on a circular background, flanked by horizontal bars, indicating the U.S. national insignia. This insignia is commonly used on military aircraft to denote American origins. Recognizing this insignia is an application of world knowledge regarding military aircraft markings. Comparing with Image A, the same insignia is visible on both the wings and fuselage. Thus, the insignia is present.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are there two radial engines mounted beneath the wings of the aircraft, one on each side?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the model aircraft depicted in the display case features two engines mounted symmetrically under the main wings, one on each side. These engines are housed in round nacelles, characteristic of radial engines. Identifying these structures involves world knowledge of aircraft design and engine types. When compared to Image A, the same type of engine arrangement is visible under the wings, confirming the presence of two radial engines.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does each engine have a three-bladed propeller attached to its front?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows that each of the two engines on the model aircraft has a propeller with three blades mounted at the front. The symmetry and mounting style of the blades suggest standard propeller designs for radial engines on aircraft, which is validated by understanding common aircraft configurations. Image A similarly displays three-bladed propellers on the engine fronts, reinforcing this observation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a rounded, transparent cockpit canopy located at the front of the fuselage?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the model aircraft's cockpit area is encased in a rounded transparent dome at the front, indicative of a cockpit canopy. This design allows visibility for the crew and is typical of aircraft configurations from certain eras, informed by historical aircraft design knowledge. Comparing with Image A, the same transparent cockpit canopy is present, depicting continuity in design across both images.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the wings extend straight and symmetrically from the fuselage, forming a dihedral angle?",
    "explanation": "Upon examination of Image B, the model aircraft's wings extend symmetrically from the fuselage but do not visibly form a dihedral angle; they are horizontally straight rather than angled upwards. A dihedral angle typically refers to wings angling upwards relative to the horizontal plane for stability purposes. Image A shows straight wings as well, confirming there isn't a dihedral angle in the wing design.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the tail section composed of a vertical stabilizer and two horizontal stabilizers with small fins at the ends?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the model aircraft's tail assembly comprises a central vertical stabilizer along with horizontal stabilizers extending on either side. These stabilizers have small vertical fins at their tips. Knowledge regarding aircraft tail design indicates that such configurations are used for improved stability and control. Image A displays the same structure, confirming the presence of these components on both images.",
    "answer": "Yes"
