    "Question": "Q1: Is the red circular insignia still present on the left lapel of the suit jacket?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the suit jacket has a vibrant, colorful pattern with a mix of blue and pink lines, which makes it difficult to identify small details such as a red circular insignia. However, upon closely examining the visual details, there is no clear indication of a red insignia visible on the colorful jacket design. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the insignia is not present in Image B based on its visual cues and common dress code practices.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the ear clearly visible on the left side of the head in its original anatomical position?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pastel-colored hair styling, which resembles cotton candy, partially obscures the head and makes it challenging to see the ear in its traditional position. Using world knowledge, ears are generally located at the side of the head, but in this image, there is no visible ear on the left side, leading to the conclusion that the ear is not clearly visible.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the mouth open in a natural smile showing the upper row of teeth?",
    "explanation": "Image B has a blurred facial region, making it impossible to visually confirm any facial expressions, including a smile exposing teeth. Based on the common appearance of facial features expected in images, smiles are usually discerned from visible mouth cues and teeth alignment, which are absent due to the blur.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the nose retaining its original shape with a distinct bridge and rounded tip?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, facial features are obscured due to blurring, preventing accurate identification of the nose structure, including its bridge and tip. While noses generally have distinctive shapes, the blur precludes any shape retention knowledge.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the head turned to the right in a three-quarter profile view?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the head appears more frontal due to the alignment of colorful hair styling. Though slightly angled, the frontal view is more noticeable than a three-quarter turn; generally, in three-quarter views, facial features would be more side visible, but Image B does not present this characteristic.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the background uniformly off-white with no additional textures or objects?",

    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the shadows under the chin and along the jawline soft and consistent with even frontal lighting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chin and jawline are not distinctly visible due to blurring, but surrounding areas indicate generally soft shadowing, characteristic of frontal lighting often purposefully applied in professional photography to reduce harsh shadow lines.",
    "answer": "Yes"
