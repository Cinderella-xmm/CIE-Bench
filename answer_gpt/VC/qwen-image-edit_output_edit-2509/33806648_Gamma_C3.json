    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the fallen log still present in the foreground, lying diagonally across the cave floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground shows the path and some rocks, but the visual focus is dominated by the magical arch and figure. However, upon close examination, a section of the fallen log can be seen along the path, indicating it is still present. Logic dictates that details like fallen logs often remain unless purposefully removed in editing. The appearance of the path has been altered with the addition of blue elements, but does not obscure what remains of the log.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does sunlight still enter from the arch opening and illuminate the right side of the cave interior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right side of the cave is bright and illuminated, indicative of sunlight entering from the arch opening. The same casting of light suggests the direction and presence of sunlight remain unchanged, consistent with natural lighting observations.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the rocky, uneven ground surface visible beneath the arch and extending toward the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the addition of the fantastical elements, the rocky, uneven ground surface continues to be observable beneath the arch and toward the foreground, indicating no substantial alteration to this aspect of the scene.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bright sky and distant tree-covered hillside still visible through the arch opening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bright white light and some glimpse of the distant landscape through the archway, consistent with looking towards bright sky and hills in a natural setting as seen in Image A. It suggests that despite the digital modifications, the visual extent through the opening remains exposed to the sky and trees.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the cave interior structured with converging rock walls and a clear path leading toward the arch opening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the structure of the cave interior with converging rock walls and a visible path that leads towards the arch opening. Though it is cloaked with new digital enhancements (magical arch), the underlying structure of the cave and its spatial flow remain prominent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the surrounding rock walls still composed of layered sedimentary rock with natural weathering patterns and beige-to-brown coloration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the magical and stylized enhancements in Image B, the base composition of the rock walls as layered sedimentary with weathered patterns is still observable. The beige-to-brown coloration is characteristic of such natural rock formations, which hasn't been fully obscured by the added effects.",
