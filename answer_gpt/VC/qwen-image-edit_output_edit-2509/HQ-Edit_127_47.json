      "question": "Are there exactly five ducklings swimming in the foreground of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon examination of the water surface scene within the globe, there are several ducklings present. However, instead of five, there appear to be fewer due to the limited number of shown objects within the glass. The design within a globe naturally restricts the number of elements to maintain clarity and aesthetic balance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the ducklings have their heads above water and bodies partially submerged, indicating swimming motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ducklings inside the globe appear as plastic figures partially submerged, resembling typical bath toys rather than depicting a natural swimming motion. Their form and lack of movement, combined with a glossy finish, suggest they are not in motion.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the bed of smooth, rounded stones clearly visible beneath the water surface in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's depiction within the glass sphere shows a bed of smooth, rounded stones beneath the water clearly. The material often used in such decorative items ensures clarity and visibility, enhanced by an artistic representation, supporting the visibility of these stones beneath the water.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the reflection of the evergreen trees and sky clearly visible on the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the glass globe has a background of evergreen trees and sky, the nature of the design as an enclosed diorama with plastic elements means it lacks reflective surfaces like in natural settings. Additionally, the material of the globe (such as glass) restricts the reflection properties seen in image A, making distinct reflections improbable.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are tall evergreen trees densely arranged along both sides of the lake, forming a natural corridor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the trees are arranged within the sphereâ€™s backdrop, showcasing a miniature representation with trees positioned densely along the sides to give an impression of continuity and containment of the lake scene within the limited space.",

      "question": "Is a mist-covered mountain range visible in the background beyond the lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction inside the glass sphere does display a mountain range; however, it is not shown as mist-covered. To enhance clarity and fit within the diorama concept, the mountains are presented in crisp detail in a background scene without the presence of mist.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors of the scene green (trees), blue-green (water), and brown (rocks)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, dominant colors include green for the trees, blue-green for the water, and brown for rocks. These colors are common in representations of natural scenes and are used within decorative globes to provide an aesthetically pleasing and recognizable depiction of a natural landscape.",
