      "question": "Are the dog's large, round, black eyes clearly visible and positioned symmetrically on the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's eyes are noticeable for their large and round shape, which are essential features for many dog breeds. They are positioned symmetrically on the face, a common characteristic for balanced facial features in animals and most living things, enhancing both aesthetics and physiological functions like depth perception. This symmetrical positioning is visually obvious in the image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dog's black nose clearly present and centered on the snout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dog's black nose in Image B is a prominent feature, typically found at the center of the dog's snout. Its dark coloration stands out against the lighter fur of the dog, making it easily identifiable and highlighting its central placement, which is common in canine anatomy for efficient scent detection.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's mouth is depicted as open, with a visible pink tongue. This feature suggests a relaxed or playful demeanor, as dogs often pant or play with their mouths open. The pink tongue is a distinct aspect that contrasts with the dog's fur and is easily recognized.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both ears floppy and positioned symmetrically on either side of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the image, the dog's ears are designed to be symmetrical and appear floppy, a trait often associated with particular dog breeds. Their equal placement on both sides of the head adds to the visual symmetry typical in mammalian characteristics and contributes to the dog’s expressive appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no evidence of a dark collar or a silver-colored metal ring around the dog’s neck. Instead, the neck area is adorned with a colorful scarf, which is visually prominent and covers the neck area where a collar would typically be seen.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the hat positioned on the dog’s head with two white pom-poms visible on either side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a hat on the dog’s head, but instead of white pom-poms, the hat is designed with unique patterns and textures possibly resembling wood carvings. The lack of white pom-poms suggests a departure from typical winter hat designs to a more stylized, ornamental headpiece.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a colorful scarf is clearly wrapped around the dog’s neck, forming an intricate pattern reminiscent of Lego bricks. This scarf is visually different from typical fabric scarfs but still forms a visible arrangement around the neck area.",
