      "question": "Does the edited image retain the original four blades of the ceiling fan?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there is a ceiling fan encased in a snow globe. By visually analyzing the object resembling a ceiling fan, it is apparent that the fan still has four blades. This matches standard ceiling fan designs, which commonly feature four or more blades. Therefore, the edited image retains the original four blades of the ceiling fan.",

      "question": "Is the central hub structure of the ceiling fan still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting the edited image, it is clear that the ceiling fan inside the snow globe has a central hub. This hub is necessary to attach and mechanically support the fan blades, hence its presence in both images. Therefore, the central hub structure is indeed still present in the edited image.",

      "question": "Does the edited image preserve the metallic texture and color scheme of the ceiling fan?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image displays the ceiling fan within a snow globe with similar metallic textures and colors as seen in the original image. Both the edited and original images show a metallic, possibly brushed steel texture that is common in ceiling fans. Thus, the metallic texture and color scheme are preserved in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the blades arranged symmetrically around the central hub in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In typical ceiling fan designs, the blades are symmetrically arranged around the central hub to ensure balanced airflow and function. The edited image shows the ceiling fan with blades symmetrically placed around the hub inside the snow globe, similar to the arrangement in the original image. This confirms the symmetrical arrangement of the blades is maintained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the connection points between the blades and the central hub visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at the edited image, where the fan is encased in a snow globe, the connection points of the blades to the central hub are visible. They are depicted similarly to the original image, where these connections are necessary for the structural integrity and functioning of the ceiling fan. Thus, the connection points are visible in the edited image.",
