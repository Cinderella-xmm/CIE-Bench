      "question": "Is the V-shaped dual-wing silhouette of the building preserved in the edited version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure resembling a building is actually a large robot and does not exhibit a V-shaped dual-wing silhouette. Instead, it has a symmetrical design typical of robotic structures. There is no indication of any building-like V-shape present in the robot's design. Thus, based on the visual cues and using knowledge of architectural and robotic structures, the V-shaped silhouette is not present.",

      "question": "Are the floors stacked in a consistent, repeating modular pattern from bottom to top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is a robot, and its structure does not consist of floors or a modular pattern like a building. Instead, the design is made up of robotic parts, which do not mimic the repeating modular pattern typical of building floors. Thus, using common knowledge of building architecture versus robotics design, the floors are not stacked in a repeating modular pattern.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the windows and balconies aligned horizontally on each floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no windows or balconies to be aligned. The image depicts a robot with circuits and panels, not architectural elements. Based on understanding of architectural design versus a robot's structure, there are neither windows nor balconies in Image B for horizontal alignment.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the two wings of the building symmetrically positioned relative to the central vertical axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robotic figure is symmetrical, but it does not have 'wings' in the context of a building's architectural design. The robot's symmetry is more about its arms and body structure rather than wings of a building. Therefore, based on recognizing differences between building wings and robotic arms, there are no wings symmetrically positioned as part of the building.",

      "question": "Are the yellow awnings present on the balconies in their original positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no balconies or yellow awnings. The robotic structure does not have architectural elements like balconies or awnings. Thus, combining knowledge of building structures with robots, it is clear that there are no balcony awnings present.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a visible separation between the window openings and the projecting balcony overhangs on each floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no window openings or projecting balcony overhangs exist as the subject is a robot. The structure of Image B is not designed to resemble a building with floors but instead is a mechanical construct without architectural features such as window openings or balconies.",
