      "question": "Is the mouth wide open in a roaring expression with visible teeth and tongue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the individuals portrayed have blurred faces, making it impossible to discern features such as the mouth's expression, whether it is open or closed, or if teeth and tongue are visible. The depiction of the chests and arms does not indicate a mouth configuration. Therefore, based solely on this edited image, the question cannot be definitively answered.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the eyes narrowed and focused, indicating anger or exertion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Again, in Image B, facial details such as the eyes are blurred, preventing any analysis related to their shape or expression. As there are no visible eyes due to the blur, it is impossible to determine if they are narrowed or focused, or if they show expressions of anger or exertion.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the head have a balding crown with hair along the sides and back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The individuals in Image B have blurred faces, making it difficult to determine any specific hair characteristics such as a balding crown or the presence of hair along the sides and back. The visible parts of the figures do not indicate any distinct hair features matching this description.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the jawline strong and angular, with a defined chin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurred nature of the faces in Image B means that the jawline and chin cannot be evaluated for these features. The angles of the jawline and definition of the chin are obscured in this image, making analysis of this characteristic impossible.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the head located at the top center of the figure, aligned with the spine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the blurring of the faces, the heads of the individuals can be visually inferred to be located at their expected anatomical positions, which is at the top center of each figure, aligned with the spine. This characteristic is generally consistent with human physiology and the depiction of these figures.",
      "weight": 2,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "With the faces in Image B blurred, determining the presence or absence of facial hair such as beards or mustaches is impossible. No visible details allow for a conclusion about whether the faces are clean-shaven.",
