      "question": "Are both arms extended horizontally to the sides, forming a symmetrical T-shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's arms appear to be outstretched, but due to the posture resembling traditional Eastern art forms, they may not be forming a rigidly symmetrical T-shape. The arms are extended but not strictly horizontal -- the right hand is slightly angled and the left hand is obscured by the robe's flare, resulting in a lack of perfect symmetry. Combining this observation with common art depictions, it's concluded that the T-shape is not achieved.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the head tilted upward and slightly toward the left side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the head seems to be oriented upward, hinted at by the curvature of the neck and the positioning relative to the flowing pattern upon the robes. However, without distinct facial contours available and relying solely on the rest of the figure's positioning, it's plausible to conclude that the head might be generally aligned upward without significant tilt to the left.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the figure have a beard and hair covered by a hooded garment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From Image B, the appearance gives an illusion of hair due to the patterns and flow of the robes, coupled with common art depictions of religious figures. There is no explicit hooded garment observedâ€”the garment is elaborately patterned but not conclusively hooded, nor is there a visible depiction of a beard. Hence, the attire seems like a traditional robe, devoid of explicit beard or hood features.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both hands open with palms facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the finer detailing of the open hands and their orientation implies that both hands are extended and facing outward. This can be derived from the visible lines and curves which are indicative of fingers spread - a common artistic representation of opening a hand.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the robe cover the entire body from shoulders to the base of the statue, with vertical folds running down the front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a garment covering the central body mass with what seems like intricate designs and patterns as opposed to simple vertical folds. Traditional works with such style often play more with fluidity and less with hard verticality. Thus, while the garment does wrap the figure fully, it does not exhibit the vertical folds as strictly linear or prominent in their texture.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the statue shown in a frontal pose, viewed from a low angle looking upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In this representation, Image B does not showcase a traditional pose viewed from below. Rather, the orientation and perspective imply a more centered alignment with no exaggerated low-angle perspective often used to emphasize size and stature in portraiture. This is indicated by the relatively flat appearance of the background and the way the robe drapes without distortion.",
