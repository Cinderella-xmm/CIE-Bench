      "question": "Is the skater depicted in a mid-air crouched posture with both arms extended outward for balance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see a figure crouched in a mid-air position with bent knees, indicative of being airborne. Both arms are extended outward in a manner consistent with maintaining balance, which is common practice in skating, especially in jumps. The posture suggests readiness to navigate landing or maneuvering, noted from observations of similar activities.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the skater’s left foot placed firmly on the skateboard while the right foot is slightly raised off the board?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the skater's left foot appears to be in contact with the skateboard. However, the position of the right foot is not raised off the board; both feet seem to be in contact for optimal control during mid-air execution of moves, which provides stability.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the skater’s head and eyes look toward the right side of the frame, indicating forward momentum?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater's body is oriented forward, and combined with typical skating posture, the skater may be heading in the direction depicted, but due to the blurred face, the exact direction of gaze cannot be scientifically asserted based solely on this depiction. Common sense tells us that forward movement in such athletic feats usually implies a forward gaze, yet the specific visual cue is not apparent.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the skater positioned above the surface of the ramp, indicating he is airborne?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "An analysis of Image B shows the skater is depicted above the ground, which suggests being airborne. The surrounding tells, such as the position and curvature of the skateboarding environment also signify that the skater achieved lift from jumping on a ramp.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a second person, an older man in a dark jacket, visible in the background running across the ramp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surroundings have neon structures and a futuristic urban layout which doesn't support the necessary features depicting another person present. It showcases an individual scenario without background characters. The second person detail is not evident.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a curved ramp structure forming a bowl-like shape in the foreground, beneath the skater?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the environment consists of linear and angled constructs common in advanced urban settings, without any bowl-like structures beneath the skater. The futuristic design emphasizes individual motion in an urban scenario. Hence, the bowl shape seen commonly in traditional skate parks isn’t presented here.",
