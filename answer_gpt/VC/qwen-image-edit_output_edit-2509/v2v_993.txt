    "Question": "Q1: Does the chibi character maintain the exact martial arts pose, including the forward leg stance and outward-facing palms?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character is seated within an Instagram frame, which makes it impossible to maintain the exact martial arts pose requiring a wide leg stance and arm positioning. The legs are bent and the arms are raised differently due to the setting. Therefore, the chibi character does not maintain the exact stance seen in Image A.",
