    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the red velvet cushion with visible quilted texture present beneath the saxophone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object placed on the cushion is a serpent, not a saxophone. The cushion beneath the serpent is indeed a red velvet cushion with a visible quilted texture. We can deduce this from the visible folding and indentations on the surface, which are characteristic of quilted fabrics.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a thin gold trim running along the outer edge of the red cushion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a thin gold trim running along the outer edge of the red cushion that is beneath the serpent. This detail is visible as a metallic-like band surrounding the cushion, providing a decorative finish.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the lighting source positioned above the saxophone, creating a bright central glow that fades into darkness toward the edges of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a similar lighting setup to Image A, with the serpent instead of a saxophone. The lighting source is above, creating a spotlight effect. This results in a bright central area directly on the object (serpent) and fades into darkness as it moves away from the center, typical of cinematic lighting.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the saxophone (or transformed serpent) positioned diagonally across the cushion, extending from the lower left to the upper right of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent mimics the positioning of the saxophone in Image A. It is positioned diagonally across the cushion, extending from the lower left to the upper right of the frame. This diagonal positioning enhances the dynamic visual appeal.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background uniformly dark, with no visible objects or textures other than the spotlight glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is dark and uniform with no visible objects or textures other than the spotlight glow focusing on the serpent. This creates a dramatic and isolated atmosphere, accentuating the main subject.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the transformed serpent retain a highly reflective, metallic surface with visible highlights and specular reflections consistent with polished brass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The serpent in Image B features a highly reflective, metallic surface. It resembles polished metal, probably resembling brass adorned with jewel-like elements. The highlights and reflections are consistent with a polished metallic finish, ensuring it appears vibrant and luxurious.",
