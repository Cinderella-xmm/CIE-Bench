    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the deep, blocky lug pattern of the tire treads?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the turtle's shell is fitted with tires that have a deep, blocky lug pattern. This pattern is crucial for off-road or rugged terrain vehicles, providing enhanced grip and traction. These visual elements are consistent with the lug pattern seen in typical off-road tires.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the embossed text \"ROCKS TIRE\" and \"SUPER SWAMPER\" visible on the sidewalls of the tires?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a mechanical turtle with tires that do not seem to have visible sidewall text. The focus is more on the fantastical and mechanical aspects rather than showing detailed tire branding. A close inspection does not reveal any embossed text like 'ROCKS TIRE' or 'SUPER SWAMPER' on the sides of these tires.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the five-spoke designs of the wheel hubs still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the tires are equipped on the turtle with hub designs that do not resemble traditional five-spoke patterns. They appear to be more stylized to fit the mechanical theme of the turtle, focusing on a more fantastical design aesthetic rather than standard automotive wheel designs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the matte, rubber-textured surface of the tires maintained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tires on the mechanical turtle in the edited image still exhibit a matte, rubber-like texture, which is indicative of realistic tire material. This texture is discernible in the way light interacts with the surface, providing a proper appearance of conventional rubber tires.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the tread blocks evenly spaced and proportionally consistent with the original tires?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image maintains tires on the turtle with tread blocks that appear evenly spaced and consistent in proportion. These characteristics are essential for realistic off-road tires, ensuring stability and even wear, which is also a convincing detail in the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the edited image contain exactly four tires, corresponding to the original stack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image of the mechanical turtle, there are four visible tires, matching the typical layout on vehicles and consistent with common vehicle construction that uses four wheels for balance and stability.",
