      "question": "Are the dark wooden beams forming geometric patterns on the facades of the buildings clearly visible and structurally accurate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings inside the snow globe exhibit dark wooden beams that form geometric patterns typical of timber-framed architecture. This style is known for horizontal and vertical frameworks creating a grid-like pattern that supports the structure. By examining these details within the globe, the beams are not only visible but also maintain the structural accuracy typical of such architecture.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the buildings feature steeply pitched gabled roofs with dormer windows positioned at regular intervals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings encapsulated within the snow globe maintain steeply pitched gabled roofs, characteristic of architecture designed to handle rain and snow. However, dormer windows are not discernible due to the miniature representation, and they may not be positioned at regular intervals as the scale has potentially minimized finer details.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a pedestrian bridge spanning the canal in the mid-ground, connecting the two sides of the street?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close examination of Image B, within the snow globe, there is a miniature representation of the canal with a small bridge in the mid-ground, connecting both sides. This feature is central to the scene and suggests a pedestrian bridge exists.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the canal surface reflect the surrounding buildings and sky with clear, mirror-like fidelity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the canal depicted within the snow globe reflects the tiny buildings with a degree of clarity that matches how realistic water reflections would appear in a real-world scene. While the miniature exaggerates certain aspects, the reflection within the snow globe remains smooth and mirror-like.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there flower boxes containing green plants visible along the balcony of the large building on the right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B within the snow globe shows architectural details including balconies, but due to the miniature scale and limited detail resolution, flower boxes with green plants are not clearly discernible on the balcony of the large building on the right.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are stone bases and metal railings present along the canal edges beneath the buildings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the miniature representation retains the canal shape, the reduced size causes finer details like stone bases and metal railings to not be distinctly evident around the edges of the canal beneath the buildings.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the windows arranged in vertical and horizontal lines on the facades, matching the timber frame divisions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature scene inside the snow globe presents the building facades with timber frames that create a grid pattern. The windows adhere to this pattern, visible in vertical and horizontal lines, matching the divisions created by the timber framework, which is characteristic of such architectural design.",
