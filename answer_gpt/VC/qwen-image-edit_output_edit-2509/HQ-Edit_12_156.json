    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the structure retain four distinct legs forming a wide base that converge upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower does not have four distinct legs forming a wide base. Instead, the structure appears as a singular spiraling tower wrapped in vines and topped with a crystal-like structure, devoid of the characteristic Eiffel Tower legs that converge upward.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the tower’s shape vertically tapered, narrowing progressively from base to spire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower is more akin to a mystical or fantasy spire, wrapped with vines and flowers, terminating in a crystal-like structure. While the spiraling effect could give a sense of tapering, it does not exhibit a progressive narrowing from base to spire in the traditional sense as seen in tall classical structures like the Eiffel Tower.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there three distinct horizontal levels or platforms visible along the tower’s height?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no distinct horizontal levels or platforms visible. The spiraling tower structure does not feature levels, but rather a continuous vine and flower-wrapped form, indicating a fantasy-inspired design rather than a tiered architectural structure.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tower centrally positioned in the image, aligned with the center of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower is indeed centrally positioned within the frame, aligning with the vertical median of the image, which emphasizes its role as the central focal point in the composition.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a straight, symmetrical pathway extending from the foreground directly toward the base of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible straight or symmetrical pathway extending from the foreground to the tower's base. Instead, the base of the tower is surrounded by a circular platform with mystical symbols, lacking any direct pathway leading to it.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the light source (sun or equivalent) located directly behind the base of the tower, creating a halo effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the light source, represented as a bright sun or similar, is positioned behind the tower, creating a luminous backdrop that gives a halo-like appearance. This effect helps to emphasize the tower’s ethereal appearance.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a visible cityscape in the background, extending horizontally behind the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while parts of a cityscape do appear faintly on the horizon, the dominant visual elements are the sky and swirling galaxies in vivid colors, which blend into the background, making the cityscape less prominent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the tower significantly taller than all other structures in the image, dominating the vertical space?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower is depicted as dominating the vertical space dramatically with no other structures in competition for height, emphasizing its prominence and magical appearance.",
