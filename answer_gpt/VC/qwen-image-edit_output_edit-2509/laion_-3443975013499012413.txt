    "Question": "Q1: Is the fish depicted in a continuous, coiled circular posture with its head pointing toward the upper right and tail curving beneath it?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture of the fish is composed of multi-faceted glass making it appear artistically designed, with its head and tail both pointing upwards, forming a shape that looks somewhat circular but primarily gives an impression of swirling movement rather than a tightly coiled circle. Commonly, a continuous coiled posture would be where the fish looks like it’s winding around itself in one smooth motion - Image B is more dynamic with varied angles and less defined coil.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there three distinct barbels extending from the lower jaw of the fish?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the fish is crafted with an emphasis on geometric and faceted design, giving it a crystalline aesthetic. Due to this focus, specific fish anatomical features such as barbels are not detailed. Barbels are thin, whisker-like structures typically seen on species like catfish. In this abstract depiction, there are no visible barbels extending from the lower jaw.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the dorsal fin located along the upper back of the fish and shaped with a serrated edge?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the fish's body shows a dorsal fin, with an angular and zigzagged design, which could be interpreted as a stylized serrated edge. This artistic choice enhances the faceted, dynamic look of the sculpture. Typically, a serrated edge on a dorsal fin would include parallel 'teeth-like' protrusions which can be artistically interpreted here.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the scales arranged in overlapping rows along the body of the fish, running from head to tail?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the fish is designed with a faceted structure, and while it gives an overall impression of scales due to the segmented appearance, it does not display traditional overlapping rows. Actual fish scales are typically aligned in a consistent manner, which is contrasted by the uneven facets in this sculpture.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the tail of the fish curve underneath the body and connect near the head, completing a nearly full circle?",
    "explanation": "Visual analysis of Image B shows the fish’s tail curling upward and not completing a near circle towards the fish's head. The design is more about aesthetic fluidity and dynamism, rather than capturing a realistic circling posture.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there two pectoral fins visible on the side of the fish, one near the head and one further back?",
    "explanation": "In examining Image B, despite its complex geometric design, only one pectoral fin is distinctly identifiable, which is integrated into the abstract form. Typically, fish have a set of pectoral fins for balance and steering, but this sculpture does not distinctly showcase two separate pectoral fins.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the fish carving contained within a square-shaped panel with rounded corners?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the fish is depicted as a standalone sculpture placed on a reflective square pedestal rather than being carved into a panel. In contrast, if an object were contained within a square panel with rounded corners, it would be more aligned with relief carving seen in plaques. The context and presentation do not match this description.",
    "answer": "No"
