      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image preserve the concentric spiral structure of the staircase, with steps forming progressively smaller rings as they descend toward the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the concentric spiral structure of the staircase is preserved with the steps forming progressively smaller rings as they descend toward the center. This is evident from the visual cue of a continuous spiral pattern seen from a top-down perspective, where each level maintains a circular form, typical of a spiral staircase.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the parallel rectangular shadows cast across the steps by sunlight still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parallel rectangular shadows cast across the steps by sunlight are still present. This is observed as similar shading patterns appear across the staircase steps, indicating sunlight filtering through a window or opening and creating shadow patterns consistent with those in such architectural settings.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a dark circular void at the center of the spiral, representing the bottom of the staircase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no clear dark circular void at the center of the spiral representing the bottom of the staircase. Instead, the center is filled by a spiraling object that resembles a dragon-like figure, thus obscuring what would have been the central void.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the handrail remain aligned along the outer edge of the spiral, following the same curvature as the steps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handrail remains aligned along the outer edge of the spiral, following the same curvature as the steps. The wooden railing shown in the image continues to trace the perimeter of the staircase, much like it would in a traditional spiral staircase design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the stone steps still visible with their original texture, including faint veining and minor surface imperfections, even if reinterpreted as scales?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone steps are modified to resemble the scales of a dragon-like creature. Therefore, the original texture, including faint veining and minor surface imperfections typical of stone, is not prominently visible as they have been covered by a scaled texture. This reimagined element alters the original characteristics of the steps.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the shadows fall in the same diagonal direction across the steps as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows appear to fall in the same diagonal direction across the steps as they do in Image A. This suggests the light source, such as sunlight through a window, remains consistent in direction between the two images, creating similar shadow effects on both spirals.",
