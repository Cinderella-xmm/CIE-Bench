      "question": "Are the embossed dragons with detailed scales, claws, and flowing bodies clearly visible on the body of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object features a round shape with embossed dragon motifs on its surface. The dragon designs are prominent, showcasing detailed scales and intricate body flow. The clarity and detail of these dragon motifs suggest that they are a significant part of the design. Based on the visual cues of the well-defined dragon patterns, there is sufficient evidence to confirm the presence of detailed scales and flowing bodies on the object.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the surface of the object textured with raised relief patterns, particularly around the dragon motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the object with noticeable embossed designs, especially where the dragon patterns are located. These relief patterns are raised from the surface, adding a textured quality to the object. The presence of these elevated designs indicates a surface that is textured through embossed relief, making it evident that such texture exists around the dragon motifs.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a distinct spout extending from the side of the object, shaped like a dragon's head with an open mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the object includes a spout extending from the side. This spout is straightforward in design and does not contain any representation akin to a dragon's head or detail that mimics a dragon's open mouth. The spout is more cylindrical in nature without the additional ornate characteristics associated with a dragon's head.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the object retain a silver-colored, highly reflective metallic surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the object in Image B is silver-colored and appears to be metallic in nature. This metallic surface is reflective, as suggested by the gleaming highlights and sheen visible on the object, consistent with materials like silver or polished metal. The visual cues indicate that the object maintains a high level of reflectiveness.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the object positioned upright on a flat surface, such as a wooden table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the object standing upright on a flat wooden surface. The orientation and the base of the object both affirm that the surface is flat, and specifically made of wood, as seen from the texture and color. The object's stable position confirms that it is set upright on a wooden table.",
