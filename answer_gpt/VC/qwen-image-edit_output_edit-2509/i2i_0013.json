      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image features a cartoon-like representation, which includes large, exaggerated white hair that is closely styled to resemble Einstein's famously disheveled hair. This is a common characteristic attributed to Einstein, and the image retains this visual trait despite its comic style. Thus, by comparing the typical description of Einstein's hair and the visual cues from Image B, it's evident that the hair still retains its messy, white appearance.",

      "question": "Does the edited image show Einstein with his tongue out?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not provide any indication of a tongue that is visible or sticking out given that the face area is blurred, hence there is no clear representation of Einstein with his tongue out. This is contrary to the well-known photograph of Einstein. By combining this observation with visual cues, the edited image does not display Einstein with his tongue out.",

      "question": "Does the edited image maintain Einstein’s face shape and proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Though the area of the face in Image B is blurred, the proportions of the image visually suggest a chibi or cartoon rendition, which typically exaggerates features leading to potential alterations in face shape and proportions. Absence of clear specific features implies reliance on general cartoon styling, which may not maintain Einstein's original face shape and proportions. Comparing to usual chibi characteristics—which emphasize exaggeration—the shape and proportions are likely different.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible representation of formal attire, including a suit and a tie with exaggerated cartoon stylization. This indicates that the edited image maintains the concept of Einstein wearing a suit and tie, despite the blurred face. The suit and tie are clear visual cues that align with how Einstein would often be presented in formal portraits.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the facial features are blurred in Image B, it does present a cartoonish depiction which inherently conveys a more lighthearted and playful demeanor through its style. In a chibi representation, the stylized form often implies a playful or whimsical aesthetic. Thus, even though specific facial expressions are not discernible, the overall design implies a playful demeanor.",
