      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the mustache present and shaped in a way that matches the original image, with a curved, thick form extending from both sides of the upper lip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the face area is blurred, which makes assessing the mustache difficult. However, given that the edited version features a figure with a simplified or caricatured design, it's unlikely to match the nuanced depiction of facial hair in a real person from the original image (Image A). Therefore, even without direct visibility, the nature of the simplified design suggests the styled mustache is unlikely to be present in its original form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the hair retain its wild, voluminous, and unevenly distributed white appearance, particularly with strands extending outward from the sides and top of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair on the figure is white, wild, voluminous, and has strands sticking outwards from the top and sides, mimicking a common depiction of Albert Einstein's iconic hairstyle. This hair style maintains the intended characteristics of the original image's hair, focusing on its volume and untamed nature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there vertical black stripes running down the front of the sweater, matching the pattern seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a figure with a sweater featuring vertical black lines on its front. This appears as a stylized version of a sweater design rather than a direct replication of any pattern shown in the original Image A, which lacks such visible vertical stripes at all. This suggests a creative interpretation rather than an exact match.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is a portion of a light-colored shirt collar visible beneath the sweater’s neckline, aligned with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there is no visible light-colored shirt collar beneath the sweater neckline. The lack of a shirt collar in Image B contrasts with the typical indication of layers or undershirts, which might be assumed from the attire depicted in the original Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the eyes, nose, and forehead lines maintain their original relative positions and shapes, such as the horizontal creases on the forehead and the oval shape of the eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face in Image B is blurred, preventing a detailed analysis of the specific positions and shapes of facial features like eyes, nose, or forehead lines. Therefore, it’s not possible to confirm if they preserve characteristics such as horizontal creases or specific shapes present in the original image.",
      "weight": 2,

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the sweater’s neckline and shoulder area textured with ribbed patterns consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the blurred area might obscure some details, visible parts of the neckline and shoulders in Image B show a figure whose sweater appears to carry a simple design with the character's simplified art style, rather than detailed ribbed pattering. Given the non-detailed, caricatured style in this toy figure, its patterning doesn’t likely match the original image.",
