      "question": "Does the image retain the cylindrical, elongated shape of the baseball bats?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the baseball bats are illustrated with a cylindrical and elongated shape typical of baseball bats. Although the image is a drawing, the form is consistent with what is seen in the real-world counterpart. Despite the artistic style, the bats are depicted with noticeable length and a gradual tapering towards the handle, similar to Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the black taped handles of the bats still distinctly visible against the wooden shafts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the bats with dark-colored handles separate from the lighter wooden shafts. Despite the artistic transformation, this distinct contrast between the handle and the body of the bats has been retained in comparison to Image A, where the real bats also have clear dark handles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the two baseball bats remain parallel to each other in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two bats are visualized as lying parallel to each other, just like in a real-world setting or in Image A. This alignment follows the conventional positioning used in imagery featuring bats lying next to one another.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the bats still placed on a grassy surface, indicating an outdoor setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the baseball bats are shown resting on a surface depicted with shades and textures that suggest grass, indicative of an outdoor environment. This is consistent with Image A, where the bats sit on a clearly grassy lawn.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bats maintain their slight angle toward the viewer, preserving perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the bats from a perspective where they slightly angle toward the viewer, similar to Image A. This angle creates a foreshortening effect common in perspective drawing that adds dimensionality, which is appropriately maintained in the artistic rendition.",
