      "question": "Is the central carved wooden panel with floral and scrollwork detailing behind the desk present and unaltered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a central carved wooden panel with floral and scrollwork detailing behind the desk. This detailing seems to remain intact, which suggests that it has not been altered from its original state. My reasoning is based on the visibility and intricacy of the carvings, which are consistent with traditional woodwork. In comparison to Image A (the original image), the carved panel is unchanged. Therefore, the panel is present and unaltered.",
