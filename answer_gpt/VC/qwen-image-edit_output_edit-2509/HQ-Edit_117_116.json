      "question": "Are the pink-red feathery flower clusters present in both the foreground and background, positioned on slender green stems?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pink-red feathery flower clusters are visible both in the foreground and background. They are depicted on slender green stems, suggesting continuity in the placement from depth perception commonly used in artistic depictions to imply distance and layer.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a clear, symmetrical reflection of the dragonfly visible on the water surface directly beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a dragonfly; instead, there is a different figure with a blurred face. Thus, a reflection of a dragonfly cannot be seen on the water surface.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water surface appears calm, reflecting the figure above. While the sparkling particles are not as clearly distinguished as in typical reflections, there is a smooth reflective quality to the water surface.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a different figure hovering above the water surface, not a dragonfly. The positioning of the figure is central and elevated above the water, but not specifically parallel as described.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a diffused light source casting a glow through the foliage, contributing to the overall ambiance of the scene. The glow is not distinctly golden but has an ethereal quality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there slender green stems and leafy structures extending from the water, supporting the pink-red flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stems and leafy structures are visible, extending and supporting the pink-red flowers. Their position suggests they rise from or are near the water, contributing to the sceneâ€™s composition.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the background composed of blurred green foliage with visible patches of sunlight filtering through?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
