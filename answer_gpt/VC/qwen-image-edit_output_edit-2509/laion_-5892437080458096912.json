      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a blurred facial area, making it impossible to discern specific facial features such as eyes, nose, and mouth that were described in the original image (Image A). Therefore, the subject's facial features cannot be preserved in the same position and form.",

      ],

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hands have a distinctive position and holding style, with one hand resting on a textile or clothing feature, consistent with the positioning in Image A; thus, the hands are preserved in their relative placement.",

      "is_correct": false
