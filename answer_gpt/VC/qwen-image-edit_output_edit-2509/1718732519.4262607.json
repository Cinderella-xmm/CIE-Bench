      "question": "Is the hot dog represented as an elongated, straight object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hot dog is created using building blocks, typically resembling LEGO bricks. These blocks form a rectangular, elongated shape, with the 'bun' and 'sausage' being straight and block-like. This construction results in an appearance that is consistent with the characteristics of an elongated, straight object, albeit blocky in texture. Thus, based on the use of blocks to construct the hot dog, it can be interpreted as elongated and straight.",

      "question": "Is the hot dog placed horizontally on the wooden base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hot dog, made from blocks, is placed longways across the wooden platform directly in front of it. Its orientation is horizontal, meaning the longer sides run parallel to the edges of the base it is on. This placement indicates a horizontal orientation relative to the viewing angle, which is a common presentation style for hot dogs on boards.",

      "question": "Are both the hot dog and the bottle placed on a flat wooden surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows both the bottle, made of colorful building blocks, and the block-constructed hot dog placed on a wooden table. Despite the bottle's shape being more traditional, it shares the flat wooden surface with the hot dog. This suggests that both items rest on a singular plane, which appears to be a wooden surface, common for table settings.",

      "question": "Is the bottle positioned to the left of the hot dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the block-built bottle is positioned on the left side of the scene as per the viewer's perspective, with the hot dog on the right. The bottle's colorful block construction is on the left side of the wooden table, distinctly differing from the hot dog on the right side. This spatial arrangement places the bottle to the left of the hot dog.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the hot dog placed on a raised wooden platform distinct from the main table surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hot dog appears to rest on a small elevated wooden platform or board that is separate from the main surface of the table. This is identified by the visual distinction between the main table surface and the smaller, rectangular block under the hot dog, indicative of a raised cutting board or serving tray. This suggests that the hot dog is on a distinct platform.",
