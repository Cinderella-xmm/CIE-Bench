    "Question": "Q1: Are the emerald-green gemstones present in the same oval-cut shape and vibrant green color as in the original necklace?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible necklace to assess the shape and color of emerald-green gemstones. Instead, a curved lime-green tail is the focal point. Therefore, there's no basis for evaluating emerald gemstones in Image B.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the necklace made of metal with a darkened, oxidized silver finish, showing visible contrast in the engraved details?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not feature a necklace but instead shows a glass dome with a chandelier and green scenery inside. Hence, there is no observable metal necklace to evaluate in terms of an oxidized silver finish.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the necklace retain the complex symmetrical scrollwork and decorative floral patterns throughout its structure?",
    "explanation": "There is no necklace present in Image B for analysis; the content inside the dome focuses on other elements such as the chandelier and snake tail. As such, there can't be an analysis of scrollwork or patterns from a necklace.",

}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the small white gemstones still present in their original positions around the larger emerald stones?",

    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the snake tail maintain its original curved path wrapping around the left side of the mannequin's neck?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no mannequin or necklace for a snake tail to wrap around. The tail is positioned within the glass dome setup, detached from any mannequin context.",
    "answer": "No"
