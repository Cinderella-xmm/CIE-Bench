      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figures are depicted wearing outfits, and one of the figures resembles the rider from Image A. The figure is seen wearing a shirt with a light color, which aligns with the beige shirt from Image A. Beige is a common clothing color, often seen as a light, neutral shade, which is conveyed through the pale hue of the shirt in the chibi artwork.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features chibi-style horses, one of which represents the real horse from Image A. The horse in Image B has a light brown coat similar in hue to the original real horse in Image A. Given this style's adaptation, the visual representation maintains the original's brown color in a simplified form.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horses are depicted without intricate details like bridles, focusing on a simplified chibi style. The absence of a bridle in this style reflects the broader characteristic of chibi art, where such details are frequently omitted. Thus, in contrast to the detailed Image A, Image B's chibi horse is not shown with a bridle.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characteristic simplicity of chibi art is evident, with minimal depiction of interactions or accessories like reins. The figures are styled to accentuate cuteness and are not shown holding any reins, unlike the detailed context provided in Image A. This is consistent with chibi representations often forgoing realistic details.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B does not depict an outdoor scene like that in Image A, due to the focus being solely on the chibi characters. The background color is a flat, neutral beige, a common chibi style choice meant to emphasize the characters in the foreground rather than simulate an earthy outdoor atmosphere.",
