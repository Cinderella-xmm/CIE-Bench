        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cow, designed in a cartoonish style, shows a conspicuous large black patch on its left shoulder. This visual feature seems intentional, representing typical Holstein cow markings. The exaggerated and clear design in the cartoon format corroborates the distinct presence of the patch. Therefore, based on the visual evidence, the patch is clearly defined on the cow's left shoulder.",
