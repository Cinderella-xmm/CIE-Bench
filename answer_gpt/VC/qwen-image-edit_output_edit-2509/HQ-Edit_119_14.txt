    "Question": "Q1: Is the full white beard present on the figureâ€™s face?",
    "explanation": "The image provides a view of a figure dressed in classic period attire with a top hat and formal suit, standing confidently. Given the figure's attire and posture, the presence of a full white beard would be distinctive around the facial area below the top hat.
