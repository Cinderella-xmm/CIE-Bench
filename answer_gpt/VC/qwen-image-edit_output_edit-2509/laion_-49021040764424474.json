        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vehicle is a toy model representing a pickup truck, commonly resembling the Ford Ranger Wildtrak. While it captures certain design aspects, the model does not have distinct brand markings or badges due to its scale and nature as a toy.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction is of a toy model of a pickup truck. The tailgate in this toy vehicle model is not visibly open or lowered, which differs from the real truck functionality. Based on the visual information from the toy model, the tailgate is in a closed position and does not show an exposed truck bed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a toy model that represents a pickup truck with basic design mimicking a real-world vehicle. The model shows two separate segments indicating the front and rear doors on each side of the toy, illustrating a double-cab design, which typically includes front and rear passenger doors. Therefore, based on the details, there are indeed two rear doors visible on the passenger side.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the toy model's rear lights do not display an accurate detailing of real truck taillights due to the scale and design limitations. Specifically, there isn't enough detail in the toy model to discern any color distinction or orientation accurately. Thus, based on the available visual cues, the rear taillights do not have a discernible vertical orientation with different color sections.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toy model is designed to mimic a real pickup truck, and it includes a feature on top of the cab that resembles a roof rack. This is seen as small, black angular components affixed to the top, reflecting the presence of a roof rack.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, we can see that the toy model features black elements parallel to the edges of the windows and seams that would correspond to the bed's border, typical in real pickup truck designs to emulate trim and contours. This detail indicates the presence of black trim running along these areas.",
