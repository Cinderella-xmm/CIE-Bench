      "question": "Is the blouse depicted in deep purple with silver floral embroidery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blouse appears to be in a deep purple color. There is visible silver embroidery, but when considering world knowledge about traditional attire and the artistic design style of the image, the emphasis appears to be on the overall colorful floral design instead of purely silver floral embroidery, suggesting the design aims to simplify and stylize for a chibi representation.",

      "question": "Does the lehenga feature vertical silver paisley motifs and a red inner lining at the hem?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lehenga shows floral patterns and is stylized with vibrant colors typical in chibi art, which simplifies details. The design overall suggests it differs significantly from paisley motifs and the realistic appearance shown in Image A, as it tends toward colorful depiction by emphasizing variations in hues and simplified motifs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From the visual cues present in Image B, the dupatta shows a red color. Although it maintains the appearance of a border that suggests embroidery or design elements, the star-like details are not distinctly visible in the depiction, suggesting the design is simplified in its artistic representation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes artistic simplification typical in chibi designs. The jewelry pieces include designs that suggest a prominence of maang tikka and earrings, however, the details of pearl earrings aren't distinctly illustrated. The stylization represents jewelry impression, but not specific detailed items like pearl-centered pieces.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a depiction of accessories surrounding the wrist, yet when analyzing through world knowledge, such representation is often abstract in chibi art. They depict an impression without highlighting multiple details like individual silver bangles.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is visibly different from the realistic style in Image A; it uses a simplified stylized representation reflecting cartoon-like aesthetics in chibi art, showing minimalistic backgrounds rather than complex damask designs visible in classical wallpaper styles.",
