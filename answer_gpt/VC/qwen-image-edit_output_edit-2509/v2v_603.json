      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we can observe that the person on the left is wearing a red jacket and the person on the right is wearing a blue jacket.

      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both individuals are clearly holding ski poles and are positioned on long, narrow boards that resemble skis beneath their feet. This setup is typical for skiing activities, indicating that the skis and poles are attached to them. Consequently, the answer is 'Yes'.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, both skiers have visible backpacks strapped to their backs. The backpacks appear dark in color, likely black based on the visual darkness and typical backpack color choices. Thus, the answer is 'Yes'.",

        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a snowy forest setting. Snow covers the trees' branches, and a pervasive fog adds to the atmosphere. This depiction aligns with common snowy, foggy forest environments. So, the answer is 'Yes'.",

        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both skiers are seen side by side, facing away from the viewer's perspective and toward the foggy forest. This orientation suggests they are indeed moving forward into the forest, typical behavior for cross-country skiing. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.",
