      "question": "Is the dog's fur primarily white with distinct sandy-colored spots on the ears and face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is depicted with primarily white fur, as seen on the body and legs. However, there are noticeable sandy-colored spots visible on the legs. This suggests that the dog's fur pattern includes sandy-colored spots, although the spots on the ears and face are not visible due to edits. Common knowledge suggests that dogs can have various fur patterns, including spots. Given the visual cues in Image B, the description matches the characteristic of having white fur with sandy spots.",

      "question": "Does the dog have a rounded head with pointed ears and a short muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, we observe that the dog's silhouette provides an impression of a rounded head with pointed ears, which appear to stand erect. These features are commonly associated with certain breed characteristics. Although the muzzle is not visible, dogs with pointed ears and a rounded head often do have shorter muzzles. Based on this reasoning, the answer would be supported by the dog’s general shape and alignment, despite the edited parts.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible indication of black rectangular sunglasses with dark lenses. The dog’s facial area is blurred, eliminating any possibility of seeing sunglasses. Visually, there is no evidence of sunglasses in the area relevant for this inquiry.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the dog seated with its body erect and legs positioned in a manner consistent with facing forward. The posture and alignment indicate a forward-facing position, which is a common sitting position for dogs and aligns with this question's criteria.",

      "question": "Does the dog have a compact body with short legs and a fluffy tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual information from Image B illustrates a dog with a compact body stature. The legs appear short relative to the body, and there is an implication of a fluffy tail, as commonly observed in breeds with plush fur. Combining this with the common dog breed traits leads to the conclusion that Image B does represent such physical characteristics.",
