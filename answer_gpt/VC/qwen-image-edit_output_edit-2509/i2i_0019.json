      "question": "Does the figurine retain the elephant's large ears and trunk as part of its general silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, analyzing the shape and proportions of the figurine shows the familiar features of an elephant such as large ears and a distinct trunk.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B shows the elephant with a green element near its mouth area, which resembles the grass from Image A. This suggests that the figurine is styled to look like it is holding grass with its trunk.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B is predominantly grey, which corresponds to the typical color of elephants. However, the ear area does not visibly have a distinct brownish tone, indicating a possible simplification in color scheme in the edit.",
