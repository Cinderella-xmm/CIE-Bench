      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects in question are Russian nesting dolls, characterized by their traditional colorful designs and floral patterns, not clothing.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Russian nesting dolls are fixed objects and typically devoid of any movable parts or accessories such as a cloth.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a scenic backdrop with a sunset view. The sun is low in the sky, near the horizon, casting warm colors that are typical of ocean or beach sunsets. By common understanding, a setting where the sun meets the waterline over the sea often signifies a sunset on a beach.",
