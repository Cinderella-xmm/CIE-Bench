      "question": "Is the central tower of the fortress composed of multiple stacked, progressively smaller rectangular tiers forming a stepped pyramid shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central structure of the fortress rises with a series of layers or tiers that get progressively smaller as they ascend, resembling the architectural style of a stepped pyramid seen in certain historical buildings, where each layer is smaller than the one below. This architectural style is often used to signify grandeur or importance, and it's visually evident in the edited image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there regular, alternating tooth-like projections (crenellations) along the upper edges of the fortress walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the walls of the fortress are outlined by a series of evenly spaced, rectangular, protruding structures along the top edges. These resemble crenellations, which are typical defensive structures found in castle or fortress architecture, intended for battlements.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a prominent arched opening located at the lower front section of the fortress, serving as a main entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a distinct, large arched opening located at the lower front section of the fortress. This visual cue indicates a main entrance, commonly designed in fortresses for access while maintaining a fortified structure.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the waterfall originate from a gap in the cliff face directly beneath the fortress wall and cascade downward into the river below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waterfall is depicted as emerging from underneath the structure of the fortress itself, flowing over the edges and creating a cascading water effect into a pool or river below. This gives the illusion that the water is sourced from underneath the fortress, enhancing the exotic and fantastical elements of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the fortress situated on a raised cliff overlooking a river that flows through a narrow canyon below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fortress is positioned prominently above ground level, but since it rests on a plate, it gives a whimsical representation rather than an actual geographical feature. The base is elevated, though not in line with a traditional cliff, overlooking a cleverly designed river made of fondant or icing.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, green decorative elements resembling shrubs and trees are crafted with icing around the fortress. These are meticulously styled to mimic clusters of vegetation which would traditionally surround a riverbank or steep terrain in a natural setting, providing a visually lush environment.",
