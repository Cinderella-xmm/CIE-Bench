    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the distinctive curved shape and brown-spotted texture of the bananas?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image features a circular design with a stylized depiction of a car and a watchtower-like structure in bright, solid colors, primarily blue, yellow, and white. There is no depiction of any bananas or any object that resembles the shape or texture of bananas. The image is abstract and focuses on symbolic representation rather than realistic details like in Image A, which presumably depicts bananas with their characteristic features. Thus, the edited image does not contain any elements related to bananas.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the chocolate chips represented as small, round, and dark brown in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "Image B is an abstract illustration that does not depict any chocolate chips or food items in realistic form. The image focuses on symbolic and simplified shapes in bright contrasting colors such as blue and yellow. There are no details that could represent chocolate chips.

    "Question": "Q3: Are the butter chunks shown as small, pale yellow cubes in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "Image B employs a stylized, abstract design without any realistic depiction of items such as butter chunks. The elements present are geometric and symbolic, like a watchtower and car, within a circular frame, with color blocks rather than realistic textures or shapes. Image A, on the other hand, would have shown butter chunks with detail, but such elements are absent in the edited abstract illustration of Image B.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the flour depicted as a fine, white powder contained within a bowl in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not contain any form resembling a bowl or flour; instead, it consists of symbolic icons with solid colors used for a watchtower and car against a blue background. The concept of depicting flour in a realistic form does not align with the abstract representation style of Image B. Image A might have shown such detailed food preparation items, but Image B is void of such minutia.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the stainless steel kitchen mixer present in the background of the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of kitchen appliances such as a stainless steel kitchen mixer. The image is thematic, focusing on abstract symbols instead of realistic objects. There are no such elements present that resemble any real-world kitchen equipment or backgrounds that would be found in a kitchen setting, unlike those possibly shown in Image A or represented by typical mixer shapes and forms.",
    "answer": "No"
