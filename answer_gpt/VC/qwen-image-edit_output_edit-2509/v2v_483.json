      "question": "Is there a handheld fan with a circular blade structure being held in the manâ€™s right hand, directed toward the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a handheld fan can be seen in the man's right hand. The fan has a distinct circular blade structure, typical of many portable fans designed to enhance airflow. This positioning of the fan suggests its purpose is to interact with the objects in front of it, such as the cake.",

      "question": "Are there exactly seven candles on the cake, with visible flames and smoke rising from them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a cake with seven candles placed on top. Each candle has a visible flame, indicating they are lit. Additionally, the imagery suggests smoke rising from these candles, contributing to the festive atmosphere. Such details are often included to enhance the visual appeal and realism of celebratory scenarios.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, smoke can be seen rising from the lit candles on the cake. Smoke is a common visual effect accompanying burning candles, especially when air interacts or attempts to extinguish the flame. This element adds authenticity to the scene as expected in real-life birthday settings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show the man leaning forward with his mouth puckered as if blowing air toward the cake. Instead, he holds a fan, which suggests he is using it to blow air toward the cake rather than directly using his breath.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake is indeed placed on a white plate, as typically used for serving cakes to contrast and enhance visibility. However, the surface underneath the plate appears to be ambiguous in nature; it is not explicitly wooden due to the graphic illustration's design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handheld fan in Image B is held in a way that its airflow direction aligns with the candles on the cake. The fan points towards the cake, indicating an intention to target the candle flames, which is consistent with the scene portraying an innovative approach to blowing out candles.",
