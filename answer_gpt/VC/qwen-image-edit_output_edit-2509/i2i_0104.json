      "question": "Does the image retain the orange tabby fur pattern with distinctive stripe markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image B, the portion of the kitten's body that is visible still shows a clear orange tabby fur pattern. Tabby cats typically have distinctive stripe markings, and the visible part of the kitten's fur suggests that these markings remain present. The analysis focuses on the visible fur outside the blurred region.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the kitten's eyes still green with a clear, open expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image B has a blurred section where the kitten's face should be, so the eyes are not visible. Therefore, without visual cues, the eye color and expression cannot be determined.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the kitten's pink nose and surrounding white whiskers present and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The area where the kitten's nose and whiskers would be visible is blurred in image B. Without visual cues from the unblurred part of the image, the presence and details of the nose and whiskers cannot be confirmed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the kitten's paws and overall body positioning outside the blurred section suggest it is indeed lying down. The visible paws appear to be stretched forward, consistent with a relaxed lying position.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in image B remains softly blurred, which helps maintain the focus on the visible parts of the kitten. This technique is often used in photography to accentuate the subject.",
