      "question": "Are the glass cups transparent and maintain their cylindrical shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass cups appear transparent, which is evident from the way the light passes through them and how the contents are visible. The shape of the cups is discernibly cylindrical, as seen from the circular top and the straight sides consistent with a cylindrical form. This matches common characteristics of cylindrical glass cups.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the beverage inside the cups retain its brown color and smooth texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The beverage in Image B appears brown, as indicated by the uniform brown color that fills the cups. The surface of the beverage looks smooth, evident from the lack of visible disruptions or textures on the liquid surface. This suggests consistency with how a typical hot beverage like coffee or tea appears.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the steam visibly rising above the cups in a natural manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, steam can be seen rising from the cups, which is depicted as wispy and curling upwards naturally. This appearance aligns with how steam behaves in reality, where hot liquid emits steam in visible curls when it is significantly warmer than the surrounding air.",

      "question": "Do the cups sit firmly on the wooden surface, showing their shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cups in Image B are placed on a wooden table, and they cast shadows that follow the direction of light. The shadows are visible and grounded, suggesting that the cups are indeed sitting stably on the surface of the table.",

    {

      "question": "Does the image retain a warm tone, highlighted by the steam and beverages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features warm lighting, evident from the sunlight or light source coming from the direction of the cabin and covering the scene with a warm glow. The brown beverage and visible steam also contribute to this warm tone by adding associations of heat and coziness. The overall environment, including the sun-kissed snow, provides a contrast that enhances the visual warmth of the scene.",
