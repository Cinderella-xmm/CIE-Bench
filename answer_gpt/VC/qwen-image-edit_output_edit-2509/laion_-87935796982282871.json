      "question": "Are the red, gray, and navy blue sections of the comforter present in the edited image, preserving their original color distribution?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the comforter is visually a plush, furry material with a camouflage-like pattern in green, teal, and rust colors. This pattern does not resemble the red, gray, and navy blue distribution present in Image A's comforter. By examining the textures and colors, it's clear that they significantly differ between the two images.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the small square plaid pillow (with red, navy, and white checks) still present on the bed, positioned near the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no small square plaid pillow with red, navy, and white checks is visible on the bed. Instead, the bed features prominent additions like furry ears and a tail, indicating a theme change, which likely led to the removal of the original plaid pillow seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Do the pillows remain positioned on top of the comforter, maintaining their original stacking order and placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows no evidence of the pillows seen in Image A. The furry headboard with ears takes the central space above the comforter, suggesting a complete rearrangement or replacement of bedding accessories, deviating from Image A's pillow placement.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, a light gray shag rug can be seen beneath the bed. The texture and placement suggest consistency between the two images.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black tripod floor lamp with a white drum shade is present and positioned in the same spot to the left of the bed in both images, maintaining its original placement.",
