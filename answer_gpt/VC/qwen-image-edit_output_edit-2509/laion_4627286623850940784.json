      "question": "Is the pointed conical hat with a wide brim present on the gnome’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging shows an illustration of the gnome with clear lines depicting its features. The illustration includes a representation of the gnome wearing a pointed conical hat with a wide brim, which is a typical characteristic of gnomes in folklore. This visual information, combined with the common understanding of garden gnome designs, indicates that the gnome does have such a hat.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the gnome have a full, vertically striated beard extending from the chin down to the chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the illustration on the gnome packet provides enough detail to suggest that the gnome depicted has a long beard with striations. This is aligned with the traditional depiction of gnomes, which often includes a long, full beard that covers the chest area. This belief is reinforced by the use of textural elements in the drawing to represent the beard's strands.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the gnome in a seated position with bent knees and a forward-facing upper body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the graphic depiction on the packet portrays the gnome in what appears to be a seated position, as indicated by the orientation of its body and legs. The knees seem to be bent, and the body is facing forward, which suggests a seated posture typically seen in garden gnomes designed for stability when placed in outdoor settings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the gnome have small, oval-shaped eyes, a broad nose, and a closed smiling mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration found on the Garden Gnome packet in Image B conveys facial features that loosely resemble those in traditional representations of garden gnomes. These typically include small, oval-shaped eyes, a broad nose, and a mouth that is subtly smiling. The simplified drawing style might not emphasize all these facial details clearly, but common gnome imagery aligns with these features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the gnome’s feet shaped like round boots with visible stitching details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The picture of the gnome on the packet in Image B suggests that the gnome's feet are depicted in a simplistic, boot-like form. However, due to the illustration's basic, line-drawn style, specific stitching details on the boots are not discernible. Despite this, the presence of boot shapes, common to garden gnome art, indicates the design intent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the gnome uniformly colored in a warm, sandy beige tone with textured surface variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gnome is shown on packaging as an illustration without color. Therefore, no uniform coloration can be observed. This illustration contrasts with color photography's capabilities and only provides a monochromatic view, which does not exhibit any textures or varied surface colors.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the left hand raised and positioned as if holding an object, while the right hand rests near the lower body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the graphical representation of the gnome does not provide enough detail or positioning of its hands that reflects a specific pose or action, such as holding an object. The basic drawing style limits understanding of individual hand positions, which would typically assist in conveying actions like holding.",
