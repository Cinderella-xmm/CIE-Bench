      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there exactly eight upright objects arranged in a tight vertical cluster within the container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon examining the tight vertical arrangement within the transparent container, I counted the upright objects. These objects are decorated with facets resembling gemstones in various colors. Using common sense and visual assurance, I confirmed there are precisely eight such items. Hence, the answer is clear.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a bed of small, uniformly shaped spherical objects filling the lower portion of the container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower portion can be fully examined through the clear container. It contains no small, uniformly shaped spherical particles. In Image A, the container base is filled with pearls, but Image B lacks any such elements, indicating a change. Thus, the answer is clear.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a decorative band located precisely at the upper rim of the container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the container features a decorative lace-like band that wraps around, forming a bow. The visual perception confirms the band aligns with the upper rim area. This detail is prominent and clear, leading to a precise answer.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the container transparent, allowing full visibility of the contents inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a container through which the contents are clearly visible. Transparency reveals the upright objects and decorative lace, providing unobstructed visibility. Thus, using visual information combined with common sense, it is evident that this transparency condition is met.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all the objects positioned vertically, with their tips pointing upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each contained item is placed in an upright position, with tips resembling colored stones pointing upward. Visual evaluation of the arrangement shows consistency in vertical positioning. Thus, using visual clues, the conclusion is affirmative.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there at least three distinct sizes of objects visible in the cluster (large, medium, small)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B and the cluster arrangement, it seems all objects are of similar size in their placement and design. Comparing this with visual cues in Image A, which portrays makeup brushes with varying sizes, Image B's uniformity negates the presence of diverse object sizes. Hence, recognizing this uniformity, the answer is clear.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the container resting on a flat, horizontal surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B reveals the container placed on a glass table, ensuring flat horizontal support. The clear stance and balance of the objects inside reinforce horizontal alignment. This consistent visual positioning ensures confidence in the answer.",
