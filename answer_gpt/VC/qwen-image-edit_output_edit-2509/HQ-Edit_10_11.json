      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the gorilla depicted in a seated pose with its left hand resting under its chin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, I observe a seated figure resembling a gorilla with its left hand positioned under its chin, which is consistent with a thoughtful pose. This analysis is based on the visual representation of the figure, where the hand is visibly in contact with the chin area.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the gorilla have a prominent brow ridge, wide nose, and strong jawline consistent with a silverback gorilla?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B is carved in a stylized manner where specific facial features, including brow ridge, nose, and jawline, might be generalized or simplified due to the artistic representation. A detailed examination indicates that while it represents a gorilla shape, the specific features of a silverback gorilla aren't distinctly emphasized.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a distinct patch resembling a silver saddle located across the back and shoulders of the gorilla?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla is depicted as a wooden carving. It doesn't showcase any coloration or distinct patches like the natural fur of a silverback gorilla would have, particularly the silver saddle.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the gorilla positioned on a horizontal surface that resembles a log or platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the gorilla seated on what appears to be a stylized wooden log, evident from the shape and texture that mimic wood grain, indicating that the figure is on a horizontal surface.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the gorilla’s right arm resting on its right knee?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the gorilla's right arm resting on its knee, which is demonstrated by the placement of the arm parallel to the bent knee, confirming this pose.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the gorilla’s gaze directed forward and slightly downward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla’s gaze is hidden due to the facial blur. However, based on the pose and position—head slightly bent down with the hand supporting—one can infer a downward gaze aligning with a contemplative posture.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there leaf-shaped elements present in the background, even if stylized or etched?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does include stylized or etched leaf-shaped elements in the background, which are recognizable from the carved patterns and forms embellished in the wooden design.",
