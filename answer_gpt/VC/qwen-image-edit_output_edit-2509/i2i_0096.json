      "question": "Is the sofa still black with multiple cushions evenly arranged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sofa appears to be black, as suggested by the dark hue, and it is seen with multiple cushions, indicating additional support and comfort. The cushions are uniformly placed, which suggests an intentional design choice for symmetry or aesthetics. This is consistent with the setup in Image A.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the painting is positioned directly above the sofa, maintaining a central focus in the arrangement. This alignment indicates a consistent placement relative to the sofa, similar to what is observed in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the wall behind the sofa in a light tone, likely a shade of white or cream. Neutral light colors are typically used to create a sense of openness and contrast with darker furniture, such as the black sofa. This analysis aligns with the neutral tones observed in Image A.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible sunlight effects or shadows on the wall behind the sofa, as the lighting appears uniform without indications of directional sunlight. This contrasts with Image A, which shows sharp sunlight patterns suggesting window proximity.",
