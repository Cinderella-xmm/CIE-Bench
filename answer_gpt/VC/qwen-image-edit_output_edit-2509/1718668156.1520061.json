    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the amber-colored liquid visible in the short glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the short glass is visible containing a liquid. The liquid appears to have a reddish tint, suggesting it might be amber-colored. This inference is supported by the red hue visible within the container when combining the visual cue with knowledge about how light can affect liquid appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is a yellow straw inserted into the short glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a short glass with a straw inserted into it. The straw appears to have a reddish glow rather than yellow, reflecting the neon style of the image where colors can be perceived differently due to lighting effects. Given these attributes, the straw doesn't display a yellow color.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are ice cubes visible within the short glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The short glass in Image B shows design patterns reminiscent of ice cubes within the neon framework. This design suggests textured ice cubes being present, influenced by effects promoting a glowing pattern often seen in neon art.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tall glass completely filled with ice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tall glass has a neon design where the illuminated parts suggest it being full of ice in a stylistic manner. This luminescent depiction indicates the glass appears filled with neon patterned ice cubes simulating texture throughout its height.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sail-like shells of the Sydney Opera House visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays structures with distinct geometry reminiscent of the iconic sails of the Sydney Opera House, albeit stylized in a vibrant neon illustration. The visual cue matches the common perception of the Opera House designs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a stone ledge beneath the two glasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a stone ledge; instead, the foreground features a patterned surface consistent with neon styling. This contrasts with the expected texture and appearance of a stone ledge, leaning towards virtual or art deco design elements.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the two glasses positioned side by side on the ledge, with the short glass on the left and the tall glass on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, the arrangement follows a positioning where the short glass is on the left and the tall glass is on the right side by side. This corresponds to conventional spatial arrangements often seen in similar compositions.",
