        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the NASA logo is prominently visible on the left shoulder of the space suit.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a space suit design that includes red trim bands on both the upper arm and the lower leg sections of the suit. The red bands serve as a visual contrast and are often used in spacesuits for identification or stylistic purposes.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, it is clear that the suit has a white backpack unit attached to the back. This unit is integral to a space suit, commonly housing life support systems. There are coiled white hoses extending down the sides, indicating connections between the backpack and the suit, which are essential for oxygen delivery and other life-support functions.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visor of the helmet appears closed, and there is no portion of the astronaut's face visible due to the editing blur effect over the face. Typically, if a visor is raised, it would reveal facial features but in this scenario, it is edited not visible.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "An analysis of Image B shows that the astronaut is standing upright with a posture suggesting orientation to the right side. The visual positioning of the suit and its components align vertically and directionally to the right side of the image.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon reviewing Image B, it is observable that there are hoses from the backpack unit that connect to the suit at the torso area. This is consistent with standard spacesuit designs, where such connections are critical for proper functioning of the life-support systems.",
