      "question": "Is the fountain located at the exact center of the garden layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fountain is replaced by a feature with cascading water and glowing crystals, located within the design of the garden. The visual balance and symmetry imply the fountain is still at the gardenâ€™s center, a common central feature in elaborate garden designs. This placement ensures symmetry and visual appeal.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the hedges and flowerbeds form a symmetrical radial pattern centered on the fountain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the layout of hedges and paths continues to reflect symmetry with circular and radial designs around the central water feature. This continues the visual style of organized garden patterns recognizable in formal garden design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the garden is characterized by fantastical elements like giant green figures and glowing crystals. There is no indication of a traditional arched gateway visible as part of the composition.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is surrounded by surreal elements such as towering green figures, and there are no visible houses or thatched roofs beyond the garden area. This environment is more fantastical compared to a traditional landscape view.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground features lush pink roses in the lower part of the image. These flowers appear prominently and are integrated into the garden's composition, resembling the closest view to the observer.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there purple lavender plants arranged in a ring around the base of the fountain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central fountain area is populated with glowing crystals rather than traditional plants. The garden design deviates from tangible flora arrangements like lavender rings commonly found in traditional gardens.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, these tall figures resemble exaggerated topiary shapes, not traditional trees. They are adorned with floral elements and possess distinct features that add a surreal aesthetic, contributing to a fantasy theme.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backdrop is dominated by fantastical vertical elements and cloudy sky without a discernible horizon separating land and sky. This creates an ethereal and otherworldly atmosphere.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surreal theme deviates significantly from the original garden layout. While pink roses appear prominently, red tulips and lavender aren't distinctly present in recognizable forms or positions from Image A, as fantastical features dominate the scene.",
