      "question": "Are the refrigerators depicted with a stainless steel finish and reflective surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows three refrigerators that all have a uniform stainless steel finish, which is commonly recognized by its silver, slightly shiny, and reflective surface. This is evident from the visual cues provided, as stainless steel is known for its clean and modern appearance. All the refrigerators in Image B display these attributes, with no variations in surface material or color.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do both refrigerators retain the double-door design with water/ice dispensers located on the freezer compartments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the middle and right refrigerators clearly have double doors with visible water/ice dispensers integrated into the doors, suggesting these are the freezer compartments. This setup is consistent with standard side-by-side refrigerator designs where dispensers are typically located on the freezer side. The left refrigerator lacks a dispenser, indicating it might be a full fridge unit without a freezer. The initial assessment did not specify 'both' as clear, but collectively two of the three exhibit this feature, aligning with typical expectations.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the refrigerators displayed in their original proportions and sizes relative to each other, without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the refrigerators side by side, and their consistent proportions and alignment suggest there is no apparent distortion. The refrigerators are typically built to standard sizes and proportions for aesthetic and functional reasons. The visual observation reveals consistent size and shape across all units, which does not indicate any distortion from what might be original proportions.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the control panels and water/ice dispensers positioned correctly on the freezer doors, consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dispensers on the middle and right refrigerators located on the left door, consistent with typical side-by-side refrigerators having their ice/water dispensers on the freezer compartment door. Without direct access to Image A initially, the consistent placement of dispensers on Image B suggests no deviation, indicating correct positioning visually matching general refrigerator designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the cabinets above the refrigerators retain their dark gray shaker-style design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the refrigerators independently, without showing any surrounding cabinetry or environment, which means any cabinet design or color cannot be assessed. Image B does not provide relevant information to assess cabinetry styles or colors as seen in the original Image A.",
