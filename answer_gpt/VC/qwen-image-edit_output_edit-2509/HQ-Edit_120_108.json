      "question": "Is the book physically present and open on the wooden desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book is clearly visible and open on the desk, indicating the presence of a book on the desk. The pages are spread out, showing the interior of the book, which supports the conclusion that the book is physically open. Common sense tells us that an open book will have pages that are visible and not just a closed cover.",

      "question": "Is the ornate brass desk lamp positioned on the left side of the desk, with its arm extended toward the book?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the brass desk lamp is indeed positioned on the left side of the desk and its articulated arm is extended towards the open book, as indicated by the lamp's light falling onto the book. The position of the lamp and the direction of its arm imply intentional placement for optimal lighting on the reading material.",

    {

      "question": "Is the desk made of wood with visible grain texture and located beneath all objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the desk is portrayed as having a wood grain texture, which can be identified by the typical streaks and patterns that wooden surfaces exhibit. The desk forms the base upon which all other objects, such as the books and the lamp, rest, confirming its location beneath them. Wooden desks are often depicted with such grain texture to illustrate their material.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two stacked books clearly on the right side of the desk, with their covers visible and one small closed book identifiable on the left side of the desk. The arrangement is consistent with common book placement, where larger volumes are often stacked for stability.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the lamp emit a focused beam of light that falls directly onto the open book?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lamp's beam is visibly focused, as suggested by the well-lit area directly over the open book. The direction and intensity of the lamp's light suggest that its design is intentional, allowing concentrated light to facilitate reading or highlighting the book.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is characterized by the use of warm brown and gold tones throughout the scene, particularly in the brass lamp and books, with deep blues present on the wall behind. This combination of colors aligns with the typical palette of vintage leather-and-brass aesthetics, where these hues are used to evoke warmth and antiquity.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall behind the desk exhibits a dark teal color complemented with texture detail visible in the form of gears and decorative panels. This textured surface, coupled with the deep hue, contributes to the overall steampunk aesthetic while confirming the wallâ€™s color and surface type.",
