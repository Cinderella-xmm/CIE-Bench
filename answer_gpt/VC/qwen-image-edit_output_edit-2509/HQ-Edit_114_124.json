      "question": "Does the edited image retain the recognizable coastline shape of North and South America, including the Gulf of Mexico and the narrow isthmus of Central America?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the map still shows a coastline that resembles the shape of North and South America.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the map showcases a faint grid of lines that suggest the presence of latitude and longitude markings. This is consistent with the visual style of antique maps and helps to maintain a coherent geographic representation. Therefore, these grid lines are still evident in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B displays a texture that appears to be aged, with visible stains and discolorations similar to those seen in historic maps on parchment. This aging effect gives the map a vintage aesthetic, indicating that such features are preserved in the edited image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the dominant colors are sepia tones combined with gold and green hues, particularly on the compass and background. These tones were present in the original map, and their continuation in the edited version suggests that the color palette has been preserved.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, it is noticeable that the image still includes elements resembling handwritten labels and ship drawings typical of antique maps, though not all elements from the original may be as visible due to the additional elements like scrolls and figures. However, the presence of these elements implies that some script labels or ship illustrations remain.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central compass maintains its position and appearance, with a prominent golden metallic finish and detailed engravings similar to those of a ship's wheel. This suggests that despite transformations, the compass's aesthetic qualities remain consistent with the original.",
