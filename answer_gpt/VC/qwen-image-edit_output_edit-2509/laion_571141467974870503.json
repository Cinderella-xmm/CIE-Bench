      "question": "Is the number \"1423\" clearly visible on the front of the train?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train's front shows a combination of bright colors creating a new pattern, and typical fine details might be obscured due to the artistic editing style. The number '1423' might be harder to distinguish because the pop art effect uses strong outlines and vibrant colors that can obscure small details. However, despite the alteration, the '1423' number shape is faintly recognizable in familiar railroad train design, so if it isn't perfectly clear, it is still identifiably there.",

      "question": "Does the train have two circular headlights below a central white circular light on its front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases bright and atypical colors in pop art style where object details might be exaggerated or diminished. The edited train front seems to maintain recognizability with the traditional design. The placement of elements approximating headlights and a central white light are discernible. Despite the bright and artistic stylization obscuring clear reflections or shadows, their location and shape are consistent with known train illustrations.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there multiple vertical rows of white-framed windows on the side of the barn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the side of the barn displays an array of colorful patterns overlapping basic architecture features typical in pop art design. While it maintains the suggestion of building structure, these patterns preserve identifiable traits like shapes resembling windows. The edited version retains a semblance of vertical alignment where white frame features that would suggest multiple white-framed windows being present.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there two large wooden doors centered on the lower part of the barnâ€™s front facade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a bright and abstract artistic style that might obscure or transform plain wooden details. The barn door is altered with various patterns, disrupting typical visibility clear in architectural imagery. In this stylized version, the areas where large doors might traditionally reside have been divided by vibrant new color regions; thus, no outrightly visible large wooden doors are observable. The front facade's design shifts due to artistic changes, making the presence of wooden doors unclear.",

      "question": "Do the railway tracks extend forward from under the train and curve gently to the right into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while edited with vivid visuals, the train track displays geometric lines consistent with train tracks extending forward from under, maintaining typical railway design visibility. However, specific curvature beyond the edited train region might be too distorted to affirm direct perception as the image effect changes spatial perspective. Therefore, this doesn't distinctly convey a rightward curve due to the dominant art patterns disrupting the extension view.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the yellow triangular warning sign with a blue border and the \"50\" speed limit sign visible near the track on the left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows artistic changes, with familiar sign shapes and colors being present yet abstract. While the altered space still depicts a general sign in the area, a direct match to specific numbers or borders can be obscured and not vividly portrayed due to overpowering visual modification. Therefore, exact identification of '50' and precise border depiction remains questionable.",

      "question": "Is the train positioned directly on the railway tracks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the pop art style of Image B transforming the scene into vibrant stylization, essential placements such as tracks below the train remain logically positioned. The colored artistic enhancement keeps contextually suitable positions for typical elements like trains on tracks, displayed by alignment following typical travel pathways.",
