    "Question": "Q1: Is the trunk of each elephant still curved upward in the same manner as in the original?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not depict elephants but rather perfume bottles with faux elephant-like features, including ears. The trunks in Image A were part of the elephant figurines and curved upward, but in Image B, this feature does not exist. Therefore, the trunks cannot be compared to Image B as they are not present.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the ears of both elephants still present in their original flared shape and position?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottles have golden and blue elements resembling elephant ears, positioned at the top of the bottles. Image A showed flared, large ears on the sides of the elephant faces. The features in Image B are adapted into the bottle caps rather than the sides of the heads.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the oval-shaped mosaic pattern located on the back of each elephant, centered and bordered by gold trim?",
    "explanation": "Image A features elephants with mosaics on their backs, highlighted with gold trim. In Image B, the bottles have a hexagonal blue pattern, and the mosaic is not apparent. Additionally, there's no clear gold trim around a specific mosaic center as there was on the elephants.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do both elephants retain golden-colored tusks positioned near the mouth?",
    "explanation": "Image A exhibited golden tusks on the elephants. In Image B, the concept of elephants has been transformed into bottle shapes without any elephant tusks. Thus, the tusks are no longer present.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a decorative band with scrollwork pattern around the lower body of each elephant?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows perfume bottles that do not have a decorative band around their bases which was present in Image A's elephant figurines. The design did not translate to the bottles.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the eyes of both elephants positioned on the sides of the head and colored dark?",
    "explanation": "The elephants in Image A had side-positioned darkened eyes. Image B's perfumes do not possess any features that resemble eyes; the design has transitioned from animals to bottles with no corresponding facial detail.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the larger elephant positioned to the left and the smaller one to the right, maintaining their original relative size?",
    "explanation": "In Image A, the larger elephant was on the left and the smaller on the right. Image B's design represents this positioning and relative size with larger and smaller perfume bottles, resembling the elephants' former arrangement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
