    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain exactly six wheels arranged in three axles, with the front axle near the cab and two rear axles supporting the cargo body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, it is clear that the vehicle has six wheels, arranged across three axles. The front axle is positioned near the cab, and the two rear axles support the cargo body. This arrangement is consistent with what is often seen in large trucks designed for stability and weight distribution. The visual information from the edited image clearly shows this typical configuration, confirming the presence of six wheels and three axles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the cargo body positioned directly behind the cab, maintaining the same horizontal alignment and proportional length as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the cargo body is indeed positioned directly behind the cab, maintaining a similar horizontal alignment and proportional length, which is characteristic of vehicles that are designed to efficiently utilize space for transporting goods. The consistent positioning and proportion suggest a design that prioritizes symmetry and practical space usage, matching the layout often seen in classical and military transport trucks.",

      "question": "Are there two rectangular windows visible on the side of the cargo body, located approximately one-third and two-thirds along its length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows two rectangular windows on the side of the cargo body. Observing their positions indicates they are strategically placed approximately one-third and two-thirds along the body's length, which is a common pattern for vehicles requiring periodic illumination or ventilation without compromising structural integrity. These windows align with typical manufacturing and design practices for such vehicles, supporting the vehicle's functional design.",

      "question": "Is the vertical slatted grille present on the front of the vehicle, centered between the headlights and aligned with the hood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the truck displays a vertical slatted grille, which is centered between the headlights and appears to align with the hood as seen traditionally on military or vintage vehicles. Such grilles serve essential functions in cooling engine components while offering protection and maintaining aesthetic harmony centered with the vehicle's frontal design. The vehicle in the edited image reflects these design elements and purposes.",

      "question": "Is there a side mirror attached to the driver’s side door, extending outward from the upper portion of the door?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image includes a side mirror on the driver's side door, extending outwardly from its upper portion. Such mirrors are critical for drivers' visibility in large vehicles, providing increased safety by enabling them to see blind spots. This is a traditional placement strategy on trucks to offer maximum range of vision without distracting the driver, confirming alignment with common vehicle construction practices.",

      "question": "Is there a horizontal ladder affixed to the lower side of the cargo body, running parallel to the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there is no horizontal ladder affixed to the lower side of the cargo body. Such a ladder would typically facilitate access to elevated cargo areas in trucks, assisting personnel movements and operations. The absence indicates a potential divergence from designs usually incorporating accessibility features on commercial vehicles, which is notable as it changes utility aspects.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a silver-colored door handle visible on the driver’s side door, positioned midway down the door?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image of the vehicle, the door handle on the driver’s side is not silver but matches the overall crystal-like design of this unique rendition. The absence of a distinct silver handle affects functionality since handles are engagement points for doors, usually located at mid-level for ergonomic access. This variation reflects artistic reinterpretation or style alteration, diverging from typical design.",
