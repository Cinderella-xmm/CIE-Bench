    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the cactus still spherical in overall shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus retains a spherical shape with a consistent curved surface, much like a ball or globe. This is similar to Image A, which originally displayed a spherical cactus. The overall circular contour remains unchanged, indicating that the shape is still spherical.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the vertical ribs of the cactus clearly visible and maintaining their segmented pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vertical ribs of the cactus are distinctly visible and retain the characteristic segmented pattern typical of many cactus varieties. This is observed through the consistent vertical lines running from the top to the bottom of the cactus. The added details and symbols do not obscure the visibility of these ribs but enhance their distinctiveness.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the main body of the cactus still predominantly green in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cactus that remains primarily green, which is the common color for cacti due to the chlorophyll present in their tissue for photosynthesis. Despite the addition of crystalline decorations and glowing symbols, the primary color seen is green.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the cactus positioned vertically and resting on a flat surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the cactus standing upright within a pot, maintaining a vertical posture. The pot rests on a flat surface at the top of what appears to be a stone pedestal, supporting the plant's vertical orientation. This is consistent with Image A, where the cactus was similarly positioned vertically.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a textured, flat surface beneath the cactus container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus is seated on a pedestal, which indicates some elevation and separation from any additional flat surface beneath it. In Image A, the cactus was directly on a wooden surface. Therefore, in Image B, there's no immediate mention or indication of a textured flat surface directly beneath the pot as seen in Image A, implying there isn't one visible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the cactus placed directly above a supporting structure (such as a pedestal or pot)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the cactus in a pot which is placed on top of a stone pedestal, illustrating a support structure. The support structure gives the cactus an elevated position, making it clear that it rests on such a structure.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the light source coming from the upper left, casting shadows toward the lower right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunlight is shown in the upper left corner, similar to Image A, where the light source is illustrated in the same position. The sunlight's position in Image B continues to cast shadows on the objects from upper left to lower right, indicating the consistency of the light source direction.",
