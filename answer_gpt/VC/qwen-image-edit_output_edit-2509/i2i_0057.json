    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the road still present in the image, with the same pathway direction and surface characteristics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the road is clearly visible, maintaining its original direction and surface characteristics as observed from the visual cues. The road's pathway is consistent in perspective and direction with what would be expected if only a digital object was added rather than the background being altered.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the rustic fence still correctly positioned along the edge of the field, dividing it from the road?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fence is still visibly positioned in its original place along the edge of the field. The perspective and arrangement parallel to the road suggest it serves the purpose of division from the road, consistent with the typical function and knowledge of fencing.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the trees still present in their respective places, maintaining the natural backdrop of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B appear to be intact and positioned similarly to how they provide a backdrop in such natural settings. By matching the scene arrangement and consistency with land features, they are in their respective places contributing to the natural setting.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the lighting remain consistent, with similar shadows cast on the road and grass as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B seems consistent with Image A, as similar shadows are visible on both the road and the grass. The consistency of shadows on various elements indicates that the lighting has been preserved or matched closely to the original scene.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the grassy field still visible, with its lush texture and coverage around the road and fence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grassy field in Image B maintains its lush texture and coverage around the road and fence, as observed through the visual cues of dense and evenly spread grass. Such characteristics match typical grassy fields, indicating there are no major alterations.",
