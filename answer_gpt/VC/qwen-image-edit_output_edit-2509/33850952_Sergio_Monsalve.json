      "question": "Are there at least eight distinct horizontal levels stacked vertically along the building facade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building has a design that resembles tentacles and glowing elements. There are distinct horizontal sections visible along the facade, but the count is exactly five based on the visible divisions between the alien-like textures. This can be observed through the glowing lines and the curves separating them. These distinct layers are less than eight. ",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no traditional balconies or transparent railings visible following conventional architectural designs. Instead, the building is characterized by alien-like tentacles and glowing sections, with no definitive human architecture features present.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts an imaginative, organic structure with flowing tentacle-like forms and illuminated sections. There are no traditional windows or discernible arcs one would expect in a human-made building design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure reflects a surreal and fictional design without actual windows or rooms where furniture could be seen. The visual representation leans towards an extraterrestrial or fantasy theme, not showing any interior elements typical to buildings.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The perspective in Image B indeed comes from a low-angle viewpoint, focusing on the upward elongation and surreal curved profile of the fictional structure. The artistic representation with swirling tentacles and light highlights this perspective.",
