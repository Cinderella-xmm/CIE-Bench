    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the vessel positioned in the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vessel, which is depicted as a detailed ornate lamp, is placed prominently but slightly off-center to the right. This is discerned through the placement in relation to the visible proportions of the fabric surface it is resting on.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a circular tray directly beneath the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lamp does not have a circular tray beneath it. Instead, it is directly placed on a richly embellished patterned fabric. This conclusion is drawn by observing the lack of a separate circular item beneath the lamp.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does vapor or smoke originate from the top opening of the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a mystical smoke-like figure emanating from the spout of the lamp, resembling a traditional representation of a genie. This visual cue indicates the presence of smoke or vapor.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the vessel have a conical or upward-tapering shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lamp in Image B has an elongated spout and a bulbous body common to a traditional oil lamp, rather than a conical, upward-tapering shape. This is apparent from the shape of the ornate object itself.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the vessel placed on a flat, patterned fabric surface that covers the visible ground plane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vessel in Image B is indeed placed on a flat, intricately patterned and ornate fabric, confirmed by the extent to which the fabric spans the visible area beneath the lamp.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a small opening at the top of the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a small opening at the top of the lamp from which the smoke or genie emerges, indicating the presence of such an opening.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the tray made of a material visually similar to the vessel (e.g., terracotta)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no visible tray under the lamp in Image B, hence there is no material similarity to compare regarding a tray.",
      "weight": 1,

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fabric beneath the vessel in Image B exhibits an elaborate, structured geometric and ornate pattern, evident through the distinct use of shapes and jewel-like embellishments depicted in the image.",
