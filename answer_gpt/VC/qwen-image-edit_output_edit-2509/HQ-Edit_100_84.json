      "question": "Are there exactly three triangular sails attached to the dhow, arranged in a staggered vertical line?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a dhow with three sails, characterized by their triangular shape and staggered arrangement. World knowledge about dhows informs us that such sailboats typically feature multiple sails in a staggered fashion for optimal wind capture, confirming their vertical alignment. The staggered appearance is visually evident by the positioning of each sail along the height of the mast.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dhow have a wooden hull with visible arched windows and decorative lattice railings along the upper deck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dhow displays ornate characteristics that are consistent with traditional wooden craftsmanship. The hull exhibits arched windows and intricate lattice railing designs, which are common in traditional wooden vessels, especially those used for decorative purposes. Comparing Image A reveals the same features, indicating consistent use and style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the dhow oriented diagonally across the frame, with its bow pointing toward the upper right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dhow is poised diagonally, creating a dynamic perspective within the composition. Its bow directs toward the upper right, implying forward motion or intent of travel. This orientation is confirmed by the position of the sails and the hull, which together suggest movement in the indicated direction. Image A shows the same diagonal orientation, supporting the analysis.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there multiple small sailboats visible on the horizon in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, multiple small sailboats are depicted on the horizon, identifiable by their sails and placement at the waterline's distant edge. World knowledge tells us that such composition aids in evoking a sense of depth and activity within a maritime scene. Image A reflects similar elements, confirming the presence of multiple saoilboats in the background.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sun located low on the left side of the image, casting a bright golden reflection across the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not incorporate the sun on the left; instead, it illustrates a nighttime or evening scene with architectural and mythical elements rather than a natural sunset. Thus, Image B does not feature a sun with a golden reflection. However, Image A includes such an element, confirming the variance between both images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a visible wake and reflection of the dhow beneath its hull on the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, designed to emphasize fantasy elements, does not show actual water movement like the wake of a vessel. The art style prioritizes decorative features over realistic reflections or movement in the water. Image A contrasts this by showing realistic water dynamics with a visible wake, demonstrating the differences between the two images.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the dhow have a long, pointed bow extending forward from the hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dhow exhibits a bow that extends prominently forward, which mirrors traditional dhow designs intended for cutting through water efficiently. The stylized art reinforces this feature through embellishment, consistent with known dhow characteristics. Image A shows a similar bow design, aligning both images in terms of dhow structural elements.",
