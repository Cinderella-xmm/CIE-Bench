      "question": "Is there a cross at the very top of the church's steeple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe the church's steeple, which has a cross situated at its very top. This is a typical architectural feature found in many churches, providing visual confirmation that the cross exists at the peak. Observational detail combined with knowledge about church architecture leads to this conclusion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a glowing arched doorway located at the front center of the church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the doorway of the church is illustrated, but there is no evidence of glowing light emanating from it. The door appears to be closed and not illuminated. By comparing this to common scenes where glowing lights typically signify illumination, the absence of such visual cues suggests the doorway is not glowing.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image B and Image A feature a dirt path leading up to the church entrance. In Image B, this path is visually present as it stretches from the foreground, winding towards the church, indicating consistency with paths often seen leading to buildings in realistic and fantastical settings alike.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, directly above the main entrance there is a large stained-glass window with an arched design. Stained-glass windows are a hallmark of church architecture and visually, the window is large, arched, and located in a prominent position over the entrance of the church.",
