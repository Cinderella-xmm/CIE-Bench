    "Question": "Q1: Does the apple retain its glossy red skin with visible white specks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the apples in both the top left and bottom sections exhibit a shiny red surface with small white specks, which is typical of many apple varieties. This glossy appearance is indicative of a fresh apple. The visual cues, combined with common knowledge that fresh apples often have this appearance, confirm the presence of these features.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Is the short dried stem still present on the apple?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both whole apples (top left and bottom sections) show a short, dried stem protruding from the top. This feature is common in apples and is visible as a small, darker, cylindrical object at the top of the fruit. This observation matches with the expected appearance of an apple's natural stem.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the apple displayed on a wooden surface in all views?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the apples on a surface with a wooden texture and color in all three sections. The grain and color of the surface in each view are consistent with that of wood, a common surface for displaying fruit. This consistent setting is observed across all representations of the apple within the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the apple keep its realistic overall shape and volume in all views?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the apples depicted in both whole views (top left and bottom) maintain a round, symmetrical, and full shape, typical of real apples. The cross-section in the top right maintains this realistic shape by showing a similar outline with an interior that matches an apple's expected internal structure, confirming the retention of shape and volume.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: In the cross-section view, is the apple's flesh texture visible and consistent?",
    "explanation": "In the top right section of Image B, the apple's cross-section clearly shows a smooth, creamy surface typical of apple flesh. The texture appears even and consistent, without any atypical blemishes or irregularities. This matched appearance aligns with the expected texture of an apple's interior, thus confirming its consistency.",
