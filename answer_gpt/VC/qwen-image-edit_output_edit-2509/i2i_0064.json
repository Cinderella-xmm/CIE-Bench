      "question": "Is the text \"REVERE BEACH\" visible on the clock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clock present; however, the subject of the image is a cat, not a clock, and it is within a living room environment. Since 'REVERE BEACH' is associated with clocks, which do not feature prominently in this image, this specific text is not mentioned or visible on any object in the image.",

      "question": "Does the clock face display Roman numerals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses on a cat lounging on a sofa with a remote control, and there is no visible clock in the background or elsewhere that displays Roman numerals. The emphasis on living room decor suggests typical residential elements without any explicit clock detail.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the clock mounted on a tall, ornate metal post?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the primary focus is on an indoor setting with a cat. There are no signs or any indication of an outdoor clock or metal post within this setting. The environment implies nothing of the sort associated with ornate outdoor fixtures.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases an indoor setting, specifically a living room with a cat. This setting does not include an ocean view or a clear sky, as it is an indoor environment with walls and a TV. Consequently, there's no clock against such a backdrop.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scenario presented in Image B is an indoor living setting with a cat. There are no clocks, especially ones oriented clearly toward the viewer, as the main image focus is on domestic life. A viewer-facing clock cannot be identified within this visual.",
