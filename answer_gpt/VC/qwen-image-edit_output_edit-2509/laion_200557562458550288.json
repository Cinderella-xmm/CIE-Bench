        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jersey design visible on the biker seems to feature numerous text elements, but the specific presence of the vertical red 'DALLAS' text on the left side as seen in Image A would require either a small or obscured representation. Given the stylized design and speed effect, it might not be distinctly visible.",
