    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the atomic design retain the three intersecting elliptical orbits with a central nucleus and three electron positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the atomic design depicted demonstrates three intersecting elliptical orbits and appears to have indicative elements representing electrons and the nucleus. This imagery is typical in representations of atomic structures, where electrons orbit around a central nucleus in defined paths. The overall design retains three paths or loops, forming a recognized atomic structure with electron placements along these paths.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the white plastic cookie cutter retaining its original atomic-shaped outline with three elliptical loops and a central nucleus?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the displayed cookie cutters are shown in varying atomic shapes but clearly maintain the characteristic outline featuring elliptical loops and a central nucleus, indicative of atomic structure designs. These loops and central positioning are consistent with representing atomic elements such as electrons and the nucleus visually.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cookie cutter positioned to the left of the atomic imprint, with a partial edge overlap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a layout with various shapes and cookie designs, predominantly atomic-themed. However, the detailed positioning, such as overlapping or specific placement relative to the embossing, is less evident in this composed, informative image. It lacks the specific depiction of spatial relationships like in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the atomic imprint in the dough have clean, continuous edges without breaks or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of dough or atomic imprints. Rather, the focus is on decorated cookies and cutters with clear atomic designs. The lack of a dough imprint means there is no assessment available regarding edge clarity or continuity.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a small central hole in the nucleus area of the atomic imprint?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction in Image B shows completed cookies and related atomic designs but does not specifically present details like small holes within imprints or nucleus areas. The images provide illustrative cookie designs rather than showing impressions with structural nucleic holes.",
