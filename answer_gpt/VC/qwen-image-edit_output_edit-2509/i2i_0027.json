      "question": "Is the dog's pose still focused on the tennis ball, with the ball near its nose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object depicted is not a real dog, but rather a toy or figurine resembling a cartoonish or chibi-style dog. The figurine is positioned such that it appears to be holding or resting its nose on a small tennis ball, suggesting focus or interaction with the ball. This is similar to Image A, where the real dog's nose is close to the tennis ball, indicating its focus on the ball. Although the representation of the 'dog' has changed from real to toy, the positioning relative to the ball is preserved.",

      "question": "Does the tennis ball retain its green color with a pink stripe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toy or figurine has a tennis ball that is green with a pink stripe, maintaining the color scheme observed in Image A, where the tennis balls are primarily green with pink accents. The consistency in color scheme suggests a deliberate choice to maintain the visual identity of the tennis ball between the two images.",

      "question": "Is the dog still depicted as observing or interacting with the tennis ball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine shows a chibi-style dog with a tennis ball near its nose, giving the impression that it is interacting with or focused on the ball. While the depiction has shifted from a real dog to a figurine, the representation of interaction is retained, similar to Image A where the dog appears to be engaged with a tennis ball. The transition from a real dog to a toy doesn't change the apparent action.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the dog's posture still reflect a prone, ball-focused position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B captures a figurine that, although not a real animal, is designed to appear as though it is engaging with a ball. However, it lacks the detailed posture nuances of a prone position since it is a static toy rather than a flexible, real dog. In Image A, the dog seems to be in a more prone, attentive position. This change indicates a shift from an animated, life-like posture to a static pose, though the general intention is similar.",

      "question": "Is the texture of the tennis ball (felt-like surface) still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis ball associated with the figurine lacks the detailed, tactile texture that would suggest a felt-like surface. The ball appears smooth, consistent with a toy representation rather than a real tennis ball, which is typically covered in a fuzzy felt material. Image A displays real tennis balls that visually suggest a typical felt texture. This difference is expected due to the nature of the materials used in creating toys versus real objects.",
