      "question": "Is the sink positioned directly below the mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe a mirror with lighting effects above a dark cabinet and sink combination. The sink appears directly beneath the mirror, aligned with the top edge of the cabinet. This positional relationship between mirror and sink is logical in bathroom design, allowing for ease of visibility while using the sink.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a mirror surrounded by a black frame.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cabinets and fixtures such as the faucet and soap dispenser are predominantly black. The sink, however, retains its white surface, which is typical for bathroom sinks due to their association with cleanliness. The contrast between the dark fixtures and bright sink is visually striking and common in modern design.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual inspection of Image B reveals that the mirror, sink, and cabinets all have distinct rectangular shapes. The mirror has a large rectangular design framed by black. The sink below has a rectangular basin, and the cabinet has a rectangular front, all aligning with each other in structure and shape.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black faucet is situated near the black soap dispenser on the sink's surface. This placement is sensible as it facilitates easy access to both water and soap while using the sink. The proximity of these elements is typical in bathroom settings to enhance functionality.",
