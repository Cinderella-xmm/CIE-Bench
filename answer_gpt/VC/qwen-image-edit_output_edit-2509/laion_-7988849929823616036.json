      "question": "Is the mustache present with its original shape, including upward curls at the ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, focusing on the bow tie and attire, we notice a pop art style with vibrant colors and patterns, suggesting a creative and whimsical edit. However, since the face region is blurred, it is impossible to discern the presence of a mustache or its specific shape, such as upward curls.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both eyes visible and positioned symmetrically with the bridge of the nose aligned centrally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurring in Image B obscures facial details, including the eyes and nose. Therefore, it is impossible to evaluate the symmetry or positioning of these features based solely on the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while vibrantly styled, the face area is blurred. Without facial detail, it remains unclear whether the hairline is visible or characterized by a receding pattern.",

    {

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From the visual cues in Image B, the bow tie is distinct and positioned centrally at the neck, depicted in a pop art fashion with symmetry beneath the collar.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any text beneath the character. The area where the text 'S. W. Kramer.' appears in Image A is left blank in Image B, focusing solely on the decorative pattern.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the facial region being blurred, it's challenging to ascertain the direction or angle of the head in Image B. Visual cues of body positioning are overshadowed by the stylistic alterations.",
