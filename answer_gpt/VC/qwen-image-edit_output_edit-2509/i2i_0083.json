      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armchairs appear to be upholstered in a material that is brown in color. The visible legs of the armchairs are light in color and appear to be made of wood.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armchairs are positioned on either side of what appears to be a display screen in the center. They have an equal distance from the screen and are aligned in a way that reflects symmetry. This arrangement is visually balanced and supports the notion of them being symmetrically placed.",

      ],

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floor in Image B appears to have a wooden texture with a reflective quality that suggests a glossy finish. The reflection of the armchairs and light on the surface indicates a polished look, characteristic of glossy wooden floors.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are subtle, diffused shadows visible on the floor beneath and around the armchairs. This indicates the presence of soft shadows, which suggests a gentle light source or ambient lighting environment creating such effects.",
