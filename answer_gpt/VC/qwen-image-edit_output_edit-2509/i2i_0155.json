      "question": "Are the plant's large, vibrant green leaves with their natural shape and arrangement retained in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves of the plant are visible as large and vibrant green, retaining their natural shape and arrangement. This conclusion is drawn from the visual appearance of the leaves in terms of color, size, and positioning, which matches a typical indoor plant thriving in sunlight.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the plant still positioned on the windowsill in the same manner as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plant remains positioned on the windowsill exactly as in Image A. The alignment, spatial orientation relative to the windowsill, and presentation of the plant in relation to the window suggests retained positioning.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the terracotta pot and saucer beneath the plant intact and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The terracotta pot and saucer in Image B are unchanged from those in Image A. This is inferred from the consistent shape, color, and position of the pot and saucer. Visual cues like the pottery's texture and design confirm no changes between the images.",

      "question": "Is the soft sunlight and its interaction with the plant and windowsill preserved as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sunlight in Image B interacts with the plant and windowsill in the same manner as in Image A. This can be determined by the retained light angle, the shadows cast by the plant on the windowsill, and the lighting on the leaves, which are consistent across both images.",
      "weight": 2,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurred greenery in Image B visible through the window remains unchanged when compared to Image A. This consistency is reflected in the background blur effect and color transition visible through the window, indicating that the view outside the window is preserved.",
