      "question": "Is the clock face present on the upper section of the left bell tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examining the left bell tower reveals no clock face on the upper section; instead, it shows an open window-like space with an arch. This can be contrasted with typical bell tower designs that may incorporate a clock, but Image B lacks such an element. Upon comparing with Image A, it is evident that Image A includes a distinctive clock face in that location, which is absent in Image B.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a singular bell visible within the arches of the right bell tower.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, the central part of the façade above the entrance showcases a circular stained-glass window with a decorative pattern, typically found in cathedral designs to provide a focal point and light filtration.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the façade with a dominant central entrance flanked by two smaller doors, forming a typical tripartite design commonly seen in grand architectural entrances. Image A similarly displays such an arrangement of doors, reinforcing the observation that the same design is consistent across both images.",
