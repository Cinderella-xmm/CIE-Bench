    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the yellow color and cubed arrangement of the mango?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image features a character resembling a mango with cubed patterns on its head. The character retains the yellow color typical of a mango's flesh, and the cubed arrangement clearly mirrors the original cubed style seen in Image A. This similarity suggests that the edited image has indeed maintained the color and arrangement associated with a mango.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the edited image retain the green color and sliced appearance of the lime?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a round, green character positioned next to the mango-like character, which seems to represent the lime. However, instead of slicing, it is a whole character with facial features, suggesting a deviation from the sliced presentation in Image A, where the lime is cut in half. Therefore, the edited image does not retain the sliced appearance of the lime.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the edited image retain the orange-red color and granular texture of the chili powder?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, next to the mango character, there is a bowl with a substance that appears orange-red, similar to powdered chili. This indicates that the color is retained. However, while the original chili powder in Image A has a visibly granular texture, the edited version does not showcase this texture as explicitly, favoring a more stylized representation. Based on the apparent loss of granular texture in the edited image, the answer is no.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the edited image retain the relative positions of the objects on the plate?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the characters (representing the mango, lime, and chili) positioned in an arrangement resembling Image A, where these items are placed next to each other. While slightly varied due to artistic depiction, their relative positioning (with the mango being the central figure) remains conceptually similar. The answer is yes because the relative positioning is broadly consistent.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the edited image retain the wooden texture of the plate?",
    "explanation": "The plate in Image A features a discernible wooden texture, contributing to an organic, natural appearance. In contrast, Image B portrays the characters on a flat surface devoid of any wooden or textured detail typically associated with a plate. Therefore, the edited image does not retain the wooden texture.",
    "answer": "No"
