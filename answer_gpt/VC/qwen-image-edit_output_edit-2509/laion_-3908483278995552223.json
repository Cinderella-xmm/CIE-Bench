      "question": "Does the edited image retain the trident with exactly three sharp, symmetrical prongs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trident held by the figure is visually analyzed. The trident has three distinct prongs, which are sharp and symmetrical, consistent with a traditional trident design known to be part of the Aquaman character's equipment.

      "question": "Are the geometric patterns (triangular and diamond-shaped plates) clearly visible and intact across the chest, arms, and legs of the armor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit of armor is visually detailed with geometric patterns. There are well-defined triangular and diamond-shaped plates visible on the chest, arms, and legs. These patterns are typical of armor design meant to offer protection and decoration, suggesting that they are meant to be part of an intricate design as seen in fantastical armor. Comparing to Image A, these patterns remain consistent, maintaining the theme and design continuity.",

      "question": "Is the hair long, wavy, and flowing over the shoulders, matching the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair of the character is observed to be long and wavy, extending over the shoulders. This type of hair is commonly associated with Aquaman's portrayal in media, where long, flowing hair symbolizes his aquatic heritage and warrior spirit. Image A also shows similar hair characteristics, ensuring a matching representation between the two images.",

      "question": "Is the full beard present and clearly visible on the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the region where a beard would be present is not visibly clear due to the blurring effect. However, based on the typical depiction of Aquaman, one can assume the presence of a beard as it's part of the standard character design in popular culture. Yet, concluding visibility is compromised due to the blurred face.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's right hand is visibly placed on the shaft of the trident. The grip seems firm, suggesting a dominant stance, which is a common depiction for a warrior holding a weapon. Observing Image A also shows the right hand firmly gripping the trident, confirming that the grip intention is consistent across both images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character stands upright, exuding a heroic stance typical of superhero poses seen in posters and promotional material, aiming to convey strength and heroism. Noticeably, the head is turned slightly to the left, consistent with heroic depictions where characters often look poised and ready for action. In Image A, a similar stance is observed, verifying the continuity of the portrayal.",
