      "question": "Are the two tall towers positioned symmetrically on either side of the central section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both towers are positioned on either side of the central section symmetrically. This is evidenced by their equal size and similar features, which are mirror images positioned equidistant from the central part of the structure. Symmetrical positioning is a common architectural feature in castle-like constructions, creating a balanced visual composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a centrally located arched doorway with a wooden door beneath a rounded arch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed an arched doorway positioned centrally in the structure. However, upon close examination, there is no visible wooden door within this arched entryway. The arch itself is prominent and rounded, but the absence of a wooden door is notable.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does a set of stone steps ascend from the water level directly to the arched entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure is clearly placed on a solid surface, likely a tabletop, with steps leading up to the central arched entrance. However, unlike in Image A where steps ascend directly from the water level, there is no body of water present in Image B. This setting indicates the absence of water-level ascent.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there multiple rectangular windows with dark frames aligned vertically on each tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each tower includes multiple rectangular windows that are arranged vertically. The frames of these windows are noticeably darker than the surrounding material of the structure, making them stand out against the lighter wood tones.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the tops of both towers feature flat surfaces with crenellated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tops of the towers are designed with flat surfaces and crenellations along the edges. This design is typical of castle-like structures, providing a historic and defensive aesthetic. The crenellations are uniform and symmetrical around the top edges of the towers.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a low stone wall extending horizontally from the right side of the castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure appears to be entirely separate from any stone wall, with no extending features on the right side. The setup is isolated and entirely made of what appears to be wooden blocks, demonstrating no continuity beyond the basic shape of the structure itself, unlike the stone extension seen in Image A.",
