    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the background composed of vertical wooden planks with patches of peeling red paint?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of vertically aligned wooden planks with noticeable red paint peeling off, revealing the wooden texture beneath. By using common world knowledge about weathered wood, the description matches a setting where wood has aged over time with peeling paint.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floorboards made of rough, aged wood with visible grain and gaps between planks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floor seems to consist of wooden planks with visible texture such as grain, and there appear to be separations suggesting individual planks. This observation aligns with the characteristics of aged or rough wood flooring based on general knowledge.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a red circular reflector attached to the rear fender near the wheel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no clear indication of a red circular reflector on the steampunk insect-related structure that replaces the traditional bicycle components. This type of detail, commonly found on standard bicycles, is not present in the design of the insect-machine hybrid.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a wire mesh basket mounted on the front handlebars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In examining Image B, the insect-like structure lacks any traditional handlebar or wire mesh basket, which are standard elements on typical bicycles. Instead, the image features mechanically complex and ornate parts fitting a steampunk theme but not resembling a traditional basket.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a metal luggage rack mounted above the rear wheel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a standard metal luggage rack as part of its complex mechanical structure resembling an insect. Such a rack, common on regular bicycles, is absent from the artistic steampunk transformation depicted.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are soft shadows cast by the bicycle onto the wall and floor, indicating directional lighting from the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the shadows of mechanical components can be observed on the floor, the source of the lighting is less explicitly represented as directional from the left. The artistic style and lighting are more stylized than realistic, making it challenging to definitively state the direction of light as common shadows would.",
