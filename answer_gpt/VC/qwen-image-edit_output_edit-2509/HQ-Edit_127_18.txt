    "Question": "Q1: Are the elephant's tusks present and curved outward in a natural arc, extending from the mouth and tapering toward the tips?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant situated inside a leather suitcase model prominently displays its tusks. These tusks curve outwards and taper towards the tips, mimicking a realistic and natural shape for elephant tusks which protrude from the mouth in an outward arc. Given the attention to detail in this model exhibit, we can conclude that the tusks are correctly represented.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the elephant's skin display deep, wrinkled folds across the forehead, neck, and body, consistent with natural elephant dermatology?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the model elephant's skin shows a texture with pronounced wrinkles and folds across the forehead, neck, and body. These details add a sense of realism to the model, imitating the common dermatological features of actual elephants. Such precision in skin details is consonant with natural elephant skin characteristics, which light grey, thick and wrinkled as a method of temperature regulation and protection.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the acacia tree present with a broad, flat canopy and extended horizontal branches above the elephant?",
    "explanation": "Image B contains a miniature acacia tree situated to the left of the elephant. This tree visibly displays a broad, flat canopy with horizontal branches, akin to the natural form of an acacia tree typical of African savanna landscapes that provide shade and shelter.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the foreground covered in tall, golden-yellow grass blades that extend upward and show subtle motion from wind?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground inside the suitcase features sparse, short tufts of golden-yellow grass. Unlike a savanna with tall, expansive grass, these grass elements are shorter and part of the staged diorama, lacking the impression of wind-induced motion. The layout is more static, designed to fit within the confines of the suitcase without any visible motion.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are snow-capped mountains visible in the background, forming a distant ridge line behind the elephant?",
    "explanation": "The backdrop in Image B within the suitcase displays a painted scenery that includes small mountainous shapes. These shapes suggest elevated terrain and appear as snow-capped due to a lighter coloration at their peaks. Thus, the backdrop does replicate the look of distant snow-capped mountains behind the model elephant.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the elephant's trunk curled at the tip and showing segmented ridges along its length?",
    "explanation": "Examining Image B, the elephant's trunk is shown extending downward without a curled tip. However, it does display the typical segmented ridges along its length, suggestive of the natural flexibility and anatomical segmentation seen in real elephant trunks.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do the elephant's ears have a large, broad, fan-shaped outline with visible internal folds and a downward flare?",
    "explanation": "The model elephant in Image B is depicted with large, broad ears resembling the fan-like structure typical of African elephants. These ears have visible internal creases and a slight downward flare, which aids in cooling and radiating excess body heat, aligning with natural elephant ear characteristics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Is the lighting consistent with a source from the upper left, casting shadows on the right side of the elephant and grass?",
    "explanation": "In the Image B diorama, the lighting illustrated in the scene appears to descend from an upper left direction, with observable shading on the right sides of the model elements, including the elephant and tufts of grass. This artistry creates a realistic light and shadow interplay, enhancing the three-dimensional appearance of the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
