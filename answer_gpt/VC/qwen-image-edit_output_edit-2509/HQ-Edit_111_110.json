        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the books on the bottom shelf do not have any visible carved symbol like a key with swirling arms and central knob, especially on the leftmost book. Image B features a structure where smaller books are placed, and no such detailed carving is visible as described. Thus, this specific motif is not present.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examining the central book on the bottom shelf, there are no distinct spiral motifs visible on the surface of a book's spine. The books appear smaller and lack intricate detail that would characterize such a motif. Therefore, this design feature described is not present.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookshelf appears to be constructed using Lego-like blocks without any intricate Celtic knotwork patterns on the top panel or side frames. There are books placed in a structured, tower-like arrangement but without decorative elements such as knotwork on the supporting structures.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, none of the books show any visible carved spines as the books appear standard and lack carvings that would typically stand out as detailed spine work. The image does not display any evident carving distribution across the shelves in this manner.",
