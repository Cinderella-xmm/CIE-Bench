    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the woman’s silver hair clearly visible and styled in a short, neat manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outline of the woman’s head is entirely filled in as part of the illustration's silhouetted design. Therefore, it is not possible to ascertain the visibility or style of her hair.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both hands visibly holding the open book, with fingers wrapped around the edges of the pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a stylized silhouette rendering, which means specific details like hands and fingers are represented in solid black without distinct outlines or finger visibility. Thus, it is not possible to see the fingers or how they are positioned relative to the book.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a tabby cat sitting on the red rug in the lower-right corner, facing upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire cat is not visible as it is not included in the silhouette design of the illustration. The simplification of the image into artistic lines and shapes does not capture the cat’s presence.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the armchair have a high backrest, padded arms, and visible wooden legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chair is depicted in a silhouette style. The high backrest and padded arms are visible due to the distinctive lines and shapes. However, detailed features like wooden legs are not distinctly visible in the silhouette.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a stack of five books on the floor to the left of the chair, with a white mug resting on top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire left side of the chair is rendered in a simplified style where specific objects, like a stack of books and a mug, are not represented. The design uses outlines to suggest furniture but does not detail individual objects such as books or mugs clearly.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a white mug on the small wooden side table to the right of the woman?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower section to the right of the woman includes fewer details, and the simple silhouette styling does not display a side table or mug.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a beige knitted blanket with lace-like patterns draped over the woman’s lap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the use of intricate, patterned designs in the silhouette suggests the presence of fabric with ornate patterns, consistent with a lace-like effect. This artistic design represents the blanket in an abstract way.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the woman seated upright with a slight forward lean, facing the viewer while reading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, with its silhouette format, positions the woman upright in the chair, but the artistic design does not provide enough details to assess her precise lean or direction of gaze accurately.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    }
