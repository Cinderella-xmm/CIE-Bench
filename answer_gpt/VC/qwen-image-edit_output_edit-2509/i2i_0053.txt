    "Question": "Q2: Is the banana holder depicted with a curved metal arm supported by a wooden base?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the banana holder is illustrated as having a curved metal arm that is attached to what appears to be a wooden base. This follows an exaggerated and stylized cartoon form, but it maintains the core features of a curved metal arm and a base that simulates a wood finish. It is in line with what a banana holder typically looks like in reality.",

    "Question": "Q3: Do the bananas still rest naturally on the curved metal arm?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, although the depiction is cartoon-like, the bananas are shown hanging from the curved metal arm of the holder. This position mimics the natural way bananas rest when they are hung on a banana stand. Despite the whimsical nature of the drawing, the bananas' placement is consistent with how gravity affects them when hung.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the bananas shown in a bunch, connected at the top?",
    "explanation": "The image displays the bananas as a pair clearly connected at the top, which is a common feature of how bananas grow in bunches. This characteristic is preserved in the cartoon style of Image B, maintaining the traditional presentation of bananas as seen in reality.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the wooden base of the banana holder retain its wood-like texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the banana holder is drawn in a simple cartoon style, and it does not exhibit an actual wood-like texture. Instead, it is simply outlined and colored to suggest a base but lacks any detailed texture to indicate wood grain, which is commonly associated with real wood surfaces. Thus, the image does not retain the wood-like texture.",
    "answer": "No"
