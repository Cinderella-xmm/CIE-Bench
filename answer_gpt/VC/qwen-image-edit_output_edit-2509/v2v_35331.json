      "question": "Is the background composed of green grass with visible blades and natural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of green grass that shows visible blades, which appear natural and textured. The grass displays a realistic appearance characteristic of outdoor environments, where blades are distinguishable and varied. This suggests a natural setting.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there soft shadows cast by the subject(s) onto the grass, consistent with natural outdoor lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears diffuse and even, but there are slight variations in tone on the grass around the chihuahua and banana, which could be interpreted as soft shadows, consistent with natural outdoor lighting. This suggests the presence of shadows even if they are subtle and unobtrusive.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the fused form positioned directly on the grass surface, with contact points visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chihuahua and banana are resting on what appears to be the grass surface. The parts of the objects at the bottom contact the grass directly, and the image composition suggests they are placed on the ground, with their shadows aligning with the rest of the scene.",

      "is_correct": true
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grass in Image B is primarily green, with slight variations in shading and tone throughout the scene. These variations create a realistic appearance typical of natural grass, indicating different depths and lighting conditions often found outdoors.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chihuahua is tan-colored, and the banana is yellow, maintaining their distinct natural colors as seen in the real world: a tan coat for the chihuahua and the typical yellow of a banana. Both hues are clearly present, preserving the colors of the original forms.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
