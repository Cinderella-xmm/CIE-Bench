      "question": "Does the lion’s silhouette retain the distinct, wide, rounded mane shape around its head and neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette of the lion is presented as a solid black shape against a vibrant sunset background, emphasizing the outline against the light. The mane is visible as a wide and rounded shape, characteristic of a lion's mane, surrounding its head and neck. Commonly, a male lion's mane is distinctively large and forms a conspicuous frame around the head. This silhouette retains that iconic mane shape, ensuring it is recognizable even in silhouette form.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the lion depicted with its front legs forward and rear legs bent, maintaining a poised, dominant stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette of the lion shows the front legs extended forward, with one leg in particular moving ahead, indicative of a stride or command posture. The rear legs appear bent, which is typical of a lion in a ready or walking pose. This posture conveys a sense of movement or poised dominance, which is associated with powerful, confident wildlife images.",

      "question": "Is the lion’s head turned slightly toward the viewer, rather than fully in profile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silhouette in Image B presents the lion's head in a classic profile pose. The entire body, including the head, is oriented to the side, suggesting full profile instead of a head turned towards the viewer. This is a common pose to highlight the majestic profile of the lion.",

      "question": "Is there grass present in the foreground beneath the lion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a silhouette of the savanna, which includes the lion and the foreground elements such as grass. The presence of grass is suggested by the dark, silhouetted area beneath and around the lion. This use of silhouette imagery reinforces the sense of being in a grassland environment, typical of the lion's natural habitat.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, stylized silhouettes of acacia trees are visible in the background. These trees are known for their flat-topped canopies and are commonly depicted in African savanna scenes. The silhouette style in Image B emphasizes these iconic shapes against the sunset, making them recognizable as acacia trees.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lion is centrally placed and significantly larger in scale compared to the elements in the background. This central and dominant positioning of the lion make it the focal point of the image, emphasizing its importance and the 'King of the Wild' theme. The size and placement enhance the dramatic effect of the scene, a common technique in wildlife imagery to showcase the lion's majesty.",
