    "Question": "Q1: Is the 'DATSUN' text visibly present and centered on the front of the decanter?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, we observe the front of a decanter designed to resemble a car. The focus should be on any text or emblem that might be present on the front. Analyzing the visual cues in Image B, no text or emblem resembling 'DATSUN' is visibly centered on the front of the decanter. Instead, there's a decorative seal with text that doesn’t resemble a lettering that would be associated with car branding. Thus, based on visual analysis, the 'DATSUN' text is not visibly present on the decanter.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the '240Z' script visible on the side of the decanter near the front wheel well?",
    "explanation": "The decanter in Image B features a significant central label that is the focus of the design. It does not mimic the detailed characteristics of a car, such as the '240Z' script which would likely be on the body near a wheel well of a car. The absence of car-specific scripts, focusing instead on a stylized design relevant to decanters rather than cars, indicates that no '240Z' script is visible on the side of the decanter.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the decanter maintain the long hood and short rear deck proportions of the original car?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing the decanter in Image B, it is shaped characteristically for holding liquid with design aesthetics typical of high-end decanters, which are generally rectangular and symmetrical. These are different from the structural proportions of a car, which would include a long hood and a short rear deck, typically found in a sports car design like a Datsun. The decanter does not mimic these car-specific proportions.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are vertical slats visible on the front of the decanter, mimicking the original grille pattern?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the decanter is dominated by a label design, and there is no presence of vertical slats that would resemble a car’s grille pattern. This is expected as the design of a decanter focuses on aesthetics suitable for its function rather than mimicking specific automotive features like grilles.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the 'DATSUN' emblem positioned centrally on the front face of the decanter?",
    "explanation": "While examining Image B, there is no emblem resembling the 'DATSUN' brand centrally positioned on the front face. The design instead features a decorative emblem or motif that looks more like a seal or a logo for the decanter. Therefore, the absence of a 'DATSUN' emblem is noticeable.",
    "answer": "No"
