      "question": "Is the train represented in a red-and-gray color block scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train is depicted using large, clear blocks of colors, specifically red and gray. This minimalist style uses solid colors without detailed textures, effectively creating a color block scheme. The red stripe runs horizontally along the train while gray is used for both the background and the rest of the train body, indicating a streamlined design common in modern artistic interpretations.",

      "question": "Is the sign circular with the text \"STOP\" clearly displayed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a sign that is prominently rectangular with a red, octagonal stop sign placed within it. This fits the standard design of 'STOP' signs, where the octagonal shape is internationally recognized for stop signs. The text 'STOP' is clearly displayed in the center of this octagon, contrary to the option of a circular shape.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the train positioned parallel to the tracks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train runs alongside the tracks in a manner that is visually aligned with them, indicating a parallel position. This is consistent with common train placement along railway tracks for a realistic train station representation, emphasizing proper alignment and direction.",

      "question": "Are there green mountain outlines in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes the outlines of mountains in the background, depicted in a monochrome greenish-blue geometric style. Such representation conveys the presence of mountains without a detailed color scheme, using just the silhouette outlines, aligning with minimalist design conventions of simplified landscape features.",

      "question": "Are simplified track lines present beneath the train?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train is shown running above clear and simplified track lines, depicted using geometric representations of rails. The lines beneath reflect a streamlined, abstract representation without intricate detailing, typical of illustrative simplifications in art or design.",
