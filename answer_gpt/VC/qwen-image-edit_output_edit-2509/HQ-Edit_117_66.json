    {

      "question": "Are there exactly four dragons, one in each quadrant of the cover?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cover features a puzzle design with a central circular motif that resembles a compass, surrounded by dragon images. The puzzle is composed of pieces, and although dragon silhouettes are visible, the puzzle format makes it challenging to clearly distinguish four separate dragons or assign each to a specific quadrant. However, the arrangement of the dragons' parts seems approximately separated by quadrants. Thus, it's reasonable to infer four dragons based on traditional quadrant imagery and the arrangement seen.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a central circular compass composed of concentric rings with inscribed characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a central design that strongly resembles a compass. It contains several concentric circles with markings that could be interpreted as inscribed characters. The presence of these rings and markings implies that this is indeed a compass-like structure.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a star-shaped pointer located at the center of the compass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the center of the compass has a visible design element that is consistent with a star-shaped pointer, a common feature in compass designs to indicate direction. This is evident from the constituent lines and shapes radiating from the central point.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the dragons arranged symmetrically around the central compass, with each facing toward the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The puzzle design of Image B suggests that dragons' bodies run along the edges of the board but due to the jigsaw format, their exact posture isn't entirely discernible. However, based on the space around the central compass and traditional designs, it's reasonable to assume they are oriented toward the center for a balanced visual appearance.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the dragons separated by cross-shaped lines dividing the cover into four equal quadrants?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature explicit cross-shaped lines; instead, the division is implied by the arrangement of puzzle pieces and the central compass design. Therefore, while there is an inferred division in how the elements are placed, this does not manifest explicitly as cross-shaped lines.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there Chinese characters inscribed within the concentric rings of the central compass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the concentric rings of the central design include markings that appear to be symbolic or textual, they do not clearly resemble recognizable Chinese characters. Instead, the design gives the impression of ornate symbols or patterns often used in decorative compasses.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the dragons have coiled bodies with raised heads and extended claws, consistent with traditional Chinese dragon depictions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragons' bodies are intertwined and appear coiled, consistent with some traditional depictions. However, specifics about raised heads and extended claws are obscured due to the jigsaw design and reliance on silhouette and shading rather than detailed dragon anatomy.",
