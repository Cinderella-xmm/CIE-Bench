    "Question": "Q1: Is the central floral medallion located on the front center of the body, surrounded by symmetrical scrollwork?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no clear indication of a teapot with a floral medallion and symmetrical scrollwork since the visible object is a candle with an intricate lid design.

From common knowledge, a central floral medallion surrounded by symmetrical scrollwork suggests a decorative design found typically on ornate items like teapots. Since the candle doesnâ€™t exhibit such a feature, the answer is No.",
