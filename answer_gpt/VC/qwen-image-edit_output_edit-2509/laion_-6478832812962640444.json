      "question": "Is the toe box of the boot rounded?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toe box of the boot is observed to be squared off rather than rounded. Typically, a rounded toe box will have a circular or softer rounded edge, but the boot in Image B has a straight, angular front at the toe box, indicating a squared design.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boot in Image B displays a shaft opening that is indeed V-shaped. This can be identified by the characteristic angular indentation at the top of the shaft, which forms the letter 'V'.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible continuous white piping running vertically along the outer side of the shaft. The boot is decorated with intricate golden geometric patterns, but these do not mimic the appearance of a continuous piping.",
