      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quilt is visually composed of large, colorful blocks resembling toy building bricks, primarily in red, yellow, blue, green, and other bright colors. There is no presence of detailed designs or motifs that resemble a red football with white laces. This indicates the lack of any specific sports motifs or designs resembling a football.",

      "question": "Is the black-and-white soccer ball with hexagonal pattern present in the quilt’s design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's quilt design does not include any detailed images or motifs, such as a black-and-white soccer ball with a hexagonal pattern. Instead, the image integrates a uniform pattern of large, brightly colored bricks without any sports-related patterns. This suggests the absence of specific sports motif detailing like a soccer ball.",

      "question": "Is the orange basketball with black lines present in the quilt’s design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quilt is constructed of larger, simple color blocks styled to mimic interlocking building blocks without intricate patterns like an orange basketball with black lines. The lack of sports-related detailing signifies that there is no presence of a basketball motif.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the white baseball with red stitching present in the quilt’s design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the quilt lacks detailed designs or motifs, focusing on a larger and broader interlocking pattern of solid colors. This simple block style does not accommodate intricate sport motifs such as a white baseball with red stitching; therefore, this design element does not appear.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the quilt composed of a grid of colored squares arranged in a patchwork pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The quilt in Image B consists of large, distinct blocks resembling massive versions of building toy bricks, arranged in a repetitive, homogeneous pattern. While the design is orderly, it lacks the finer, smaller-scale segmentation typically seen in a traditional patchwork quilt. Therefore, it doesn't fit the classic description of a patchwork quilt.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are blue and white stars present between the sports ball motifs in the quilt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals a design based on large, uniformly colored brick-like structures. There are no signs of stars or other minor decorative details like those seen commonly with sports ball themes, meaning such intricate embellishments are absent.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the sports balls positioned in the same relative locations within the patchwork grid as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, various sports balls are integrated within a patchwork design featuring blue stars. Image B departs from this intricate layout, featuring instead large, solid color block patterns. Since there are neither sports ball designs nor a similar patchwork layout present in Image B, no comparison of relative positioning can be made.",
