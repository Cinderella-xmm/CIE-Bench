    "Question": "Q1: Is the distinctive golden lattice framework of the Address Downtown tower visible and structurally intact?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the tower's design is no longer the focus due to the presence of a large futuristic robot, which obscures the view of the buildings. However, the framing and style of elements such as lighting effects that resemble the golden lattice framework could still be recognized in the surroundings, but the structure isn't visible as before. Given that, compared to the original Image A, the focus has shifted significantly.",
