    "Question": "Q1: Is the circular logo featuring a navy blue 'C' shape with a red semicircle at the top present on the front of the energy drink can?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the logo on the shoe features a navy blue 'C' shape as part of the Champion brand logo, located prominently on the shoe's side. By visualizing an energy drink can, the expectation would be that the logo is present similarly prominently if translated to the can surface. As the question refers to the 'front of the can,' and the logo is on the side in the shoe context, the literal comparison suggests it may not be as imagined on the front of the can.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the energy drink can feature the navy blue mesh texture across its main body surface?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a shoe with a navy blue mesh texture over its mid and upper sections. If translated to an energy drink can, similar texture might be expected around its main surface. However, considering typical can designs, such mesh texturing might not conform to practical manufacturing, though simulating a design, it could be envisioned.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the navy blue laces depicted as raised embossed ridges wrapping around the middle section of the can in their original crisscross pattern?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the navy blue laces in a crisscross pattern are visually prominent on the shoe's exterior. If visualizing these on an energy drink can, such distinctive pattern could translate as purely decorative embossing covering the central portion of the can. While original functionality isn't replicated, visual identity might be transferred.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are three navy blue stripes arranged horizontally across the lower portion of the can, matching the original shoe's stripe layout?",
    "explanation": "Image B has three navy blue stripes arranged on the shoe sole, visually indicating a branding design. Transferred to an energy drink can, one would expect these stripes to be similarly aligned horizontally across the lower portion as identity markers derived from the shoe.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the word 'Kickstart' displayed in red lettering on the upper portion of the can?",
    "explanation": "Image B prominently features the word 'Kickstart' in red lettering across the side of the shoe, situated below the laces section. This positioning informs similar placement onto an imagined energy drink can where prominent branding text likely is displayed for consumer visibility.",
    "answer": "Yes"
