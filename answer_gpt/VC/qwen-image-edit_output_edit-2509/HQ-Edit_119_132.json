        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a plush toy that resembles a husky dog.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes of the plush toy in Image B are designed with a vivid blue color, which is a characteristic feature often found in Siberian Huskies and is commonly replicated in husky-themed plush toys. The bright blue gives the eyes a life-like and attractive quality.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plush toy in Image B features ears that are upright and pointed, although they maintain the softness typical of a stuffed object. This design mimics real husky ears, which are known for their erect and pointed shape, enhancing the toy's resemblance to an actual husky.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush husky does not have tan and cream fur with dark brown markings. Instead, it features a more simplified and stylized color scheme, primarily in shades of gray with white patches typical of husky plush toys, rather than the naturalistic tan and cream coloring.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plush toy in Image B is depicted sitting upright, with its front paws positioned forward in a seated pose. This pose is typical of how plush toy animals are often designed to sit, as it allows the toy to remain stable when displayed.",

      ],

      "explanation": "The plush toy in Image B has a simplified and stylized form compared to a real dog, but its design does suggest a broad chest and wedge-shaped head, common in husky breeds. Plush toys often exaggerate these features to create a recognizably distinct and cute character.",
