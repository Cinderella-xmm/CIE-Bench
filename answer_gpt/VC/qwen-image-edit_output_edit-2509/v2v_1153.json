      "question": "Are the cherry blossom trees with pink blossoms still present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, cherry blossom trees with pink blossoms are visible on the left and right sides of the scene, indicating that these elements have been preserved from Image A. They are depicted with clusters of pink flowers against the blue sky, which aligns with the common appearance of cherry blossoms and suggests a continuity from the original image.",

      "question": "Do the buildings retain their traditional Japanese architectural outlines despite the material change?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows buildings with futuristic materials, such as blue-glowing panels and sleek surfaces. Despite the material update, the buildings maintain their traditional Japanese architectural outlines, such as tiered roofs and pagoda-style shapes. This indicates a combination of modern materials while keeping traditional design, which reflects the retention of architectural outlines.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the straw hat with a red band still placed on the stone pedestal in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a straw hat with a red band prominently placed in the foreground, consistent with the placement seen in Image A. The pedestal beneath the hat in Image B has a metallic material instead of stone but maintains the same shape and position relative to the hat. Thus, the straw hat exists as before, albeit with the base material changed.",

      "question": "Does the image still feature a blue sky with scattered cherry blossom petals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a blue sky is depicted, mimicking the original image. Cherry blossom petals are shown scattered in the sky, similar to the ones present in Image A, indicating that this aspect has remained unchanged.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the straw hat positioned on the stone pedestal in the same location relative to the buildings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing both images, the straw hat in Image B is in the same relative position to the surrounding buildings as in Image A. The hat occupies the foreground centered on the pathway leading into the architectural scene, demonstrating unchanged spatial relation despite the transformation of the pedestal materials.",
