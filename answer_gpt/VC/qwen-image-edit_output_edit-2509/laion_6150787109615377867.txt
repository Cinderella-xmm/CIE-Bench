    "Question": "Q1: Is the tabletop still circular in shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tabletop has a circular shape as indicated by the round, gear-like design at the top. The presence of round designs and symmetrical edges contribute to identifying the shape as circular, similar to the traditional tabletops that are commonly round.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does a single vertical column extend from the center of the tabletop to the base?",
    "explanation": "Image B features multiple components connecting the tabletop to the base, including intricately designed tubes and pipes, not a single vertical column. Typically, a single vertical column is a straightforward feature, whereas this design is complex and involves multiple structures.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the base consist of five symmetrically arranged legs forming a star shape?",
    "explanation": "The base in Image B does not include a star-shaped design formed by five legs. Instead, it features mechanical structures with complex, jointed designs resembling steampunk aesthetics, which differ from the straightforward star-shaped base in traditional designs.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there small black rubber feet at the tip of each leg?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the legs do not have small black rubber feet at their tips. Instead, the legs or supports end with mechanical elements typical of steampunk designs, showcasing gears and dials rather than simple rubber feet.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the height of the central column approximately equal to the diameter of the tabletop?",
    "explanation": "Since Image B does not have a distinct central column like in traditional table designs, but rather complex mechanical components connecting the tabletop to the base, the comparison to diameter is not applicable in the conventional sense. Thus, no singular column height can be assessed to be equal to the tabletop's diameter.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the main body of the table still made of a shiny, silver-colored metal?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a design inspired by steampunk aesthetics with bronze and copper tones, adorned with gears and pipes. Unlike the original which is silver-toned, this table represents brass or bronze with intricate detailing, indicating a departure from the shiny silver metal appearance.",
    "answer": "No"
