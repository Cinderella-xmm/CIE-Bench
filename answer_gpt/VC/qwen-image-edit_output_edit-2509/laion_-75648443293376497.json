    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the roll-top closure secured by two vertical brown leather straps positioned symmetrically on the front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roll-top closure is secured by two vertical straps, which appear gold in color rather than brown leather. The straps are symmetrically positioned on the front of the backpack, visually similar in function to leather straps but differing in color and possibly material. Given the description, although the positioning is symmetrical, the distinction lies in the material observed in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a central snap button closure on the front flap of the backpack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a central snap button closure on the front flap of the backpack, clearly visible and consistent with typical backpack design. The button is placed centrally, serving as an additional securing mechanism besides the top flap closure.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there two side pockets, each trimmed with brown leather, located on the left and right sides of the backpack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two side pockets are visible, but they are not trimmed with brown leather. The pockets have patches on them and appear part of the same leather-like material used for the backpack. This variation indicates a design change compared to typical leather trimming.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a small rectangular leather brand patch located on the lower right front panel of the backpack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not have a small rectangular leather brand patch on the lower right front panel. Instead, it features graphic prints and decorations across the backpack's surface, consistent with its vintage explorative theme.",

      "question": "Are there two metal D-rings attached to the bottom corners of the backpack via brown leather loops?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom corners of the backpack do feature metal D-rings, but they are attached using the same material as the backpack. The description of brown leather loops does not fit the design presented in Image B, highlighting a difference in attachment material.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays shoulder straps that are symmetrically aligned and centered relative to the backpack's body. This alignment is crucial in ensuring comfort and balance when carrying the backpack, consistent with ergonomic design.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show visible stitching lines defining compartments or edges. The design is smooth and integrated with graphic elements, emphasizing aesthetic appeal rather than structural stitching visibility.",
