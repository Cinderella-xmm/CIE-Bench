      "question": "Is the man’s white beard and mustache clearly present and retaining their original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The man's beard and mustache are components of his facial profile. In Image B, these features should be assessed based on their visibility and original shape. Although the face is blurred, the area below the blur shows indistinct details suggesting that the beard and mustache are not clearly present. Image A also seems blurry but retains shape recognition. Therefore, for Image B, considering the blur, these features are not clearly visible.",
