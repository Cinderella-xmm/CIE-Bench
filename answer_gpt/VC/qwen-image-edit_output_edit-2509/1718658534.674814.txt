    "Question": "Q1: Is the dorsal ridge composed of a series of raised, looped structures running along the back of the pig?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a pig-shaped object with a dorsal ridge featuring sharp vertical structures, resembling scales or leaves commonly seen in designs, especially in decorative art.
