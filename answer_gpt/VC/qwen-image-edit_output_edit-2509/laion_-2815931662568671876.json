      "question": "Is the coarse, slightly cracked texture of the largest tortilla chip retained, including visible salt crystals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When analyzing Image B, observe the depiction of tortilla chips, which are animated cartoon characters. The surface texture does not depict realistic food qualities such as coarseness, cracks, or salt crystals; instead, it features a simplified design with smooth surfaces typical in animation. In contrast, Image A displays a realistic texture with visible cracks and salt crystals indicative of baked tortilla chips.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays tortilla chips as cartoon characters with a slightly yellowish-brown color, typical in animation but lacking the depth and tonal variation expected in real food representation.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guacamole is depicted as a part of a cartoon setting, showing little detail in texture or individual avocado pieces. Image A displays the guacamole mound with evident chunks and a rugged texture typical of mashed avocado, emphasizing a realistic presentation.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates guacamole in a simplified cartoon form, using a uniform green hue without the intricate color gradient seen in real avocados. Image A showcases guacamole with a natural green-yellow gradient, reflecting the typical appearance of mashed avocado.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
