      "question": "Are there exactly four wooden trays arranged in a 2x2 grid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trays appear to be illustrated with colorful geometric patterns, but they are no longer wooden. There are four trays arranged in a 2x2 grid, matching the arrangement in Image A. Thus, even though their appearance has been altered, the count and arrangement remain the same.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects in the tray labeled as 'Madeleine' do not have a shell-shaped form. Instead, the pastries are illustrated as round muffins, lacking the typical scalloped edges of traditional madeleines.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the label reading 'Madeleine' is positioned near muffins, which do not have a shell shape. The pastries in the tray with this label are not shell-shaped, indicating that the label is not by shell-shaped pastries.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trays are illustrated with a colorful, comic-style aesthetic. These trays do not feature any engraving of the word 'craster', unlike the wooden trays with the visible 'craster' engraving in Image A.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of parchment paper, the trays are lined with vibrant, patterned paper as part of the stylized illustration. This contrasts with Image A, where each tray contains parchment paper.",
