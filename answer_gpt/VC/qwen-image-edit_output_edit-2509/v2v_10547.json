        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a swirling vortex texture in the sky, characterized by circular and curvilinear brushstrokes typical of Vincent van Gogh's 'Starry Night,' a hallmark of the Post-Impressionist style. This distinct pattern suggests dynamic movement and is a signature element of this artwork. By observing these patterns in the sky of Image B, we can conclude that the swirling vortex texture is indeed retained.",

      "question": "Is the prominent cypress tree on the left side of the image still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a large, dark cypress tree is visible on the left side of the image. This tree is a significant feature in the 'Starry Night' painting by van Gogh, commonly known for its towering, flame-like appearance that reaches upwards into the sky. Its presence in Image B confirms that this element is retained. Observing the same region in Image A also shows this tree, thus confirming its continuity in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a depiction of a village with a central church steeple, a recognizable component of van Gogh's 'Starry Night.' This element adds depth and context to the landscape portrayed. By reviewing the center of Image B and comparing it with Image A, it's evident that the village and the steeple are present in both images, indicating that this feature has been retained in the edited image.",

      "question": "Are the rolling hills visible in the background of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horizon features rolling hills, providing a sense of depth and contributing to the overall complexity of the landscape. These hills, characteristic in van Gogh's original composition, are depicted in subdued colors, blending with the sky and other elements. Observing Image B confirms the presence of these hills, and comparison with Image A further validates their continuity in the edited image.",

      "question": "Does the image retain the original blue and yellow color palette and thick brushstroke texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the hallmark blue and yellow hues and the thick, expressive brushstrokes associated with 'Starry Night.' The vibrant blues of the sky and the swirling light of stars and the moon are rendered using broad, textural strokes, a defining feature of van Gogh's style. This texture and palette are crucial to the piece's aesthetic and are preserved in Image B, matching what is seen in Image A, thus affirming its retention in the edited image.",
