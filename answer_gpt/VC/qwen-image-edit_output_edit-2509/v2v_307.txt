    "Question": "Q1: Does the bandage retain its rounded rectangular shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shape of the bandage remains a rounded rectangle. This is evident from the consistent curvature and overall outline, commonly associated with standard bandage shapes. It matches general design principles of bandages, which often feature rounded edges to avoid sharp corners that might snag on clothing or skin.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the central adhesive strip still present in the same relative position and size?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central adhesive strip is visible on the bandage and maintains a similar relative position and size as expected in typical bandage designs. This strip is consistently located in the center, which is characteristic of adhesive bandages, offering support and padding over the wound area.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the bandage retain its visible fabric texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bandage displays a fabric-like texture, easily recognizable by its surface-like appearance. The details that suggest fabric include the grainy, woven pattern, which is indicative of the cloth used in many bandages for flexibility and absorbency.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the bandage's overall proportions consistent with the original image?",
    "explanation": "The proportions of the bandage in Image B seem consistent with what would be expected from a typical bandage presented in Image A. The length-to-width ratio along with the relative size of the adhesive strip suggests no significant alteration in its proportions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a shadow cast by the bandage, contributing to its three-dimensional appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bandage is displayed as part of a box, shown in a cartoon packaging style, indicating this is not a physical bandage image anymore. The side of the box that would have a shadow on the surface is not visible, unlike a real bandage, which would cast a shadow due to natural light, therefore not contributing to a three-dimensional appearance.",
    "answer": "No"
