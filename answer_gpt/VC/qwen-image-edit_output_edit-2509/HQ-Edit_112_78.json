      "question": "Is the central floral medallion located on the front center of the body, surrounded by symmetrical scrollwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no clear indication of a teapot with a floral medallion and symmetrical scrollwork since the visible object is a candle with an intricate lid design. The candle features a pattern on the lid but does not resemble the described teapot. From common knowledge, a central floral medallion surrounded by symmetrical scrollwork suggests a decorative design found typically on ornate items like teapots. Since the candle doesnâ€™t exhibit such a feature, the answer is No.",

      "question": "Does the spout extend from the left side of the body with a curled, scroll-like tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object depicted is a candle with no spout visible, as it does not match the description of a teapot or an object with a spout, unlike a teapot where you might expect such features. Thus, based on the content in Image B, the spout feature is not present at all, leading to the answer No.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a lidded candle on a marble stand, with no visible handle resembling a C shape with ornate ends. The description typically applies to an ornate teapot, not present in the image of the candle. The absence of such a handle on the object leads to the answer No.",

      "question": "Is there a small decorative finial atop the lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the candle has a lid with a small decorative finial that is clearly visible. This matches the description of an ornate finial, which is a common decorative element on the tops of lids or covers in elegant designs. Therefore, the presence of this feature in the image results in the answer Yes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B, which is a candle on a marble column, does not have any visible ornate feet. Typically, the ornate feet would be found on antique teapots or similar items, not on modern candles as depicted. Hence, the absence of such a feature on the base of the candle leads to the answer No.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the candle features a swirling decorative pattern, particularly on the lid and the body of the candle holder, indicating some level of symmetry. While not floral or foliate in a traditional sense, the symmetry in design can mirror that of ornamental objects. Therefore, while not strictly floral or foliate, there is symmetric decorative work around the object, which could lead to an answer of Yes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B has a rounded silhouette and a domed lid, but it does not feature a spout or handle as would be expected in a teapot. The candle with its lid resembles the domed aspect, but essential features like a spout and handle are lacking, leading to the conclusion of No.",
