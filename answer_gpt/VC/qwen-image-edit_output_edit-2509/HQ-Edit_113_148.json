      "question": "Does the transformed sculpture retain a central tall spire flanked by multiple smaller turrets arranged symmetrically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal sculpture does retain a central tall spire, with several smaller turrets symmetrically arranged around it. This arrangement mimics a typical castle design, where a central structure is surrounded by smaller ones to create a balanced and cohesive look. This symmetry is a common architectural feature for both sandcastles and imaginative buildings meant to represent castles.",

      "question": "Are there small red flags positioned at the tip of each turret of the crystal sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, small red flags are noticeable at the tips of several turrets in the crystal sculpture. These flags are visually distinct with their red color contrasting against the clear blue hue of the crystal structure. This design detail is a common decorative element in castle imagery to add a sense of realism and embellishment.",

      "question": "Is the shovel located in the foreground, angled toward the base of the castle, and partially submerged in reflective water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shovel is not present at all. The focus is on the crystal sculpture and the gemstones placed in front of it. The image lacks the presence of a shovel, whether in its original form or transformed into another material. Therefore, none of these specific details about the shovel's position and surroundings apply to Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the gemstones (replacing seashells) grouped in a cluster at the foot of the crystal castle, similar to the original shell arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, gemstones are concentrated near the base of the crystal castle, similarly to how seashells are arranged in Image A. This deliberate placement of gemstones creates a visual effect reminiscent of the shell grouping, using similar compositional techniques to ensure balance and cohesiveness within the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the frosted glass slab feature a continuous horizontal wave pattern that mimics the original oceanâ€™s rolling motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The frosted glass slab in Image B shows a wave-like pattern in the background, echoing the continuous and rolling waves from the ocean in Image A. The artistic representation in Image B gives the impression of movement and fluidity similar to the original ocean depiction, though simplified by the medium.",

      "question": "Is the tallest tower located centrally within the crystal sculpture, rising above all other structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tallest tower in Image B is positioned centrally in the crystal sculpture, evident from its prominence and the arrangement of smaller turrets surrounding it. This central placement is consistent with traditional castle designs where the most prominent structure is often central, symbolizing importance and hierarchy.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the shovel retain a red blade and yellow handle, even if rendered in crystal or another material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no shovel visible in Image B. The focus of the image is on the crystal sculpture and the gemstones, without any depiction of a shovel in either its original or transformed state. Therefore, the question of color retention for the shovel does not apply.",
