      "question": "Are the two garage doors positioned side by side on the lower front portion of the cabin, directly beneath the large upper window section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the region corresponding to where garage doors would typically be located on a cabin has been transformed into circular, glowing green portals with mystical engravings and is not a traditional structure with visible garage doors. Therefore, the two garage doors positioned side by side as in a traditional cabin structure, as they are in Image A, are not depicted in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a large, multi-pane window section with exposed wooden beams located directly above the two garage doors, spanning most of the front width of the cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the traditional window section seen in a standard cabin is replaced with mystical elements, such as glowing eyes and green light effects. There are no traditional windows with wooden beams as observed in standard constructions like in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a small rectangular window cut into the log wall on the left side of the cabin, near the front corner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the regular features of a log cabin are replaced with tree-like structures with embedded glowing elements and runes, and there is no small rectangular window near the front corner as there is in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a fantastical tree-like structure with no typical building features such as doorways or windows. Therefore, there is no doorway observed to the right of a small rectangular window as it may appear in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the structure is comprised of tree trunk-like forms that blend into the ground without a visible concrete foundation, unlike Image A which shows a clear concrete base.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orientation of the building retains a similar perspective as in Image A. The structure shows its front façade facing slightly toward the right side of the image, with the left side gradually receding into the background, which is consistent with how Image A is oriented.",
