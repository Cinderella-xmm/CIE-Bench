      "question": "Are the three distinct mountain peaks—two broad and one sharp—present and positioned in the same relative layout as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the landscape has been dramatically altered to include fantastical elements such as a giant mythical creature and jagged mountain peaks that are not present in Image A.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the landscape and trails are transformed with added mystical elements like glowing lines and altered terrain due to the presence of the creature.
