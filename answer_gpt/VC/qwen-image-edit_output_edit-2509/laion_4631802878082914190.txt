{
    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image contain exactly six labeled process stages corresponding to the CRISP-DM phases?",
    "explanation": "The edited image features three labeled stages: 'Data Prodaling', 'Data Preparation', and 'Milingluda Lyuyosriny'. This is fewer than the six stages found in the typical CRISP-DM phases: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment, indicating that not all phases are present in the edited image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the six stages arranged in the correct sequential order: Business Understanding → Data Understanding → Data Preparation → Modeling → Evaluation → Deployment → back to Business Understanding?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the stages involve 'Data Prodaling', 'Data Preparation', and 'Milingluda Lyuyosriny', which do not align with CRISP-DM phases and are not arranged in any specific order involving these phases. Therefore, the stages are not in the correct sequential order as required.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a bidirectional connection (e.g., two-way path or mutual interaction) between the 'Business Understanding' and 'Data Understanding' stages?",
    "explanation": "The edited image does not feature these two stages labeled as 'Business Understanding' and 'Data Understanding'. Thus, no connections between these phases can be assessed.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a bidirectional connection (e.g., two-way path or mutual interaction) between the 'Data Preparation' and 'Modeling' stages?",
    "explanation": "The edited image contains the 'Data Preparation' stage but does not depict the 'Modeling' stage, so a bidirectional connection between the two stages cannot be analyzed within this specific image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a central data source located at the center of the diagram, accessible to all six stages?",
    "explanation": "The edited image features a crystal at the center, implying it might symbolize data. However, the crystal is not connected to all stages, nor is it representative of a typical data source accessible to all stages, given that only three stages are present. Also, the stages are not clearly connected to this central point.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the diagram include a clear return path from the 'Deployment' stage back to the 'Business Understanding' stage, completing the cycle?",
    "explanation": "The edited image does not contain any representation of the 'Deployment' or 'Business Understanding' stages, making it impossible to identify or analyze a return path completing the cycle.",
    "answer": "No"
