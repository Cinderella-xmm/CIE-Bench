      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the open umbrella retain its circular canopy shape with visible radial ribs converging at a central hub?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no umbrellas depicted at all. Instead, there is a surreal scene with floating apples and a grassy platform in a starry sky. Therefore, there is no open umbrella to feature a circular canopy or radial ribs.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the closed umbrella present with a black casing, wrist strap, and metallic tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a surreal painting-style landscape and does not contain any items resembling a closed umbrella. Thus, it does not include a black casing, wrist strap, or metallic tip.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the starlit sky with visible stars and nebulae still present as the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a visible sky with stars and a nebula, prominently displaying a stellar backdrop behind the floating island. Thus, the sky does contain these celestial features.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the scene composed with flowers in the foreground, a hill in the midground, and the sky in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a floating island format where flowers are present on the edges, apples float, and the scene is set against a starry sky, resembling a hill in the midsection with the sky extending to the background. This composition answers positively to the layout of flowers, a midground element, and a starry sky background.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the black support ribs visible and extending from the central hub to the edge of the canopy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no umbrellas in Image B, meaning there are no black support ribs or canopy features present. The elements in the image do not resemble those parts of an umbrella.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are yellow coneflowers and red poppies present in the foreground of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a variety of flowers are depicted, including some that are red and possibly yellow, but they are stylized and part of a surreal art depiction, rather than realistic flowers like yellow coneflowers and red poppies. Therefore, the presence of specific flowers like coneflowers and poppies does not apply to this heavily stylized and artistic depiction.",
