      "question": "Is the vertical facial split between black and white fur still present, dividing the face precisely down the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi dog has a mostly uniform color with no distinct vertical split between black and white fur as seen on some animals.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's eyes are large and round, characteristics of a chibi or cartoon style, and are symmetrically positioned on the face. They reflect light, as seen by the highlights in each eye, which is a common feature to enhance the cuteness factor in such designs.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
