    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the flag positioned at the top of the tallest central spire of the sandcastle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flag is clearly positioned at the top of the tallest central spire, which is a common design choice for structures to emphasize their height and center. The central positioning of the tallest spire along with the flag indicates its importance and prominence in the design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there two spiral staircases symmetrically positioned on either side of the central entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandcastle has a clear single, central spiral staircase leading up to the main entrance. There is no evidence of a second symmetrical staircase on the opposite side, which debunks the symmetry being asked about.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a central arched doorway with ornate latticework directly above it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a central arched doorway, but directly above it is a stepped structure leading upwards rather than any visible ornate latticework. The absence of specific latticework above the door in the design negates this possibility.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there at least seven conical turrets visible around the perimeter of the sandcastle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, multiple conical turrets can be seen arranged around the entire structure. Counting these turrets visually shows that there are indeed at least seven, indicating a widespread use of this architectural element within the sandcastle design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are starfish and seashells visibly present around the base of the sandcastle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, various starfish and seashells are distinctly placed around the base, adding to the decoration and maritime theme typically accompanying a sandcastle motif. Their presence adds detail and authenticity to the aesthetic.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the sandcastle designed with bilateral symmetry along its central vertical axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design of the sandcastle in Image B suggests bilateral symmetry, as features like doorways, staircases, and turret placements exhibit a mirror-like quality across a central vertical axis. Such symmetry is a common feature in architectural designs for balance and aesthetics.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there decorative carvings visible on the surfaces of the towers and archways?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Decorative carvings can be seen across the towers and archways in Image B, offering intricate design details that enhance the visual complexity and style of the sandcastle. These carvings likely include motifs fitting the sandcastle's theme and help in accentuating the ornate nature.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the tallest tower located at the center of the sandcastle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central positioning of the tallest tower is evident, marked by its prominent height relative to the surrounding turrets. This is a common design element to focus attention on the center, often used in castles and architectural structures.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
