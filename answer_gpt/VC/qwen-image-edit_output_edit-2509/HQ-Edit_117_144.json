        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues indicate the elderly man has white hair styled neatly. There is no indication of a beard, as the facial features (excluding the blurred face) do not show any additional hair. Reasoning with common portrait depictions, the lack of visible beard suggests he does not have one.",
