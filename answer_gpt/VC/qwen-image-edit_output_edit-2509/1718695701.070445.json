    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the capybara’s snout shape — including the rounded nose, wide mouth, and visible teeth — preserved in the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which is the edited image showing a sculpture, there is no visible snout that features a rounded nose, wide mouth, or visible teeth. The section where these features would exist is entirely covered by a blurred area, indicating these features are not visible or preserved in the sculpture.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the white muzzle area, positioned centrally on the face and extending from the nose to the upper lip, preserved in the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central area of the face where the white muzzle would be is covered by a blurred section, so it is not visible. Therefore, the white muzzle is not preserved in the sculpture.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the whiskers present and arranged in the same radial pattern from the snout as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are whiskers visible extending out from what should be the area of the snout. Given their presence and radial distribution, they appear consistent with typical arrangements seen in images like the original, despite the central blurred region.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the glasses positioned directly over the eyes, with the frame aligned horizontally across the bridge of the nose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the blur, I can't see where the glasses connect to the facial features like the eyes or nose. Without seeing this connection, I cannot confirm that the glasses are positioned over the eyes or aligned across the nose bridge.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sweater and shoulder straps positioned on the shoulders and torso in the same way as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows no evidence of a sweater or shoulder straps visible, showing that these elements have not been preserved in the sculpture. Without any similar clothing or features present, the original positioning is not matched.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the capybara’s head shape — rounded, broad, and proportionally large relative to the body — preserved in the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a rounded and broad head shape, but the detailed face structure can not be seen due to the blurred area. Considering only the head beyond the face, it seems to retain a similar rounded nature proportionally large relative to what body structure is visible.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the mouth depicted as slightly open, revealing the teeth, in the same manner as the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire central portion where the mouth would be located is obscured by blur, making it impossible to see whether the mouth is open or the teeth are visible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
