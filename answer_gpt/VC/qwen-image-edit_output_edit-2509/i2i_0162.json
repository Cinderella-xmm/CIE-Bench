      "question": "Does the mouse retain its brown, orange, and white fur pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mouse has a distinct fur pattern with shades of brown, orange, and white. This coloring is typical for many mice species and helps identify the mouse's natural look. Observing the edited image, these colors are still evident, maintaining the realistic appearance of the mouse.",

      "question": "Are the mouse's whiskers and large ears clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mouse features clearly visible long whiskers and prominently large ears, which are crucial for its sensory perception and are typical characteristics of a mouse. These features stand out in both a natural and edited context to convey the mouseâ€™s instincts and alertness.",

      "question": "Are the food crumbs present on the floor near the mouse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area around the mouse is scattered with small food crumbs on the floor. These crumbs are a significant element in the image as they suggest a scenario where the mouse is attracted by and possibly feeding on these crumbs; this setting is typical in depictions of mice in environments where they forage.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the mouse positioned near the crumbs and looking downward towards them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mouse in Image B is positioned close to the food crumbs and is observed looking downward in their direction. This posture indicates the mouse's engagement with the crumbs, as animals naturally look towards objects they are interested in or interacting with.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting features typical elements of a kitchen environment, with visible flooring and cabinet structures in the background. These elements are spatially and stylistically representative of a kitchen, providing context for the mouse's presence and activity in a human-inhabited space.",
