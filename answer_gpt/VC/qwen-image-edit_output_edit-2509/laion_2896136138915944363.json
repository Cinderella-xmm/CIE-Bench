    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the stylized illustration retain the scalloped pattern on the wings and back, with alternating dark and light feather edges forming a scale-like texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's illustration maintains its intricate feather detailing. The back and wings show an alternating dark and light pattern, creating a scalloped or scale-like effect. This is consistent with many bird illustrations, where details like this are emphasized to highlight texture. Comparing with Image A, the pattern is clearly preserved.",

      "question": "Is the breast and throat area rendered in a consistent peach-orange hue, distinct from the darker upper body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a bird with a peach-orange hue on the breast and throat area, which contrasts distinctly with the darker upper body. This color differentiation is typical in bird patterns to show different areas of plumage. Image A confirms this consistency, as the same color pattern is present.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the beak long, straight, and uniformly black, extending from the face without curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's beak appears long, straight, and colored uniformly black. It extend from the face without noticeable curvature, typical of many shorebird illustrations to convey their unique beak shape adapted for foraging. Image A also has this straight and uniform beak appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a clearly defined dark eye positioned near the center of the head, surrounded by lighter skin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a dark, clearly defined eye positioned near the center of the bird's head, surrounded by lighter coloration. This is a common feature in illustrations to highlight avian awareness and head shape. The analysis matches with Image A where the eye and lighter surrounding skin are similarly depicted.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's legs appear dark gray-black and end in three forward-facing toes, each with visible claws. This stance is detailed to show the bird's typical anatomy for shore wading birds. Comparing with Image A, the same leg and toe details are consistent.",
      "weight": 2,

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the bird depicted in a standing posture, with legs fully extended and body upright, as if on a shoreline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction shows the bird in a standing, upright posture with legs fully extended, a typical pose for avian illustrations to imply readiness or alertness on a shoreline. The positioning reflects back to Image A, confirming this common depiction.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there small tufts of beach grass and scattered pebbles visible in the foreground beneath the birdâ€™s feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include distinct small tufts of beach grass or scattered pebbles beneath the bird's feet. Instead, the design illustrates more abstract water patterns at the base, differentiating from a naturalistic shoreline setting. Image A shows a more realistic shoreline with these elements present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a distinct transition from the peach-orange underparts to the darker, mottled pattern on the upper body and wings. This gradient is used to emphasize the contrast between different parts of the bird's plumage, maintaining the same visual information seen in Image A.",
