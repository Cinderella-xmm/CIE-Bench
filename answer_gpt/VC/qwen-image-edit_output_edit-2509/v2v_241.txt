    "Question": "Q1: Is the horse depicted standing on the elephant's back?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show a chibi-style horse positioned directly on top of a chibi-style elephant's back. These features suggest a playful depiction, where the horse is indeed standing on the elephant. This is consistent with the clear placement of the horse's feet on the elephant's back in a stacked manner. The chibi style exaggerates features like size and proportion, maintaining the standing configuration.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the elephant shown in a posture that supports the horse on its back?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is crafted in a chibi style, with a body designed to provide a surface for the horse to stand on top of. Its back is level and wide enough in proportion to support the simplistic and stylized horse figure resting above it, ensuring adequate balance as depicted in the image. This design choice is typically made to emphasize cuteness and functionality in such stylized designs.",

    "Question": "Q3: Does the background retain a photorealistic appearance with a grassy field and sky?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a background that depicts a grassy field and a sky, similar to a real-world setting.
