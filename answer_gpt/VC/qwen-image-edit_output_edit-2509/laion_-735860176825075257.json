      "question": "Are the black-and-white half-timbered gable ends visible and positioned at the top of the central and right-side sections of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stylized illustration of a building, which prominently features a black-and-white half-timbered gable end positioned at the top of the central section of the depicted structure. This is characteristic of Tudor-style architecture, which often includes decorative timber frameworks. The right-side section also has a similar architectural style, matching the building's representation.",

      "question": "Is there a black arched door located on the left side of the building, embedded within the brick wall below the window ledge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no black arched door visible. The illustration simplifies the architectural elements and does not depict any door on the left side of the building. The focus is mainly on the central section of the fa√ßade.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Image B shows an illustration where the awning has a sign that reads 'Leeds Parkway Hotel,' which is clearly positioned directly above the main entrance doors beneath the awning, matching its placement horizontally as expected in the design.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the building without including planters or colorful flowers. Its stylized, simplified design lacks the fine details depicted in Image A, particularly those that would be seen along the base of the building or near the entrance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays windows with grid patterns that are consistent with architectural features of Tudor-style housing depicted in the illustration. However, it does not include explicit dormer or bay windows due to its simplified representation.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main entrance doors are centrally located under the awning. The illustration depicts them as double doors, similar to wooden doors with glass panels, which align with standard design features for such entrances.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the lower section of the building constructed from red brick, with an arched opening housing the black door?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B represents the building using stylized imagery that suggests a red brick lower section, but it does not include any arched opening or door, as the illustration abstracts these elements through its artistic design approach.",
