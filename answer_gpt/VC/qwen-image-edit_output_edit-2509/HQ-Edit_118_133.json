      "question": "Is the complex scrollwork and floral engraving pattern visible on the body, lid, and spout of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object does not have visible complex scrollwork or floral engraving on its body, lid, or spout. Instead, it has a smooth surface with minimal decoration—limited to some floral designs on the base. Such ornate engravings are typically intricate, with raised patterns that stand out visibly, contrasting with smooth, plain surfaces. Therefore, the observed lack of these detailed patterns on the body, lid, and spout of Image B leads to the conclusion that such engravings are not present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the object have a domed lid topped with a small finial at the apex?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object does not display a domed lid with a finial. Instead, it appears to have an open top where a candle is situated, akin to a shallow opening rather than a rounded, domelike lid. A finial is typically a decorative element sitting at the top of a dome-shaped lid, none of which are perceptible in the edited image. Therefore, this specific structural feature is absent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the object supported by a three-legged pedestal base with decorative feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the object has a single integrated base rather than a three-legged pedestal. This base is continuous with the object's body and lacks separate legs or feet, contrary to the distinct stand described in the question. A pedestal typically features multiple extended supports, not observed on the edited object.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a curved handle attached to the left side of the object, extending upward and backward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B indeed features a handle attached to its left side, extending upward and backward, complete with gold decorative elements that curve backward. Such a design is associated with handles meant for easy gripping or aesthetic presentation and is clearly discernible here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a long, curved spout extending from the right side of the object’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a spout on the right side of the object's body, characterized by its length and curvature. This is typical of designs meant for pouring fluid, remaining consistent with the description of a long, curved spout.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the object placed on a polished wooden surface with a clear reflection visible beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is positioned on a polished wooden surface, evident from the visible wood grain and shine. Additionally, there is a reflection of the object beneath, indicating both the reflective quality of the surface and the placement of the object upon it. These visual cues affirm the presence of both the surface and its reflection.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there decorative metal fittings where the handle attaches to the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handle in Image B is not connected to the body with decorative metal fittings. Instead, the handle appears seamless, with gold embellishments integrated into its design without additional fittings. Decorative fittings often involve distinct, intricate attachments visible at the juncture, not observed in this case. Therefore, such fittings are absent.",
