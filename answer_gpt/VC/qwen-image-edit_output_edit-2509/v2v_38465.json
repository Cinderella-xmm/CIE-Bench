      "question": "Is the sunset visible on the horizon with its reflection on the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sun is clearly visible on the horizon, and its reflection can be seen on the surface of the water, creating a bright, mirrored effect on the ocean waves leading towards the shore. This setup is typical in sunset images and follows common visual depictions of such scenes, indicating that the sunset is indeed visible with its reflection on the water.",

      "question": "Does the sandy beach retain its texture and extend across the bottom of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sandy beach in Image B shows visible texture typical of sand, with a grainy appearance that extends across the bottom part of the image. This texture is consistent with natural sandy beaches, which usually cover extensive areas near ocean shores, reinforcing that the sandy beach retains its texture and extends in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ocean waves present, showing natural movement near the shore?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ocean waves are depicted with lines and curves indicating movement, characteristic of natural waves approaching the beach. Such visual cues indicate the dynamic nature of ocean water as it meets the shoreline, suggesting that natural wave movement is indeed present.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the surfboards retain their original colors (yellow on the left, red and teal on the right) and upright positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two surfboards: a yellow one on the left and a red and teal one on the right, both standing upright. These colors are consistent with those specified in the prompt for the original surfboards. The upright positioning is further confirmed by their alignment and support by the pandas holding them in a standing position.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the pandas positioned similarly to the original humans, with one arm holding the surfboard and both facing the sunset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both pandas are facing the sunset with one arm outstretched to hold their respective surfboards, mirroring the position seen with the original human figures in Image A. This setup is a deliberate parallelism in both stance and activity, ensuring that the pandas are positioned similarly to the humans in the original image.",
