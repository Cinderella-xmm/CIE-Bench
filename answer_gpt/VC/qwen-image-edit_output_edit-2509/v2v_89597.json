      "question": "Is the central touchscreen still positioned in the center of the dashboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central touchscreen is visibly located on the dashboard's center, a standard placement in many contemporary vehicle interiors to ensure easy accessibility for the driver and passenger. The dashboard design cues, such as lines suggesting a horizontal span and functionality like control icons, confirm its central position. Comparing this with Image A, the touchscreen indeed occupies the same central position on the dashboard in both images.",

      "question": "Does the dashboard retain its general structure and placement relative to the steering wheel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dashboard retains its structure with a horizontal line featuring wood trim, suggesting it stretches across the vehicle interior just behind the steering wheel. This is a typical arrangement in many car designs. Comparing with Image A, the dashboard structure and its placement relative to the steering wheel remain consistent between both images.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the steering wheel still partially visible on the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the steering wheel is discernible on the left side of the touchscreen, albeit in a stylized illustration form which might obscure some details but the overall shape and position are recognizable. In Image A, the steering wheel is visible on the left side as well. The comparison reflects that both images retain this visual element in similar positions.",

      "question": "Does the overall spatial arrangement of the vehicle's interior remain consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, it showcases the interior with the touchscreen in the center, dashboard spanning across, and the visible steering wheel. This suggests that the layout and spatial interior structure of the vehicle are maintained. Comparing with Image A, it becomes evident that both images have a consistent overall spatial arrangement with these elements in similar positions.",

      "question": "Are the airflow graphics on the screen still discernible, even if represented through calligraphic strokes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the airflow graphics are shown through artistic calligraphic strokes, which are visually intricate yet retain the essence of airflow directionality and spread. Comparing with Image A, while the representation style differs, the idea of airflow on the screen is consistent and discernible.",
