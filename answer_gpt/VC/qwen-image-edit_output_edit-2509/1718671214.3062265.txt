    "Question": "Q1: Is the metallic mask with horn-like protrusions at the temples present and retaining its original shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the blurred face does not feature a metallic mask with horn-like protrusions. The colorful floral design replaces the previously existing elements, suggesting the mask is absent. The shapes and surfaces of the mask present in Image A do not appear in the edited version.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the red lips and visible lower face (including chin and jawline) clearly present and unchanged?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the blur effect over the facial area obscures details such as red lips and the lower face's chin and jawline. This alteration hides any specific characteristics relative to facial features that might have been clearly visible and unchanged in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the black hair styled in an updo with floral branches positioned symmetrically on both sides of the head?",

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are cherry blossom branches visibly integrated into the hair on both sides of the head?",
    "explanation": "Image B replaces natural cherry blossom branches seen in Image A with digitally created, bright flowers that mimic petals and floral shapes. This visual change suggests that the original cherry blossoms are no longer visible.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the subject’s facial skin tone fair and uniformly lit, matching the original?",

    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the subject facing directly forward with a symmetrical pose and centered composition?",

    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the mask retain a textured, metallic surface appearance rather than becoming smooth or cartoonish?",
    "explanation": "Any metallic mask in Image A doesn't feature in Image B as it's replaced by bright, cartoonish floral elements. The absence of metallic textures and presence of vivid colors and smooth shapes imply a change that moves away from metallic appearances.",
    "answer": "No"
