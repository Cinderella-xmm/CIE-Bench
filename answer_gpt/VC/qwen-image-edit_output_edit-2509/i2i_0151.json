      "question": "Is the kite depicted in the shape of a diamond?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kite is clearly shown in a diamond shape, which is a common design for kites, recognizable by its elongated structure with the outline resembling a rhombus. This shape is visually distinct in the edited image.",

      "question": "Does the kite retain its bright yellow color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kite in Image B is bright yellow, which is easily identifiable due to its vibrant and noticeable hue against the sky background. The color is a key feature that has been retained from Image A.",

      "question": "Are two strings visibly attached to the kite?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible string attached to the kite, typical for flying kites, but only one string is discernible, leading to the conclusion that the assumption of two strings is incorrect based on visual evidence.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B shows the kite against a clear sky, with minimal cloud interference, which is a typical setting for kite flying. This matches the common visual scenario where kites are flown.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kite in Image B is accompanied by a prominent yellow tail that extends from the bottom part of the kite, enhancing its visibility and supporting its stability in flight.",
