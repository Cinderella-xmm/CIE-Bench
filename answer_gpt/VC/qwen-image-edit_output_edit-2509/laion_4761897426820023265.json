      "question": "Is the Great Wall depicted as a continuous, zigzagging structure following the contours of the mountain ridges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Great Wall inside the snow globe is depicted as a structure that follows the natural undulations of the mountainous terrain, appearing to consistently zigzag along the ridge of the mountains. This visual cue, when combined with the common understanding of the Great Wall of China, which is known for its winding path over steep landscape, suggests that the depiction is of a continuous, zigzagging structure.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall inside the snow globe is clearly constructed from what appears to be gray stone bricks, and it is topped with crenellated battlements. These features are characteristic of traditional fortifications and align with the historical architecture of the Great Wall of China, known for its stone brick construction and battlemented top.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall within the snow globe contains structures that visually resemble watchtowers, strategically placed along the length of the wall. These are typical of the Great Wall of China's design, where watchtowers were constructed at intervals for defensive purposes and monitoring the surroundings.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, within the snow globe, the vegetation around the Great Wall is depicted with vibrant autumn colors such as yellow, orange, and red. This choice of colors is indicative of fall foliage transformations commonly observed during autumn when leaves change from green to warmer hues.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe depiction of the Great Wall includes a large, rounded rock formation visibly embedded near the right side of the wall. This is consistent with the natural landscape in the area where the Great Wall traverses, often incorporating existing geological features.",
