      "question": "Does the edited image retain the original three-section gabled roof structure with a central tower and two side wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure is composed of a central tower with a gabled roof and two side wings also featuring gabled roofs. This three-section structure is consistent with the design of a typical medieval or fantasy-style building, featuring a central and two lateral sections. Compared to Image A, this architectural design remains unchanged, confirming the original structure is retained.",

      "question": "Are the two diamond-shaped glowing windows located on the upper level of the central tower in their original positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central tower features two diamond-shaped glowing windows positioned symmetrically on either side of the upper section. This corresponds with standard window arrangements in tower structures to allow light. Examining Image A reveals the same configuration of the windows. Hence, the windows' positions remain unchanged in Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a stone chimney is clearly visible protruding from the left side of the roof on the left wing, extending upward, which is commonly seen in architecture to allow smoke to escape from fireplaces or stoves. Upon comparison with Image A, the chimney remains in its original position and form, confirming its presence.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a stack of wooden logs placed beside the right arched doorway on the ground floor. This placement is typical for storing firewood near entry points for easy access. Comparing with Image A, the logs are consistently positioned in the same location and arrangement beside the right doorway, verifying no change.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no wooden barrel hanging near the right arched doorway. Instead, a wooden barrel is seen standing on the ground to the left of the doorway. In Image A, the barrel hangs from a bracket near the doorway. This indicates a relocation from being hung to being placed on the ground.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two arched doorways are seen on the ground floor: the left one open and the right closed, reflecting typical medieval architecture favoring arch designs. Comparing to Image A, this configuration and positioning are unchanged, keeping the original doorways intact.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two green potted plants are visible, one on each side of the house. These plants likely add aesthetic value to the building's exterior. Reviewing Image A indicates the same green plants are similarly placed. Therefore, their presence remains consistent and unchanged.",
