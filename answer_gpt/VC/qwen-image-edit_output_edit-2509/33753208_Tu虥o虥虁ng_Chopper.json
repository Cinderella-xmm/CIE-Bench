    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the small structure with a blue roof still present at the highest point of the ridge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of a large, fantastical dragon dominates the composition, but the area where the small structure was located in Image A can still be seen, and the small structure with a blue roof is present at the highest point of the ridge. This analysis is based on the visible details and comparison with the original Image A where the structure is clearly visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the hikers still visible along the central trail, maintaining their original positions relative to the path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of the dragon obscures much of the trail, and no hikers are visible. In Image A, hikers are seen making their way along this path. The comparison indicates that the hikers have been either obscured or removed in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the ridge maintain its original undulating shape, forming a continuous elevated backbone from foreground to background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the dragon's presence, the underlying geography of the ridge still appears to follow a similar undulating path as in Image A. The dragon's body follows the ridge's contour, suggesting that the shape has not been fundamentally altered.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the trees and shrubs on the slopes of the ridge still present in their original locations and densities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the trees and shrubs appear to be in the same locations with similar densities, despite the superimposed image of the dragon. The background details have not been significantly altered.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sky still uniformly overcast with soft, diffused lighting, matching the original tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky appears consistent with Image A's overcast condition. The lighting in both images is soft and diffused, creating a similar atmospheric effect.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the grassy areas on both sides of the path still green and undisturbed, retaining their original texture and color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grassy areas on either side of the path remain green and do not show noticeable disturbance or alteration in texture and color when compared to Image A. This suggests that while the dragon has been added, the manipulation did not alter the grass.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the distant hills still visible in the background, fading into mist as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the distant hills are visible in the backdrop, fading into the mist much like in Image A. The atmospheric perspective created by the mist and the distant hills remains consistent across both images.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are the rocky outcrops at the lower edge of the ridge still visible in their original positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of the large dragon obstructs most of the lower edge of the ridge. Compared to Image A, where rocky outcrops are visible, they cannot be seen clearly in Image B, indicating that they may be covered or removed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
