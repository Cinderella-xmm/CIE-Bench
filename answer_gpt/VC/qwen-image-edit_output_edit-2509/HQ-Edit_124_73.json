      "question": "Is the elephant clearly visible and positioned centrally beneath the archway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is prominently positioned in the center of the composition and is directly beneath the ornate archway, serving as the focal point of the scene. This arrangement is evident from the symmetrical placement of the elephant in relation to the arch, emphasizing its central role.",

    },

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the rider seated on the elephant’s back, directly above its spine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rider in Image B is seated on the elephant at a position consistent with being directly above its spine, as suggested by the alignment of the rider along the elephant's vertical axis. This is typically where riders are positioned for balance, which is supported by the visual depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly depicts two ornately carved pillars supporting a scalloped arch, and this configuration forms a gateway in the foreground, framing the main subject of the image. The arch's elaborate design is visible and complements the scene's composition.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no marigold garlands visible on the elephant. Instead, the elephant's decorations consist of intricate patterns and jewelry-like adornments rather than marigold flowers.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are two hanging tassels (one green, one orange) visible from the arch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows one hanging tassel visible from the center of the arch, but it does not have the specific green and orange combination. Therefore, the depiction of two differently colored tassels is not present in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rider in Image B has their head facing straight forward, as indicated by the frontal positioning of their body and head alignment. The lack of sideways orientation supports the conclusion that the rider's head is not turned to the right.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a crowd of people in the background, dressed in ceremonial attire, suggesting their presence on the path or within a similarly festive environment. Their arrangement adds depth and narrative to the scene.",
