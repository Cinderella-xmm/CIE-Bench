      "question": "Does the edited image retain the bed's central alignment with a light wooden frame and neutral bedding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a bed that is centrally placed within the frame. The frame is made of light wood, which is consistent with common design principles for a neutral and calming bedroom aesthetic. The bedding is neutral, consisting of white and beige tones, which are typical for a minimalistic and modern style. This analysis is based on the visual cues that indicate the bed aligns with the central design and aesthetic of the room.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a large painting above the bed that resembles a sunset landscape. This painting is visually dominant due to its size and its central placement above the bed, which makes it a focal point in the room. Based on the visual information, the presence of such a painting strongly impacts the room's atmosphere, thus confirming that it is indeed prominently displayed.",

      "question": "Are both pendant lamps still present and retain their original positions relative to the bed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, two pendant lamps are clearly visible, hanging on either side of the bed. Their placement ensures that each lamp is symmetrically spaced relative to the edges of the bed, maintaining the balance and design harmony that is often sought in interior design. The visual symmetry and placement are consistent with typical design arrangements for bedside lighting, suggesting they have retained their original positions relative to the bed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows two nightstands on either side of the bed, both crafted from wood that visually matches the light wooden bed frame. This cohesion in material and color contributes to a uniform and harmonious design, which is a common principle in stylish bedroom setups. Based on visual inspection, the material and color consistency in the furniture confirm that the nightstands match the bed's material.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, a potted plant is visible on the left nightstand. The presence of a plant adds a natural element to the room's decor, commonly used to enhance a space's aesthetic and bring a touch of nature indoors. Visual confirmation of the plant in its position on the left nightstand indicates that it remains there.",
