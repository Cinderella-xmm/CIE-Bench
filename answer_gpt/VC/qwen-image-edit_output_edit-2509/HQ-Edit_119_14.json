      "question": "Is the full white beard present on the figureâ€™s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image provides a view of a figure dressed in classic period attire with a top hat and formal suit, standing confidently. Given the figure's attire and posture, the presence of a full white beard would be distinctive around the facial area below the top hat. However, visual cues in the image do not show a beard characteristic, like white hair around the jaw and chin area; thus, based on typical facial features and grooming styles, there is no indication of a full white beard.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a red or dark tilak mark positioned between the eyebrows on the forehead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The attire and styling, featuring a top hat and formal suit jacket, suggest a Western formal fashion context which typically does not include cultural marks such as tilak between the eyebrows. Based on visual examination, no such marks or adornments are visible or customary in this style of presentation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the figure displaying an open-mouthed smile showing teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In assessing the subject's expression, we aim to identify characteristics typical of a smile, especially an open-mouthed one which would show teeth. Based on the visible cues, including body language and typical facial expressions in formal attire, there is no indication of an open-mouthed smile showing teeth, which would visibly alter the mouth area significantly.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the figure standing upright with arms relaxed at the sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pose and background suggest a classic, formal stance typical of portraitures where the individual stands upright with a relaxed demeanor. Observing the alignment and posture, the arm position is consistent with a relaxed yet confident stance, supported by traditional composition method used in portraits.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining the framing of the image, the shot captures the figure from head to approximately the waist area, suggesting a half-body view. The placement within the frame is linear and centered partially but does not encompass a full-body view generally observable from head to toe.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observation of the visible facial region and general depiction in the artistic style aligns with portraying realistic textures and tones associated with portraits in classical styles. However, skin tone and facial texture details are not discernible due to stylistic depiction meant to deliver an idealized look typical of painted portraits, thus nuanced natural textures may not feature prominently.",
