      "question": "Does the edited image retain the child's original shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child appears to be reaching out in a similar fashion to Image A. The position and posture of the child, notably the arm reaching towards the balloon, is consistent between the two images, though some artistic liberties might result in minor visual differences due to the tile-like design in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the round red balloon retained in its original shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the round red balloon maintains its position atop the child's head and retains its round shape similar to Image A. The style change doesn't alter the balloon's essential features like shape and relative position.",

      "question": "Is the heart-shaped balloon retained in its original shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "The heart-shaped balloon in Image B keeps its distinctive heart shape and position relative to the child as depicted in Image A. The difference in artistic style does not affect the positioning or basic form of the balloon.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child continues to reach towards the heart-shaped balloon, mirroring the pose found in Image A. The positioning of the child's arm and hand indicates the intent to touch or reach the balloon, which is consistent across both images.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the child, the round red balloon, and the heart-shaped balloon are arranged in the same relative positions. Specifically, the round red balloon is positioned above the child, and the heart-shaped balloon is extended away in the child's line of reach.",
