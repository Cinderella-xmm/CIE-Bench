        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono displays pink cherry blossom designs along its fabric. These designs include black outlines that represent branches, providing a stylized depiction that is common in floral kimono patterns.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no pink cherry blossoms visible hanging from above in the background. The edited image contains a more structured background that includes floral motifs as cut-out patterns around the mask but not hanging blossoms, thus indicating a planarity of backdrop rather than overhead decoration.",
