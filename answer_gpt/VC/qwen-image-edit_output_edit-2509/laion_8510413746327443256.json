        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the watch in Image B, there is a clearly visible digital crown on the right side of the watch case. The crown is circular and slightly protrudes, aligning with traditional smart watch designs where such functional elements are typically located for ease of access and navigation.",

        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is an absence of any small button beneath the digital crown on the watch's right side.

      "explanation": "In Image B, the band is attached to both the left and right sides of the watch case, which is a common configuration for wristwatches to ensure stability and comfort. The band design here resembles a segmented metallic look with intricate details, but it maintains the traditional attachment points to the watch case.",
