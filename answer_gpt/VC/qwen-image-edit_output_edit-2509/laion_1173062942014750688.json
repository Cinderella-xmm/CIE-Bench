      "question": "Are the blue circular spots present on the serpent’s body, positioned as eyes or eye-like features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent features blue circular spots on its body, positioned strategically to resemble eyes or eye-like features. The spots are distinctly visible and integrated into the serpent’s design to act as a visual enhancement, commonly associated with eye-like patterns, especially given their placement and visual prominence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the red and yellow colors form the primary scale patterns along the serpent’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, red and yellow are dominant colors visible throughout the serpent’s body, forming distinct contrasting patterns that resemble scales. These colors appear in large, noticeable portions, functioning as the primary hues in the serpent's scale-like pattern, supported by the visual prominence and coloration.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the black zigzag or spotted patterns visible as tribal markings on the serpent’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent does not exhibit black zigzag or spotted patterns in a manner that could be interpreted as tribal markings. Instead, the design features intricate tribal-like detailing, but not specifically black zigzags or spots. The visual cues suggest an ornate, stylistic pattern rather than traditional tribal patterning.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the segments of the serpent’s body shaped like spheres or near-spheres, reflecting the original bead form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent is depicted as a continuous, cohesive figure without distinct spherical or near-spherical segments. The body forms seamless curves, departing from the bead-like spherical form shown in Image A, suggesting a holistic serpent shape rather than discrete, bead-like sections.",
      "weight": 2,

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the surface of the serpent retain a matte, slightly uneven texture resembling hand-painted craftsmanship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B reveals a surface that appears smooth and polished, lacking the matte, uneven texture typically associated with hand-painted craftsmanship. The design of the serpent depicts clear, vibrant colors and smooth transitions indicative of a refined finish rather than a traditional, handmade appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the colors red, yellow, blue, black, and white all present in the serpent’s body, maintaining the original palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent displays a variety of colors including red, yellow, and blue prominently on its patterned body. The presence of black detailing and traces of lighter shades, inferred to be white or similar, complete the palette, resembling the wide range of colors from Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the patterns on the serpent’s body irregular and varied from segment to segment, matching the original bead diversity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the pattern on the serpent's body shows consistency and integration that do not reflect the irregular and varied nature seen in the beads of Image A. The serpent's patterns are uniform and repeat along its body, deviating from the diverse and varied bead design.",
