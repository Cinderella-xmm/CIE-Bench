    "Question": "Q1: Does the butterfly retain its original iridescent electric blue wing color?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's wings are colored in a vivid and bright electric blue, consistent with the description of the original butterfly's color. This color choice helps maintain the distinct and recognizable appearance of a Morpho butterfly, a common representation in biology diagrams due to its striking blue. Therefore, the original iridescent electric blue color is retained.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the dark black edges along the outer margins of the butterflyâ€™s wings preserved?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's wings have distinct dark black edges along the margins. This feature is a typical depiction in biological diagrams to show the wing structure of butterflies, as it provides contrast and definition against the blue wing color.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the butterfly depicted with both wings fully extended and symmetrically open?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the butterfly with both wings extended in a fully open and symmetrical manner. This is a common posture for illustrating butterflies in scientific diagrams as it provides a clear view of the wing patterns and coloring, which are important identification features.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the bright pink cosmos flower directly beneath the butterfly still present and clearly visible?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the primary focus is on the butterfly and conceptual labels. There is no depiction of a cosmos flower beneath the butterfly. Instead, the layout focuses on labeling parts and biological features.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the yellow stamens forming the central disc of the pink flower visible?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no presence of a pink flower to display yellow stamens or a central disc. The focus is on the labeled elements and aspects of butterfly biology, with no representation of flowers in the immediate vicinity.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the butterfly physically touching the surface of the pink flower?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no interaction between the butterfly and a pink flower because the flower itself is not depicted. The butterfly is part of an educational schematic without reference to physical interaction with any flower.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are multiple unopened pink flower buds visible around the main flower?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not include any depiction of multiple unopened pink flower buds. The focus is entirely on the butterfly and the educational labels, with no floral elements presented in the scene.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Is the background composed of softly blurred green leaves, maintaining a natural garden ambiance?",
    "explanation": "Image B's background is a plain, neutral color, which is typical for scientific diagrams as they focus on clarity and readability. The background does not maintain a natural garden ambiance as seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
