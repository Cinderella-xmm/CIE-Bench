      "question": "Is the cluster of purple grapes visible in the basket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the basket held by the woman under her left arm contains a variety of fruit. Among them, a visible cluster of purple grapes is easily identifiable by their characteristic round shape and color, typical of grapes.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the small terracotta jug held by the woman has distinct engravings. However, these engravings do not resemble a heart shape, as the intricate designs present appear to have different geometric or symbolic patterns that differ from a heart shape.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the goose accompanying the figurine has a body adorned with gold floral patterns rather than plain white. This differs from the common depiction of a goose, which would typically feature a plain white body, orange beak, and webbed feet, but here, these colors aren't distinguishable due to the pattern overlay.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neckline of the woman's cloak is visually clear. However, there is no gold-colored clasp visible in that area. Typically, a clasp would be prominent as it serves as a decorative element, but in this image, there is no such feature identifiable at her neckline.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the contents of the basket held by the woman are visible. We can confirm the presence of a red apple, identified by its shape and color, and purple grapes; however, there is no green pear visible in the basket. Therefore, the basket does not contain all three specified fruits.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the basket is seen cradled under the woman's left arm and positioned approximately at her waist level. This placement is typical when holding a basket in such a manner, especially when considering the positioning and job of holding fruits for display.",
