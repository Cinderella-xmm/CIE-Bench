      "question": "Does the zebra retain its black-and-white stripe pattern without significant alteration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra prominently features its characteristic black-and-white stripes, which are distinct and unaltered. This pattern is a defining trait of zebras and remains unchanged in the edited image. The visual cues in Image B confirm that the zebra's stripe pattern remains authentic and intact.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the zebra still in its original standing posture facing slightly towards the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra continues to stand in a posture that points slightly to the right, as evidenced by its overall body orientation. This posture matches the typical stance seen in zebras where they might be alert or curiously observing their surroundings. Image A also displays the zebra in a similar posture, confirming the consistency of the zebra's pose between both images.",

      "question": "Is the second zebra partially visible behind the first one, preserving its placement in the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the second zebra appears partially visible behind the first zebra, similar to Image A. In Image A, the second zebra is seen from the right side as its rear half is visible behind the first zebra. This placement is maintained in Image B, where the second zebra appears in the same position relative to the first zebra.",

      "question": "Does the image still feature a grassy savannah background with some scattered vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B introduces a dramatic change in the background, now showcasing an urban skyline with tall buildings, which is distinctly different from the grassy savannah seen in Image A. The savannah setting common to zebras in natural habitats is absent, replaced by elements typically associated with urban environments, such as skyscrapers.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the zebras' relative sizes, proportions, and perspectives maintained as seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras' sizes, proportions, and spatial orientation relative to each other appear consistent with those in Image A. Their positioning and the way they occupy the space in the frame do not seem to have undergone any noticeable alterations, suggesting a preservation of their original proportions and visual relationship to each other.",
