      "question": "Is the subject’s hair light blonde in color and visibly full and styled upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hair is depicted as light blonde with an exaggerated, very full volume styled upward in a dramatic fashion. This is indicative of a cartoonish or caricature style where features are often exaggerated. The light blonde color and the distinct styling are clear visual cues.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the subject have a prominent forehead and wide jawline that define the facial structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject’s facial structure, while blurred, is suggested through the exaggerated style of the graphic depiction. The hair is emphasized, but specific features like a prominent forehead and jawline are implied through the cartoonish style, creating a wide, bold facial structure typical in caricatures.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the subject’s right hand raised with the palm facing outward and fingers spread in a waving motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the position of the hand is unmistakably shown with the right hand raised, palm out, and fingers spread in a waving gesture. This is a common animated style for depicting waving, easily visible in the cartoon elements of the image.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a necktie visible under the suit jacket, positioned at the front of the shirt collar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a necktie is clearly visible, drawn in vibrant colors with a pattern that stands out against the shirt, adhering to vibrant and exaggerated cartoon stylization. Its position at the front of the shirt collar is a basic aspect of formal wear depiction.",
      "weight": 2,

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the subject wearing a dark formal suit jacket over a white shirt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit jacket is not dark but instead ornately patterned and colorful, adhering to the exaggerated style of the cartoon scene. The shirt beneath is white, providing contrast typical of formal cartoon attire but still largely deviating from a typical dark formal jacket.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the blurred facial area, determining the exact direction of the eyes in Image B is not possible. The artistic nature might imply forward direction, which is common in such framed drawings, but specifics cannot be concluded.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the subject positioned centrally or slightly to the right of the frame, appearing to move forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is indeed positioned centrally, slightly to the right, in the frame. The subject appears to be moving forward, suggested by the forward-facing position in the animated depiction and crowd orientation, which is typical in scenes of public appearances in artwork.",
