    "Question": "Q1: Are the irises of the eyes still blue?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features, including the eyes, are blurred, making it impossible to visually discern the color of the irises. Without additional information on the facial details, it would be speculative to confirm any specific color like blue for the irises.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the facial structure, including the nose, jawline, and cheekbones, unchanged?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the face is blurred which obscures the ability to evaluate specific facial features like the nose, jawline, or cheekbones. Due to this blurring, any assertion about them being unchanged would be speculative.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the subject positioned with a slight leftward turn of the body while facing forward?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the subject in a robotic outfit. The body appears to be facing mostly forward with a slight turn, which could be interpreted as a leftward angle, based on the positioning of her shoulder armor. This suggests a nuanced orientation, supporting the slight leftward body turn while maintaining a forward facing direction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are both arms positioned naturally at the sides of the body?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the subject in a futuristic, armored outfit that doesnâ€™t display the full length of the arms or their positioning. Observing the implied lines of the outfit, the shoulders seem relaxed, suggesting the arms may be positioned at the sides, which typically indicates a natural stance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the skin tone consistent with a natural light complexion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the skin is not visible as the image is edited with the blurred face. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately assess or affirm the skin tone being of a natural light complexion.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the lips closed in a neutral expression?",
    "explanation": "Given the face is blurred out in Image B, the specific expression, including closed lips, cannot be identified reliably, preventing an accurate assessment of the facial expression.",
    "answer": "No"
