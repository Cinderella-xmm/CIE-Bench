    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a river running down the center of the image from the foreground to the distant mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a series of parallel lines extends from the foreground towards the mountains in the background, resembling the pattern of a river. The lines suggest movement that mimics water flow from close to far away. Hence, these lines visually suggest a river running through the image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there two large mountain peaks visible in the background, one on the left and one on the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows stylized triangular shapes on both the left and right sides of the horizon line, reminiscent of mountain peaks. These shapes and their placement indicate the presence of two distinct mountainous formations anchoring each side of the image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a bright circular light source positioned near the center of the horizon line in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a large, prominent circular shape is visible near the center of the image, above the mountains. This shape, especially in its radial design, resembles a sun or similar bright light source positioned on the horizon.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there trees present on both sides of the river, extending along the banks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, conical shapes and rounded clusters that resemble trees are positioned on both sides of the central lines indicating a river. These visual cues suggest that treelines are flanking the river on both sides.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible rock formations or landmasses within the river, breaking the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any interruptions or formations within the series of parallel lines indicating a river. The design is smooth and uninterrupted, implying an absence of rocks or landmasses breaking the surface of the river.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the river reflect the trees and sky above it, maintaining a mirrored image across the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the river appears as a series of stylized lines without specific reflections of trees or sky above it. The design does not convey a mirroring effect typically seen in water reflections.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the trees on the riverbanks colored in warm autumn tones such as red, orange, and yellow, with dark green conifers interspersed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the imagined trees are predominantly rendered in warm tones, with shades like orange and yellow visible. The presence of dark green triangular shapes implies the inclusion of conifers. This matches the description of trees in warm autumn colors mixed with conifers.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
