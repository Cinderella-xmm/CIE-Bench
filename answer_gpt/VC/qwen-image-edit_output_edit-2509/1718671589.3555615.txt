    "Question": "Q1: Is the central dome present and positioned directly above the main structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central dome is clearly visible and centrally placed above the main cubic-shaped structure of the building, which is typical for dome architecture as it often signifies the roof or crown of a significant building. The symmetrical placement suggests structural balance.",
