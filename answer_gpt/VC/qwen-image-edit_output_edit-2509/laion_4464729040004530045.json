    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the woman in the edited image positioned in a three-quarter profile view, facing to the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is standing with her body angled slightly, showing part of her left shoulder towards the camera. Her position indicates a three-quarter profile view, facing slightly to the left. This pose suggests that more of her left side is visible while her right side is less shown.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the woman’s head tilted downward in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orientation of the woman's head appears to be upright or slightly forward, which suggests a natural position without significant downward tilt observed through the alignment of the neck and shoulders.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the woman’s arms positioned at her sides in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's arms are not fully at her sides. Her right arm is slightly bent at the elbow, bringing her hand to the front, while her left arm is resting naturally to the side. Her arm posture does not strictly adhere to being positioned entirely at her sides.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the woman have white nail polish on her fingernails in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's hands are visible, and her fingernails appear to be covered with white gloves rather than nail polish, making it impossible to determine the color or presence of nail polish.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's body and head position suggest she is oriented slightly towards the left, inferred by the angle of her shoulders and the direction her body is angled.",
