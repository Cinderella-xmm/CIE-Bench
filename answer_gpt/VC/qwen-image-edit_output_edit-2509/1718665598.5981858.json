    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a long, continuous road-like structure extending into the distance, serving as the central axis of the composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central axis of the composition is formed by a road-like structure that stretches into the distance. This is visible through the lines representing the road's edges and the continuous central line. The perspective of the scene and the alignment of other elements like trees and poles support this interpretation. Such structures are commonly used to guide the viewer's eye in visual art, representing continuity and leading into depth.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible diagonal streaks or patterns indicating falling rain across the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edit transforms the scene into an abstract, geometric representation. There are no visible diagonal streaks or patterns that suggest falling rain. The use of polygons and flat colors eliminates any indication of weather phenomena such as rain, as opposed to Image A where such a pattern would be evident through artistic techniques representing rain.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there tall vertical structures with horizontal crossbars positioned along the right side of the road?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays tall, vertical structures resembling utility poles with horizontal crossbars on the right side of the road. These are depicted using simplified geometrical shapes, consistent with how utility poles are typically represented in abstract art. The arrangement indicates utility poles, which are common alongside roads for electrical or telecommunication purposes.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there tree-like forms present on both sides of the road, aligned with the guardrails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are forms that suggest trees, aligning with the guardrails and depicted through triangular or polygonal shapes. These simplified geometric representations align with the typical tree shapes in abstract or stylized artwork. This characteristic is visually represented in the scene, reflecting common artistic interpretation of trees' presence next to roadways.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a visible division in the sky between dark clouds and a brighter, illuminated area near the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the use of geometric patterns and colors creates a separation in the sky, with sections that appear darker and others lighter, near the horizon. Although the artistic technique differs from a realistic depiction, the color contrast and placement suggest a division between dark and brighter areas. This is similar to how one might interpret a sky transitioning from stormy to clear conditions in a stylized form.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there barrier-like structures running along both edges of the road?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, barrier-like shapes are present on both sides of the road. These are abstracted into linear forms, indicative of guardrails or road barriers. Such elements are typical in road scenes to enhance safety, depicted here in an artistic, simplified style consistent with the rest of the geometric composition.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a continuous yellow line running down the center of the road?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a continuous yellow line is visible running along the center of the road, a common road marking in many countries indicating lane divisions or no-pass zones. Its presence is crucial in the composition, helping maintain the visual coherency of the 'road' concept even within the abstract and geometric aesthetic.",
