      "question": "Does the bird retain its bright yellow plumage with orange accents on its wings and tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is prominently bright yellow, but upon inspection, there are no visible orange accents on its wings and tail. The bird appears uniformly yellow in the presented image. This assessment is based on directly observing Image B and matching it with known characteristics of similar birds, but without any visible orange tones in the wings or tail.",

      "question": "Is the bird depicted as perched, even if on a different surface like a balcony railing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is clearly shown perched on what seems to be a balcony railing. The pose and balance suggest a stable perch, typical for small birds. The direct observation of the railing and the bird's posture confirms that it is indeed perched.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the bird with an open beak, displaying an interior with a pink hue, which is visible against its yellow plumage. This is consistent with the structure observed where the beak is open and a pink tone is visible within.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture of the bird's feathers appears detailed and realistic, exhibiting the usual soft and layered look expected of feathers. Additionally, the eye is sharp and well-defined, showing a glossy and reflective surface, which is an indicator of detailed depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bird in Image B is shown with its claws gripping the edge of the balcony railing. They appear naturally arched and bent around the surface, which is consistent with a perching grip. This natural position of the claws is typical for birds when they are perched or standing securely on a surface.",
