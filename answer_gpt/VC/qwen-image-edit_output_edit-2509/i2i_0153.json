      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck is depicted with large areas colored in vivid red, specifically on the cab and fenders, which visually predominate over other colors. Red is the most prominent color as it occupies the largest portion of space on the truck's body, which is consistent with world knowledge about identifying dominant colors based on space occupation. Therefore, the truck remains predominantly red.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a noticeable chrome exhaust pipe on the side of the truck, characterized by its shiny metallic appearance and typical cylindrical shape. Large chrome exhaust pipes are familiar features on such trucks for dispersing exhaust gases. The edited image maintains this feature, thus confirming the presence of the chrome exhaust pipe.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels are appropriately aligned with their positions relative to the truck's chassis, and they feature the typical large, robust appearance expected for a truck of this kind. The wheels have visible lug nuts, which are common in real-world vehicular designs to secure wheels to the axle. Therefore, the wheel positioning and features are accurately represented.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a front grille with distinct vertical slats arranged evenly across the grille. Additionally, there is a central emblem, which is a typical design element found in many vehicle grilles to signify brand identity. Based on these observations, the front grille continues to have the vertical slats and central emblem.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates large windows on the truck's cab that are well-defined and prominently positioned, consistent with real-life trucks that feature large windows for visibility. The chrome side mirror is also visible, exhibiting the typical reflective and metallic characteristics expected from such mirrors. Therefore, both elements are present and appropriately situated.",
