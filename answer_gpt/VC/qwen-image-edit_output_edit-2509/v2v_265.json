      "question": "Is the rectangular grille located at the front center of the locomotive present in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the locomotive is cartoonish and simplified, lacking realistic details like grilles. In contrast, Image A depicts an industrial train with a detailed rectangular grille, typical for real locomotives. Understanding train design helps conclude that such grilles are standard features. Therefore, the original image features the grille.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a single illuminated orange-yellow headlight on the front of the locomotive in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cartoon locomotive with an exaggerated, bright headlight centered on its front. Common locomotive design includes a headlight, which Image A also displays as a glowing feature. Based on this common design knowledge, we confirm the original image includes this element.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there metal handrails on the front bumper of the locomotive in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's cartoon style depicts simple, likely decorative lines suggesting handrails. Image A shows clear, functional metal handrails, typical of real industrial locomotives, for safety and maintenance reasons. This comparison supports that such handrails are present in the original image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a circular object mounted on the roof of the locomotive’s cab in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon design includes a symmetric circular structure, which can be mistaken as a whimsical feature. Image A displays a realistic locomotive with machinery commonly seen in industrial settings. However, the cab itself is streamlined without a notable circular object. Thus, the original image lacks such a feature.",

      "question": "Are multiple intersecting railway tracks visible beneath the locomotive in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a simple, single rail reflecting its cartoon style, lacking complexity. Image A’s industrial setting, with multiple intersecting tracks, is common in train yards, facilitating train movement and switching. World knowledge of train operations and the visual complexity in the original photo affirm the presence of intersecting tracks.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is simple with fields and flowers, typical for a playful, clean cartoon. Conversely, Image A shows a realistic setting with multiple freight cars on tracks, expected in a train yard. Recognizing this common industrial scene confirms their presence in the original image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's cartoon setting features clean tracks surrounded by flowers. In contrast, Image A shows an industrial yard with gritty, muddy terrain and scattered debris, a frequent sight in areas with heavy machinery. This stark difference, recognized from typical train yard conditions, confirms the original image's state.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a clear, sunny sky typical of cheerful cartoons. Image A, depicting a more industrial environment, shows a hazy, gray sky, likely due to atmospheric conditions or pollution common in industrial zones. This comparison, supported by the haze often associated with such settings, confirms the original image's sky characteristics.",
