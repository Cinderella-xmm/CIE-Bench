      "question": "Are the bananas represented with their characteristic elongated curve and yellow color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cartoonish depiction of bananas hanging from a holder. These bananas are represented with an elongated curve and are colored yellow, which adheres to the typical characteristics of bananas as we commonly know them. This depiction easily aligns with the general representation and understanding of bananas, which are commonly known for their yellow color and curved shape.",

      "question": "Is the banana holder depicted with a curved metal arm supported by a wooden base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the banana holder is illustrated as having a curved metal arm that is attached to what appears to be a wooden base. This follows an exaggerated and stylized cartoon form, but it maintains the core features of a curved metal arm and a base that simulates a wood finish. It is in line with what a banana holder typically looks like in reality.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the bananas still rest naturally on the curved metal arm?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the depiction is cartoon-like, the bananas are shown hanging from the curved metal arm of the holder. This position mimics the natural way bananas rest when they are hung on a banana stand. Despite the whimsical nature of the drawing, the bananas' placement is consistent with how gravity affects them when hung.",

      "question": "Are the bananas shown in a bunch, connected at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image displays the bananas as a pair clearly connected at the top, which is a common feature of how bananas grow in bunches. This characteristic is preserved in the cartoon style of Image B, maintaining the traditional presentation of bananas as seen in reality.",

      "question": "Does the wooden base of the banana holder retain its wood-like texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the banana holder is drawn in a simple cartoon style, and it does not exhibit an actual wood-like texture. Instead, it is simply outlined and colored to suggest a base but lacks any detailed texture to indicate wood grain, which is commonly associated with real wood surfaces. Thus, the image does not retain the wood-like texture.",
