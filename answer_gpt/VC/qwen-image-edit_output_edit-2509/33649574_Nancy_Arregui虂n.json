      "question": "Is the rooster’s comb present on top of its head in a prominent, upright position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a bright flame-like feature on the rooster's head that visually resembles the comb of a rooster due to its prominent and upright position. This design element is consistent with the visual and common knowledge of how a rooster's comb appears.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red fleshy wattles visible under the rooster’s beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rooster's design is stylized with flames and mythical colors, and traditional fleshy wattles under the beak are not visible. Instead, the design focuses more on fiery elements, deviating from realistic anatomy.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rooster’s beak is stylized but visible, positioned at the front of its head, and maintains a pointed shape, consistent with the typical structure of a rooster’s beak.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the rooster is heavily stylized, it maintains the anatomical correctness of having two legs with three forward-facing toes and one rear toe on each foot, which is typical for birds including roosters.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rooster's posture is upright with its head raised, similar to a proud or confident stance. The positioning of the legs indicates one foot is slightly forward, enhancing this upright, alert posture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the tail positioned at the rear of the rooster’s body and extending upward in a curved shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rooster’s tail is highly stylized with a fiery appearance, flowing upward in a curved manner similar to a natural rooster’s tail but with an artistic twist. This maintains the essence of the tail positioning typically found at the rear and extending upwards.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B replaces traditional feathers with vibrant, fiery designs, the overall shape and color placement mimic overlapping feathers with a mix of gold and orange hues, closely resembling a stylized alternative to a real rooster’s feather arrangement.",
