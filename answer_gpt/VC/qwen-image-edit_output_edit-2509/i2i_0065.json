      "question": "Is the white marking on the dog's snout and muzzle clearly visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white marking is clearly visible on the dog's snout and muzzle, contrasting against the black areas of the face. This contrast is evident because the edited image features a sculpture with precise detailing in color separation, allowing the white markings to stand out distinctly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dog still have a predominantly black coat with clear contrast against the white markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the dog as a sculpture with a predominantly black coat, and the contrast against the white markings is clearly defined. The sculpture effectively uses color differentiation to maintain the dog's original coat pattern.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the dog depicted in a relaxed yet alert posture in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is depicted in a sculptural form that captures a posture suggestive of a relaxed yet alert demeanor. The upright posture, combined with the forward-facing position, indicates an alertness while the overall static form represents relaxation, as is typical in a museum setting where sculptures are posed to depict specific expressions or attitudes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B accurately positions the dog's ears in a normal relation to its head, with a realistic alignment that reflects the typical ear posture for this breed.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the dog's eyes retain their reflective quality in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's eyes in the sculpture are depicted without the reflective quality seen in real eyes. Sculptures typically lack the dynamic reflection present in living creatures. Instead, the eye area is represented with more matte features, lacking the sheen that provides reflective qualities.",
