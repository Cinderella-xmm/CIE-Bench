      "question": "Is the pencil blue in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pencil is drawn in a digital style with a blue barrel. The color is consistent and clearly visible, indicating the pencil is indeed blue. Common sense dictates that the visual representation of color in illustrations is usually intentional and distinct.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the yellow paper have clean edges and a uniform color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a digitally illustrated yellow paper with clean, straight edges that are sharply defined, reflecting the controlled nature of digital drawing. The color of the paper is a uniform yellow, which is typical in illustrations to maintain visual uniformity and focus.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the pencil's tip visibly touching the yellow paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pencil is depicted such that its tip is closely against the surface of the yellow paper. This is illustrated by the position of the pencil in relation to the paper, implying a contact point, even though the drawn style may not clearly depict physical connections as a real-world photo would.",

      "question": "Is there a blurred silver laptop in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a laptop is present in the background, but it is drawn in a sketch-like style with visible line outlines. Unlike an actual blurred photo, this portrayal focuses more on stylistic representation rather than realistic blurring. This suggests the absence of a blurred silver laptop.",

      "question": "Is the pencil's tip visibly sharp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pencil's tip is drawn to suggest a pointed end, typical of a pencil, although the digital style limits hyper-realistic sharpness. Nevertheless, it is conveyed as sharp, adhering to common visual cues of a sharpened pencil in illustrations.",
