      "question": "Are the silhouettes of the man and woman still positioned side by side on the bench after the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two figures are visible on the bench, but instead of normal human features, they are shown as crystal-like silhouettes. These figures maintain the general size, form, and side-by-side positioning indicative of a couple seated on a bench, which is consistent with typical human seating in such scenarios. This indicates that the intended position related to companionship and parallel seating is preserved.",

      "question": "Is the park bench still present in the same design and position beneath the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the bench is clearly visible beneath the tree in the same position as in Image A. The design, characterized by its backrest and armrests, remains unchanged, consistent with the typical form of a park bench, which is a stable and unmoving structure generally found in parks.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the large tree with green leaves still visible above the couple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a tree with a visible trunk and branches extending overhead, adorned with green leaves. This scene is similar to what is commonly seen in park environments, indicating that the tree is still there as an important part of the setting's visual arrangement.",

      "question": "Is the grassy field still visible as the backdrop behind the bench?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area behind the bench reveals an expanse of green, resembling a well-maintained grassy field stretching into the distance. This corresponds to typical park backdrops, which include open grassy fields behind seating areas, confirming the field is still part of the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image still depict early morning or late afternoon lighting with soft diffusion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B exhibits a soft quality, with gentle sun rays illuminating the scene, a characteristic often associated with early morning or late afternoon. This time of day usually produces such soft lighting due to the lower angle of the sun, resulting in long shadows and a warmer light, matching the visual cues seen here.",
