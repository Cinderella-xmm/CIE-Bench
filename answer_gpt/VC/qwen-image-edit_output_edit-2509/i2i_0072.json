        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl's arms are extended outward in a manner that suggests she is involved in an action like catching or throwing. This is similar to Image A, where her arms are also positioned in a way that suggests a throwing motion. The posture in terms of arm position appears consistent between the two images, indicating that the overall posture related to the potential action of throwing is retained.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl is wearing a red dress with a polka-dot pattern, which closely matches the attire visible in Image A. Both images display a similar red dress with an identical pattern, showcasing that this aspect of her clothing is maintained in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the background has been altered to a sci-fi setting, the girl remains prominently in the foreground, similar to how she is positioned in Image A against the original background. Her position in relation to the background elements maintains her prominence and foreground positioning.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl is standing on a circular platform within a sci-fi environment, which is analogous to the way she is standing on a stone in Image A. While the platform's appearance has changed to fit the new theme, the concept of her standing on a raised object remains the same.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl's hands are extended outward, indicating an action such as throwing or reaching. This matches the posture of her arms in Image A, where they are also extended in a similar fashion. Therefore, the position of her arms and hands suggesting an active gesture is retained.",
