    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there two female figures present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, four figures are discernible as they are all standing against a backdrop, with identifiable silhouettes suggesting their presence. Combining the visual cues with world knowledge that figures can be discerned based on certain visual characteristics such as clothing or posture, it's evident that there are four figures.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the two figures positioned symmetrically relative to the central axis of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The layout in Image B suggests that the figures are not positioned symmetrically. Although maintaining a central structure might imply symmetry, here, one female figure is notably centered, while the others are aligned in such a way that doesn't suggest symmetry relative to one central axis.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a large central dome visible at the end of the pathway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of architectural elements such as domes is visible, which are integral to the backdrop of the image. The characteristic shape and position of these elements suggest that a large central dome is part of the structure in the image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there an arched stone entrance framing the view of the central structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features arches that frame the overall design, indicative of specific architectural arrangements. These arches serve to encase the main area of focus, suggesting an arched entrance framing the view seen in traditional architecture.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a straight water channel running from the foreground to the central structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not appear to have a water channel that runs directly from the foreground to the central structure. Instead, there is a mosaic design that does not accommodate this geographical feature.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the sarees retain a dominant red and gold color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The saree in Image B features a vivid array of colors with visible reds and golds. This indicates that they maintain a consistent color scheme, which can be concluded from the traditional use of these appealing colors for such attire.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are gold jewelry pieces, including a forehead ornament (maang tikka) and earrings, visible on both figures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes adornments such as earrings, which highlight the traditional jewelry worn with sarees. However, without a visible presence of a maang tikka, the set of jewelry pieces is incomplete.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Do both figures have long, dark hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central female figure appears to have long, dark hair. Other surrounding figures do not specifically display indicators of hair length or color, suggesting a lack of consistent feature as posed by the question.",
