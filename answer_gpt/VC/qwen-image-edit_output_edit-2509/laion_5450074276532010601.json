    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the \"Schildkröt\" brand name visible on the ball box and/or paddle surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which is a cartoonish illustration, the focus is on the characters which are personified paddles and not on any real product branding. The 'Schildkröt' brand name isn't illustrated or intended to be the focus here. The illustration does not depict a ball box or a paddle with branding as found in realistic images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the paddles clearly depicted with one red rubber surface and one blue rubber surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the paddles are anthropomorphized characters with a red and a blue face, indicating they are colored similarly to standard ping pong paddle rubbers. This cartoon illustration doesn't explicitly show typical paddle rubber surfaces but implies colors through character design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a diamond-shaped logo present on the handle of each paddle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, being a cartoon illustration, there is no focus on such specific details as logos on paddles. The handles of the paddles are simplified and do not feature detailed logos like in realistic depictions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are exactly two paddles included in the set?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two paddles are illustrated as characters, suggesting a pair, although they are not part of a 'set' in the traditional sense of a physical product. Their depiction as animated figures implies a duo, consistent with the idea of two paddles.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is a rope handle visibly attached to the left side of the box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a physical box with a rope handle, as it is a cartoonish scene depicting an adventure theme with chest-like elements rather than a realistic box representation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a horizontal partition inside the box that separates and holds the paddles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include a depiction of a box's interior with partitions. It shows a treasure chest theme with anthropomorphic paddles inside, lacking the realistic detail of a partitioned box.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the box have a rectangular shape with a hinged lid that opens upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a stylized treasure chest which opens with a hinged lid, but its shape is not rectangular in the realistic, commercial sense. The design is whimsical rather than literal.",
