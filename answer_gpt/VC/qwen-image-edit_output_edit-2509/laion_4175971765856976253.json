      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the horseshoe-shaped grille with central mesh present on the front of the car and on the robot’s face/torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car features a distinct horseshoe-shaped grille with a mesh pattern at the front, a design element common in sports cars, notably Bugatti. The robot's chest area mirrors this design, with the distinctive horseshoe shape clearly visible, suggesting a transformation aspect where vehicle elements form part of the robot's body. This interpretation uses world knowledge of transforming toys and the recognizable Bugatti grille shape.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the side panels, front bumper, and door sections red, and the roof, hood, and lower body black?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual inspection shows the car having red paint on its side panels, front bumper, and door sections while the roof, hood, and lower body are black. This color scheme aligns with common two-tone sports car designs, emphasizing contrast. The robot, formed from the car, inherits these colors, highlighting the transformation theme.",

      "question": "Do both the car and robot feature five-spoke silver wheels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the car in its vehicle form and the robot include wheels with a five-spoke silver design. Five-spoke wheels are typical in cars, often used for their aesthetic appeal and structural durability. The presence of these wheels on both forms supports the continuity in the transformation design.",

      "question": "Does the robot have gold-colored segmented armor plates on its chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the robot with distinct segmented armor plates on its chest in a gold tone. These segments are identifiable due to their color difference and arrangement, which add to the visual appeal and symbolic nature of armor or layering in robot design. Such design elements are typical in toy robots to emphasize the mechanical nature and robustness.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the robot’s arms formed from the car’s doors and fenders, and its legs from the car’s wheels and undercarriage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, analysis shows that the robot’s arms consist of red door-like panels with wheels resembling fenders, suggesting these parts are the car's doors converted into arm structures. The legs of the robot incorporate wheels and elements resembling the car’s undercarriage, a common transformation mechanism in such toys. This knowledge of transforming toys is applied here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the car positioned in front of the robot, with the robot standing upright behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car is placed at the base, and the robot figure is depicted standing in an upright position behind it. The car is seen directly in front of the robot, indicating a scene that showcases both the vehicle and its transformed state simultaneously, a common way to display transforming toys.",

      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible white stripes on the car's front bumper and side panels, contributing to the vehicle's sporty look. These white accents transition to the robot's shoulders and areas close to its face after transformation, aligning with common designs to maintain visual continuity.",
