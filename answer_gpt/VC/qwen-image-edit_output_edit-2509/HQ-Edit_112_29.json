        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible sails on the ship are colored dark blue. This color indication persists from the typical representation of sails in maritime art or historical ships, and the edited image continues with this color scheme.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship appears to be inside a globe, and its bow is visible with indications of detailing. The notion of intricate carvings and scrollwork suggests ornamental or artistic patterns that are commonly found on historic vessels. This complexity and design are apparent on the bow of the ship in the edited image.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the depiction of the ship within the landscape of a globe presents some limitations in visibility, portholes are identifiable along the side of the hull. These small windows are characteristic of ship design, providing light and air inside, and they do appear on this ship in the edited image.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each of the three masts displays numerous sails. These sails have a square rigging, demonstrating the traditional layout where multiple square sails are positioned vertically along each mast. Such rigging typically enhances maneuverability and speed on tall masted ships.",
