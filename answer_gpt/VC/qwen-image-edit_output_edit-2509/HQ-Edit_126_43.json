    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there at least one clock face with Roman numerals visible on the front or side of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure depicts a mechanical character rather than a traditional clock, and it features notable elements such as a large eye and horn-like protrusions. The structure's face lacks any clock or Roman numerals. Given its design resemblance to a robot or steampunk creation, typical clock elements like Roman numerals are absent. Therefore, the visual analysis of Image B reveals no clock face with Roman numerals.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there transparent glass panels on the lower section of the clock showing internal mechanical components such as pendulums and weights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a character or mechanism with an exposed mechanical area, displaying gears and parts, indicative of a steampunk style. It doesn't possess a traditional clock with glass panels as described. The mechanical section is more of an integrated design element rather than functionally exposed through glass, which suggests the absence of glass panels described in the question.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the base of the structure contain decorative relief carvings featuring circular medallions and floral motifs arranged symmetrically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the structure in Image B, while detailed, matches more with steampunk and fantastical themes. These include technologically inspired decorations, rather than traditional artistic motifs like floral designs or circular medallions symmetrically arranged. The decorative style pertains to gears and mechanical components within a steampunk aesthetic.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a sharpened wooden pencil standing vertically to the right of the clock, with its graphite tip pointing upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no pencil is visible. The structure focuses on the mechanical creature embellishment and does not include any ordinary objects such as a pencil. This contrasts with Image A where a pencil is seen, emphasizing that Image B intentionally does not include this item.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background composed of a light-colored surface with a visible grid pattern of evenly spaced horizontal and vertical lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background presents a similar light color but without a distinct grid pattern composed of horizontal and vertical lines. The focus is placed on the mechanical character, with background patterns that may visually support an artistic tone but lacks any explicit grid pattern as described.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the structure maintain a tall, rectangular, multi-tiered form with symmetrical columns and a defined top cap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a form that adopts a tall, detailed structure reminiscent of mechanical or technological design, with components that echo symmetry and layering typical of steampunk or fantastical creations. While it has vertically stacked elements, it does not strictly conform to the architectural symmetry of columns and caps typical of traditional structural designs, as seen in clocks.",
