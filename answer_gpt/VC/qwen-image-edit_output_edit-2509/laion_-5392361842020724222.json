      ],

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of standing on rocky bases, Mary and Joseph are depicted standing on a flat marble-like surface, in keeping with the more stylized and ornate representation typical of a painting rather than a physical sculpture.",
