      "question": "Are the silver blades still visibly reflective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silver blades have been edited with an illustrative effect, which might reduce the perception of reflectivity that shiny metal typically has. However, the lines and highlights suggest a sense of metal shine, giving an impression of reflectivity. Reflective surfaces often have bright spots and reflections, which are suggested by these lines.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the golden handles still show a polished finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden handles in Image B have a drawn effect applied, but the highlighting suggests they are meant to appear polished. Polished surfaces generally have bright highlights and smooth curves, both of which are illustrated in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the open V-shape configuration of the blades preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scissors are depicted in an open V-shape, indicating that this aspect of the configuration was preserved from Image A. The position of the scissor blades clearly forms a V-shape, a typical configuration of scissors when open.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background still a uniform dark gray?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to have a uniform dark gray color, maintaining the consistency seen in Image A. Although the editing added some texture to the scissors, the background color remains a similar uniform dark gray shade.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the edges of the blades still clean and sharp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, with its drawn overlay, maintains the depiction of sharp, clean edges typical of scissor blades. The illustration emphasizes the contours and edges, which are necessary features for the blades to be perceived as sharp.",
