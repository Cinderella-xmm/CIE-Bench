      "question": "Is the central flower beneath the butterfly a pink coneflower with a prominent spiky central cone and drooping pink petals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central flower beneath the butterfly does not resemble a traditional pink coneflower. Instead, this flower features an intricate arrangement of colorful petals that form the shape of a butterfly's wings. The focus is on the artistic depiction of petals rather than a literal spiky central cone and drooping petals seen in typical pink coneflowers. Image A represents a more realistic depiction of a pink coneflower, which is absent in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the butterfly positioned directly above the central cone of the flower, with its body aligned vertically over it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, what might appear like a butterfly is actually a creative composition made from the flower's petals themselves. There is no traditional butterfly perched on a flower. Hence, there can be no alignment above a central cone since there is no actual butterfly. Image A shows a butterfly directly above the flower's central cone, contrasting with this creative depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there tall golden grasses and additional pink coneflowers visible in the background behind the main flower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a soft background with floral elements similar to golden grasses and pink blooms, maintaining the gentle meadow scenery found in Image A. Given these elements persist in the background of Image B, it is accurate to assert their presence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sky a pale blue with soft white clouds and a warm golden light illuminating the meadow from below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky maintains a pale blue tone with subtle white clouds akin to the preceding image. The scene still features warm lighting emanating from below, enhancing the overall ambiance. This lighting contributes to the meadow's illumination, matching Image A in terms of atmospheric quality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small clusters of purple wildflowers and pink spiky blooms visible among the grasses in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B's background, there are floral clusters that resemble wildflowers interspersed amid the grass, maintaining a similar composition to the original. These background features persist visually in Image B, suggesting their presence among the grasses.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the central cone of the flower have a spiky, bristly texture made of densely packed dark-tipped florets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central cone of the flower does not possess a spiky, bristly texture. The flower features an artistic design with colorful petals forming the wings and antennae of a butterfly, overshadowing any actual spiky cone formation present in Image A. Thus, the absence of such detail leads to a negative response.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the petals of the central flower curve downward and have a smooth, elongated shape with a soft pink hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows petals as part of an elaborate artistic composition of the butterfly-like flower, rather than the realistic smooth, elongated pink petals of a coneflower in Image A. The petals here are vibrant and multi-colored, contributing to the butterfly's structure. Thus, it offers a stylized approach contrary to real drooping petal forms.",
