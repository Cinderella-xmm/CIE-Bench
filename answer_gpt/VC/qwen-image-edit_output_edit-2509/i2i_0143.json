      "question": "Is the \"PARKING\" label clearly visible on the parking meter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 'PARKING' label is prominently displayed at the top of the parking meter in Image B. This can be seen due to the distinct lettering and contrast between the text and the background. The design is typical of parking meters, where critical information is placed at eye level, making it easily readable. Thus, the label is clearly visible.",

      "question": "Does the sticker on the parking meter display the text \"ComsiAcara\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'ComsiAcara' is visible on the central sticker of the parking meter. The alignment and visibility of this text are clear and distinct due to its placement and the font used, as parking meter labels usually ensure clarity for users to read important information and instructions.",

      "question": "Is the parking meter securely attached and standing upright on a pole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The parking meter is shown as securely attached to a pole, standing upright. This can be deduced from the straight, vertical alignment of the meter and its typical positioning, which ensures stability and resistance to external conditions.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the parking meter retain its original size and structural proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The parking meter in Image B maintains natural structural proportions comparable to a standard parking meter based on common design traits like height and width relative to its components. The meter's shape and dimensions appear consistent with common designs observed in urban environments, indicating it retains its original proportions.",

      "question": "Is the shadow of the parking meter visible on the ground beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Contrary to what one might expect from a tall object like a parking meter, which typically casts a shadow when illuminated by a light source, in Image B, there's no visible shadow on the ground. This could be due to either the absence of a distinguishable shadow in the image or the lighting conditions or angle that prevents a clear shadow from being seen.",
