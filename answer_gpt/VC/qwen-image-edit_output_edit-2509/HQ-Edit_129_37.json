    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the cardinal direction labels N, E, S, and W clearly visible and correctly positioned on the embossed compass face of the perfume bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On Image B, analyzing the object that resembles a compass face on the perfume bottle, the typical compass rose with cardinal direction labels should include the letters 'N,' 'E,' 'S,' and 'W,' representing North, East, South, and West, respectively. Upon inspection, the embossing does not clearly feature these letters in their traditional positions, which are usually prominently displayed for easy navigation purposes. Hence, they are not visible or correctly positioned on the design of Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the full 360-degree scale with numerical markings (e.g., 0, 90, 180, 270) present and evenly spaced around the outer edge of the embossed compass face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The perfume bottle in Image B resembles a compass, and one would expect a 360-degree scale commonly marked on such items for navigational purposes. However, examining the outer edge of the embossed design, there are no visible numerical markings around the full circumference of the object to indicate degrees or directionality. Such features are absent in Image B.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the embossed compass face retain the original eight-pointed star-like radial pattern with symmetrical arms extending from the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central design element on the perfume bottle does feature a pattern resembling an eight-pointed star. This is a characteristic design used for compass roses, with symmetrical arms extending from the center to signify direction. The retention of this pattern suggests continuity in design from the concept of a navigational compass.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the body of the perfume bottle perfectly circular in shape, matching the original compass’s outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the perfume bottle is visually circular and matches the overall outline shape of the original compass depicted in Image A. This consistency in shape highlights the attempt to mirror the appearance of the compass in the design of the fragrance bottle.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the cap of the perfume bottle feature engraved cartographic details such as a compass rose and intersecting grid lines, matching those seen on the map fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cap of the perfume bottle displays an engraved design but does not directly mimic detailed cartographic elements typically seen on maps, such as compass roses or intersecting grid lines. It rather depicts a more generalized artistic pattern, unlike the specific and intricate cartographic symbols found on the torn map pieces.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a small central raised dot or hub at the exact center of the embossed compass face, corresponding to the original needle pivot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the embossed design on Image B, the perfume bottle, a central stylized element replaces the traditional hub or pivot seen in typical compass designs where a needle would rotate. This suggests the absence of such a small raised dot specifically serving the function or visual role of a pivot.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the outer ring of the embossed compass face clearly delineated with fine engravings and consistent spacing between degree marks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an aggressively stylized design, and the outer ring of the compass face does not possess fine engravings or evenly spaced degree marks. This departs from the intricate navigational features expected in a traditional compass, indicating that such fine detailing is not present.",
