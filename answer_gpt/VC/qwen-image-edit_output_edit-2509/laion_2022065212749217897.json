      "question": "Are the eyes almond-shaped with a grayish-blue iris and visible upper and lower eyelashes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) presents a cartoonish keychain depiction. Given the artistic and simplified nature of chibi-style illustrations, details like iris color and eyelashes are usually not shown in such art forms. Therefore, it's unlikely for the chibi image to feature almond-shaped eyes with specific details such as a grayish-blue iris or eyelashes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a receding hairline with thin, light gray hair present only on the sides and back of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction has a simplified, straightforward design typical of chibi-style illustrations. The hair is represented in a cartoon-like style with clear balding on top. The sides show a minimal amount of gray hair, consistent with this artistic style's interpretation of a balding appearance.",

      "question": "Does the shirt have thin vertical red and white stripes running along the collar and down the placket on a dark blue background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the shirt is illustrated with broad, multi-colored stripes. Each stripe is distinctly different from the pattern in Image A, which features thin vertical stripes of red and white. Hence, the description doesn't match the edited image's portrayal.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible white button at the top of the shirtâ€™s placket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style depiction in Image B tends to simplify clothing details. Examining the edited image reveals no visible buttons on the cartoon shirt, as the art style may omit such intricate elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style illustration in Image B simplifies clothing designs, and there appears to be no depiction of a blazer in the overall look. Therefore, the blazer and its notched lapel are not represented in this cartoon illustration.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are fine lines visible around the eyes and forehead, and is the skin texture subtly detailed with pores?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi illustrations, as seen in Image B, are characterized by their simplicity and lack of realistic details. They typically don't incorporate detailed features like fine lines or skin textures due to their stylized nature. The skin in Image B appears smooth and is devoid of any detailed texture.",
