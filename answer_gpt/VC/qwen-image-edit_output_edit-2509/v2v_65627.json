      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the figure is clearly an elephant built from blocks, which can be inferred from its distinctive features. The elephant has large, wide ears and a trunk, which are both classic identifiers for an elephant. This is consistent with common characteristics associated with elephants, maintained even in a block or LEGO-like form.",

      "question": "Is the hat placed on top of the elephant's head and the collar around its neck in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the elephant is depicted wearing a yellow hat on top of its head. This is accomplished with a few yellow blocks positioned directly above the elephant's head. Additionally, a red and yellow collar is depicted around the elephant's neck, which is represented by a series of blocks encircling the base of the head. These elements are consistent with the depiction of accessories commonly seen in elephant representations dressed in circus attire.",

      "question": "Are the eyes of the elephant black in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's eyes are constructed with blocks that represent large, black pupils with white highlights, which is a common stylistic choice for creating expressive and recognizable eyes, especially in animated or stylized figures.",

      "question": "Is the elephant facing forward in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The orientation of the elephant in Image B shows it facing the viewer directly, as evidenced by the symmetry in the placement of facial features such as the eyes, trunk, and ears. This forward-facing stance is typical for showcasing the character's design fully and is a conventional pose in character art to convey that the subject is engaging the audience.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A (original) and Image B (edited), both depict the same block-style model of an elephant. The fundamental structure, comprised of the same block elements in similar arrangements, persists between both images. While the background in Image B has changed to a stage setting, the elephant itself remains constructed from the same type of blocks with identical shapes and configuration, reflecting a consistent adherence to the original model's form.",
