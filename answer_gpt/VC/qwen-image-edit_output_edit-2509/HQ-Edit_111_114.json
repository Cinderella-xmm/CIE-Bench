      "question": "Is the man wearing a wide-brimmed straw hat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is depicted sitting on a scooter, wearing a hat that has a wide brim. This type of hat is typically associated with straw hats, providing shade from the sun. The visual cues such as the texture and color further suggest it is a straw material.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the man have a full white beard and mustache?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area where a beard and mustache would be is blurred along with part of the face. However, without relying on Image A, there is no clear visual evidence in Image B to suggest the presence of a full white beard or mustache.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scooter shows a distinct circular shape at its front, which is characteristic of a headlight. This feature is common in vintage scooters.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a structure below the circular headlight of the scooter that appears to be a grille with a chrome finish. This is a common stylistic feature on vintage scooters.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scooter's front does not display a metal luggage rack; instead, space is taken up by the headlight and grille without additional racks visible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, only the front wheel of the scooter is clearly visible, showing a tire with a spoke pattern. The second rear wheel is not distinctly visible in the image, making it impossible to confirm its features purely based on Image B alone.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the man seated on the scooter with both legs extended forward over the footrest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is seated on the scooter, and his legs are bent, with one leg on the ground and the other potentially placed on a footrest, but not extended forward over the footrest.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a ground pattern that consists of cobblestones. The pattern in the image appears to be quite regular and organized, possibly aligned in a herringbone pattern, which creates a visually distinct geometric arrangement.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features buildings with multiple arched doorways. However, the shutters visible near these doorways are not green; they are the typical color of plain wooden shutters. Therefore, describing them as green is not accurate based on the visual elements of the edited image.",
