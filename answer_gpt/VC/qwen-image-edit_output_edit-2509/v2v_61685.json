      "question": "Is the girl depicted in a posture that suggests she is interacting with the skateboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl's posture includes having one of her feet on the skateboard, which is a typical indication of interacting with or preparing to ride the skateboard. This positioning suggests engagement with the skateboard. Through visual observation and common skateboarding posture recognition, this interaction is identifiable.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the man depicted in a posture that suggests he is interacting with the skateboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's posture is more relaxed, with hands behind his back and standing beside the skateboard. This does not suggest direct interaction with the skateboard, as he seems to be conversing or observing rather than actively using or adjusting the skateboard.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the girl and the man positioned next to each other, leaning against the railing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the girl and the man are depicted standing adjacent to each other, with visual cues suggesting they are positioned next to the railing. However, neither appears to be leaning against it; their posture is more aligned with standing upright without direct leaning.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both skateboards visible in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a skateboard is clearly visible in front of the girl, but the second skateboard's presence in the image is not direct, as the depiction focuses primarily on one. Given typical visual representation practices, when an object such as a skateboard is omitted, it is often not visually emphasized.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tent is depicted in the background with a shape and positioning similar to Image A. The essential triangular features and location relative to the figures are consistent, demonstrating the preservation of its general form.",
