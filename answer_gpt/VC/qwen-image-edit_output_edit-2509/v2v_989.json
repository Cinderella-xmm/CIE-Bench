      "question": "Is the dog depicted with a black coat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is visually represented with a monochromatic black coat. The simplicity and color choice in the illustration clearly indicate that the dog's coat is black. This observation aligns with common representations of objects in illustrations, where black coloring is used to represent a black object.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dog shown in a relaxed, lying-down posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is visually illustrated in a position typical of relaxation, lying on the ground with its body sprawled out and its head resting on the paws. This posture is generally associated with a relaxed state in dogs, as they often lie down this way when at ease.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the bench depicted in green?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bench is illustrated using black lines and shading without any hint of color fill. In cartoons or simplified drawings, often benches are shown in black or shades rather than specific colors like green. This indicates that the bench is not explicitly depicted in green in this illustration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the dog positioned next to the bench?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is shown lying on the ground directly beside the bench. Its body is parallel and in close proximity to the bench's edge, indicating positioning next to the bench, based on typical interpretations of spatial arrangements in illustrations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the radio, juice box, and trash bag present on the bench?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the radio, juice box, and trash bag are visually depicted positioned on the bench in a clear, simplistic illustration. Their presence here mimics a straightforward arrangement often seen in illustrations to show objects placed on surfaces. All three items are distinctly present and identifiable on the bench.",
