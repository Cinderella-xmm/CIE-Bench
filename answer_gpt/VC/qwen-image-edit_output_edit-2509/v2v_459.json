      "question": "Does the left tie retain its diagonal striped pattern in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left tie still exhibits a diagonal striped pattern with multiple colors. The visual consistency of the stripes indicates that the pattern remains the same. Common knowledge about ties and patterns helps validate that this consistent appearance retains its design pattern.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the right tie retain its white polka dot pattern in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right tie displays a polka dot pattern with white dots on a blue background. This pattern matches common polka dot designs, suggesting that the original pattern is still present. My analysis relies on observing the repeating circular shapes consistent with common polka dot designs.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the original colors (red, orange, turquoise, blue for the left tie and blue with white dots for the right tie) retained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left tie has stripes of red, orange, turquoise, and blue, while the right tie retains a blue background with white dots. The colors are prominently visible and match the expected colors of both ties. By comparing the visible colors in both images and applying knowledge of color consistency, it's clear the colors are retained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the ties arranged next to each other in the edited image, maintaining their relative positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ties are positioned side by side, with the striped tie on the left and the polka dot tie on the right. This arrangement mirrors their positioning in Image A. By comparing their positions in both images and understanding spatial arrangements, it's evident that the relative positioning is maintained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a realistic surface texture in the background of the edited image, even if it is not the original wooden texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a smooth wooden drawer texture with a knob and neatly crafted lines, offering a realistic appearance. Even though this texture differs from the wooden surface of Image A, it still provides a sense of realism, which reflects an understanding of surface textures in real-world contexts.",
