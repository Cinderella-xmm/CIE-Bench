    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the owl's face clearly depicted with two large, dark, round eyes and a distinct facial disc?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the section where the owl's face would typically be is blurred, making it impossible to determine the depiction of the owl's facial features, such as its eyes and facial disc. Therefore, although world knowledge tells us that owls generally have such features, this specific visual cue is obscured.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the horizontal bars on the owlâ€™s chest and the white spots on its wings visibly present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the blurred section, the rest of the owl's body is visible. The characteristic horizontal bars on the chest and white spots on its wings are clearly depicted, typical of an owl's plumage, allowing us to affirm their presence.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the owl positioned facing forward with its head slightly turned toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the portrayal of the owl suggests that it is facing forward, and although the face is blurred, the body orientation and posture imply a slightly forward-facing and slightly turned head, which is typical owl behavior when observing something.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the tree branch display a deeply ridged and layered bark texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree branch on which the owl is perched exhibits clearly visible ridged and layered bark texture. This detail enhances the realism of the tree, giving it a rough, natural appearance typical of a large tree branch, like one an owl might choose for perching.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the moon located directly behind the owl, centered in the upper portion of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moon is positioned directly behind the owl, creating a luminous halo effect around its silhouette. This placement centers the moon in the upper section of the image, aligning with the owl itself, which is a common artistic technique to frame the subject.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there leafy branches visible in the upper corners of the image, forming a partial canopy around the owl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, leafy branches extend into the frame from the upper corners, partially surrounding the owl. This creates a canopy-like effect, providing a naturalistic setting typical for owls, which often dwell in wooded environments.",
