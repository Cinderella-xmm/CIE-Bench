      "question": "Are the eyes blue and positioned symmetrically in the face, looking directly forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the face has been blurred, making it impossible to determine the color or positioning of the eyes. Without visible eyes, one cannot ascertain their color or symmetrical alignment.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image blurs the facial features, including the nose. With the face obscured, it's not possible to verify the size, shape, or central positioning of the nose.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial region of the edited image is blurred, so it's impossible to evaluate the state of the mouth, such as whether it is closed or the lip shape.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the shirt appears to be shining with a metallic or pearl-like finish, making it not purely white but rather having reflective qualities.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given the blurred face in the edited image, the skin tone of the face cannot be assessed. However, the visible neck area shows a fair and consistent skin tone. The face cannot be commented on due to the blur.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blur effect on the face in the edited image prevents the observer from evaluating the symmetry of facial features along the vertical midline.",
