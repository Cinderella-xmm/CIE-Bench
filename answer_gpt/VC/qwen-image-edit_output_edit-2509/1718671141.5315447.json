      "question": "Is there a raised platform beneath the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the building is clearly situated on a platform, as evidenced by the stairs leading up to the entrance, which are visible in the image. This indicates that the base of the building is elevated above the surrounding ground level, thus forming a raised platform. This setup is typical for structures designed to have a formal entrance marked with steps.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a still water surface directly in front of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the reflection of the building in water is visible. This implies that there is indeed water directly in front of the building, which is still enough to produce a clear reflection. The presence of such a feature is typical in landscaping for aesthetics and often used to enhance the visual impact of architecture.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the building have multiple horizontal tiers stacked vertically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the building does not appear to have horizontal tiers stacked vertically. Instead, the structure is heavily characterized by gears and clocks in a steampunk style without the distinct flat levels seen in tiered buildings. This design choice differentiates the building from tiered architecture, focusing instead on circular and complex machinery aesthetics.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the building positioned centrally above the water pool on a raised platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the building is symmetrically placed atop a raised platform in the middle of a still water pool. Its symmetry and central positioning can be discerned from the alignment of its reflection in the water, indicating an intentional architectural design meant for visual balance and aesthetic appeal, a common practice in site planning.",

      "question": "Is the sky dark blue with scattered stars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a sky notably characterized by its dark blue color and scattered stars, indicative of a nighttime setting. This is a common scene-setting in images for creating dramatic visual backgrounds, enhancing the ambiance of night against structures.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there trees arranged symmetrically on both sides of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, trees are observed on both sides of the building. They are positioned in a way that seems symmetrical, complementing the central alignment of the building and contributing to the visual balance of the overall scene. Such symmetry is a common element in architectural landscaping to create harmony and focus.",
