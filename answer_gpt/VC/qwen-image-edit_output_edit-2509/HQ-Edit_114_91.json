      "question": "Is the anvil’s pointed horn still present and positioned at the same end of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object replacing the anvil is a tree stump with carved runes. The original anvil from Image A is not present, and its features, such as the pointed horn, do not appear in the edited image. The alteration marks a significant change in the structure of the object, indicating that it is no longer an anvil but has transformed into a different item.",

      "question": "Does the hammer retain a wooden handle connected to its head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer is replaced by a tree stump, and there is no wooden handle or hammer head visible as in Image A. The object in the edited image now resembles a tree stump with runes, which does not include the characteristics of a hammer.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hammer resting diagonally across the anvil’s flat surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no hammer present in Image B as it has been replaced by a tree stump with glowing runes. Also, the surface in Image B no longer resembles the flat surface of an anvil. Therefore, the position and presence of the hammer as seen in Image A do not exist in the edited image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, a multi-paned window with frosted glass is clearly visible on the left side. The window appears unchanged in the transition from Image A to Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B depict a range of metal tools mounted on a greenish-gray wooden wall. The vertical arrangement of tools remains consistent between both images, retaining the backdrop feature.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are green ivy leaves visible growing over the window frame and wrapping around the base of the anvil and hammer handle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the anvil and hammer have been replaced, green ivy leaves are still visible growing over the window frame and adjacent surfaces. However, they do not wrap around the base of any hammer handle or anvil, as these objects have been replaced by a tree stump.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a tree stump instead of an anvil, although the wooden workbench remains in place. However, the texture and appearance of the workbench do show signs of being altered into a more organic form, with no apparent dust accumulation visible like in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there visible roots and organic debris scattered on the surface of the workbench?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the workbench is adorned with roots and organic features. These organic additions are clearly visible on the surface of the workbench, marking the transformation from a dusty tool environment in Image A to a more natural setting.",
