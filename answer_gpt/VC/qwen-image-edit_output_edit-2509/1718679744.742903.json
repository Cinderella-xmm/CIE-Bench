      "question": "Is the crocodile's snout with two visible teeth present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the crocodile's snout is still distinctly visible with its shape and texture well-defined, including visible teeth. The depiction of the teeth in cartoon-style lines suggests a playful, stylized version of the original concept, maintaining the essence of the crocodile but in a pop art style.",

      "question": "Is the colorful knitted hat with a red pom-pom still present on the crocodile's head in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a colorful hat on the crocodile's head similar to the original. The hat is characterized by bold, bright colors and patterns typical of pop art style but mimics the original knitted texture visually. The presence of the red pom-pom at the top remains a consistent element between both images.",

      "question": "Are the orange-framed sunglasses with reflective lenses still positioned over the crocodile's eyes in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the sunglasses are vibrant and match the playful, bright color scheme typical of pop art. The shape and color of the sunglasses, including an abstract representation of reflective lenses, are consistent with how they were positioned in the original image, reinforcing the signature look carried over from Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the crocodile's head oriented forward with a slight leftward turn in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head orientation of the crocodile suggests a similar position to Image A, where it appears facing forward with a slight angle to the left. The angle and positioning of facial features are consistent, maintaining the same expressive, engaging posture.",

      "question": "Is the crocodile partially submerged in water in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the depiction transforms the scene into a stylized, vibrant cartoon or pop art composition. The presence of water around the crocodile as seen in the original image is abstracted into this new style, indicating through colorful lines and dots rather than realistic representations. Thus, it doesn't convey the impression of being submerged in water.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there reflections visible in the lenses of the sunglasses in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lenses in Image B, while maintaining a bright, reflective color scheme synonymous with their portrayal in pop art style, do not explicitly convey any detailed reflections as seen in Image A. Instead, the emphasis is on the vibrant colors and shapes.",
