      "question": "Is the figureâ€™s skin uniformly colored in a vivid blue tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skin of the figure is consistently in a vivid blue, akin to a painted or digitally manipulated artistic depiction. The color is uniform and covers the entire visible body areas, including the shoulders, neck, and hand. This suggests an intentional stylistic effect rather than a real-world depiction.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the banana rendered in a metallic gold color with a curved, elongated shape resembling a real banana?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the banana maintains a shape that replicates the natural curvature and elongation typical of a real banana. It is styled in a metallic gold color, giving it an artistic appearance that is distinct from the typical yellow of a banana.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, ears) clearly visible and anatomically recognizable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face is obscured, with no visible facial features, which do not allow for anatomical recognition. The absence of eyes, nose, and mouth indicates a focus away from specific human identity in the image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the hand visible and positioned near the banana, suggesting a prior or ongoing interaction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a blue-colored hand is clearly visible and holds the banana in a position that suggests interaction, consistent with a typical posture for holding or presenting an object.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the figure shown in a side profile with the head turned slightly forward, facing right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's head is portrayed in a side profile position, facing right, as indicated by the alignment of the head and ear. This positioning suggests a focus or interaction directed towards the banana.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a background behind the figure, even if it is transformed or warped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a swirl of blue and gold artistic patterns. It creates an illusion of depth and texture, showing that there is indeed a background, transformed into an artistic representation.",
