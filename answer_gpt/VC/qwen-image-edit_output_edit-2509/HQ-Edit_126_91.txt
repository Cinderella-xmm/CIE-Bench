    "Question": "Q4: Is the floor composed of large square tiles arranged in a repeating pattern of alternating dark and light shades?",
    "Explanation": "In Image B, the floor is composed of large tiles, but these tiles do not exhibit a pattern of alternating dark and light shades. Instead, the tiles have a uniform look, primarily in light shades, affirming a simple tile design.
