    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the emerald-green gemstones present in the same oval-cut shape and vibrant green color as in the original necklace?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible necklace to assess the shape and color of emerald-green gemstones. Instead, a curved lime-green tail is the focal point. Therefore, there's no basis for evaluating emerald gemstones in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the necklace made of metal with a darkened, oxidized silver finish, showing visible contrast in the engraved details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a necklace but instead shows a glass dome with a chandelier and green scenery inside. Hence, there is no observable metal necklace to evaluate in terms of an oxidized silver finish.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the necklace retain the complex symmetrical scrollwork and decorative floral patterns throughout its structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no necklace present in Image B for analysis; the content inside the dome focuses on other elements such as the chandelier and snake tail. As such, there can't be an analysis of scrollwork or patterns from a necklace.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the snake tail still present with its original lime-green color, visible scales, and curved form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the snake tail is indeed visible, exhibiting a lime-green color with noticeable scales and a curved form. This indicates consistency with the features described.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the small white gemstones still present in their original positions around the larger emerald stones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no gemstones visible as there is no necklace present. The visual content focuses on a dome with different elements, so there are no small white gemstones to observe.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the snake tail maintain its original curved path wrapping around the left side of the mannequin's neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no mannequin or necklace for a snake tail to wrap around. The tail is positioned within the glass dome setup, detached from any mannequin context.",
      "weight": 2,
