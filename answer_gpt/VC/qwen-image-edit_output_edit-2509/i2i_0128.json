      "question": "Are the hands still visibly interacting with and pressing the keys on the keyboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues indicate the hands are positioned over the keyboard in a manner that suggests interaction with the keys. The fingers appear to be in a typing posture, pressing down on the keys. This suggests that despite any added effects, the hands continue to be depicted engaging with the keyboard.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the keyboard retain its original physical layout and key structure despite the added neon effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keyboard's layout, including the arrangement of the keys and the spacing between them, appears unchanged despite the introduction of neon effects. The effects are overlays that do not alter the fundamental structure or layout of the keyboard. By comparing with common keyboard aesthetics, one can infer that the underlying physical attributes of the keys remain intact.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the laptop's overall body shape and placement relative to the hands consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the shape and angle of the laptop body appear consistent with its depiction in Image A. The hands' placement in relation to the keyboard suggests that the laptop's orientation and structure have not been fundamentally altered. Visual cues such as the laptop's side view and the visible portions of the keyboard support this consistency.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the hands retain their general posture and positioning relative to the keyboard as seen in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands are positioned over the keyboard in a manner similar to Image A, suggesting they maintain the same typing posture. The positioning of the fingers and wrists relative to the keys indicates that there has been no significant change in how the hands are interacting with the keyboard.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image retain realistic textures for the keyboard and the surface under the hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B incorporates neon effects which alter the visual appearance of the keyboard and surface, reducing their realistic texture. The bright neon glow modifies the texture perception, making them appear less realistic compared to the subdued, natural tones and reflections in Image A.",
