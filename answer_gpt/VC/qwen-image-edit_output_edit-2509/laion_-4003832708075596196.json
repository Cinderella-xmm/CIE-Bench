    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are all leaf-shaped elements in the image, including those used as heads, clearly five-pointed maple leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree's leaves and the heads have a distinct maple leaf shape with multiple points, which is typical of maple leaves having around 5 major points, although the leaf-shaped heads may not be purely five-pointed. Therefore, the combination of world knowledge about maple leaf structures and an observation of visual cues suggests that not all leaf-shaped elements, particularly those being used as heads, are strictly five-pointed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are all leaf elements rendered exclusively in shades of orange, yellow, and red?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leaf elements in Image B include variations of orange, yellow, and red shades typically seen in autumn foliage, suggesting adherence to a common fall color palette and coinciding with world knowledge of seasonal visuals. Thus, all leaf elements appear to fit within these exclusive shades.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a solid brown rectangular border surrounding the central illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a clear, solid brown rectangular border around the illustration of the tree, which can be identified through both the color and the continuous line nature of the border. Comparison with world knowledge about typical card frames can confirm this observation.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background of the card uniformly white?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spaces beyond the tree and leaf illustrations in Image B are white and consistent, which is standard for highlighting artwork centrally in card designs. Given the uniformity and lack of additional color or texture, the background is uniformly white.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the central illustration positioned centrally within the card, bounded by the rectangular frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree and leaf illustration are visually central within the rectangular frame, maintaining equal space on each side and at the top and bottom. This positioning is typical for card design to emphasize the illustration as a focal point, indicating proper central placement within the card.",
