      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration on the calendar shows the lifter gripping a barbell rod with both hands in front of his body, not across his upper back, as seen in traditional deadlift positions. The absence of a depiction of the barbell across the upper back makes the statement untrue.",
