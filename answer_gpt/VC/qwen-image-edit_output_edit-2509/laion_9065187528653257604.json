      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycles feature futuristic design elements with glowing neon lights, indicating they are representations or models rather than real vehicles.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycles have a distinct futuristic style with glowing elements that obscure some traditional motorcycle features. Despite the creative fantasy aspect, the structure of the mock engine can still suggest a V-shape arrangement, as this is a common design in motorcycles and can be inferred from the visible structure.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows motorcycles with a futuristic design theme including glowing elements. Although the exhaust pipes are present, they do not appear to be traditional chrome in the glowing representation, and they do not distinctly run along the right side in a visible manner as in traditional motorcycles.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, though containing futuristic elements, depicts motorcycles that retain certain real-world characteristics, such as a white and smooth fuel tank with rounded contours. This can be identified from the overall shape and design despite the enhanced glowing and futuristic aesthetic overlay.",
