      "question": "Does the robot still have two distinct upward-pointing antennae on its head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a robot inside a glass dome with two distinct upward-pointing antennae on its head, similar to Image A, indicating that this detail has been maintained. Antennae are often used in mecha designs for communication or as stylistic features, and the same is applied here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a blue-tinted visor visible on the robot’s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's face does not show any blue-tinted visor. Instead, it features a metallic headpiece without any distinct visor coloration, unlike some robotic designs that incorporate visors for aesthetic or functional purposes.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there red glowing elements present on the robot’s chest and eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any red glowing elements on the robot's chest or eyes. The lighting and reflections seem neutral, indicating an absence of any glowing effects usually used in robots for highlighting power sources or activation status.",

      "question": "Are the segmented armor plates with visible panel lines and rivets still present on the robot’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot in Image B retains its detailed segmented armor plates with visible panel lines and rivets, reflecting typical designs in robotic structuring for mobility and detailing, similar to the original image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature any distant city skyline with tall towers or construction cranes. Instead, it shows a simple miniature landscape inside the glass dome, focusing on the robot without background structures, unlike Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there small green trees present in the foreground and midground of the miniature landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes small green trees in both the foreground and midground of the miniature landscape inside the dome, which helps give a sense of scale and environment for the robot model.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible dust cloud beneath the robot's right foot. The miniature setting does not replicate dust effects, which are more typical of a dynamic, outdoor scene as depicted in Image A.",
