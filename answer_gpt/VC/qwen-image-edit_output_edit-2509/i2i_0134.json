      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which appears to depict a miniature tree in a forest setting, there are no visual indications of steam rising from the tree. Steam is typically visible as misty or smoky trails, mainly noticeable in environments where heat is applied, like in cooking. The outdoor scene does not imply any heat source that would generate steam from the tree. Therefore, considering these visual cues and logic, the answer is No.",

      "question": "Does the broccoli/tree rest on a white plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the tree planted in a natural forest floor setting rather than on a plate. The forest floor is depicted with earthy tones and is filled with moss and leaves, which are typical for such environments. A white plate would be easily identifiable due to its distinct, typically circular shape and color, different from the natural ground. Thus, combining visual information and situational knowledge, the tree does not rest on a white plate. The answer is No.",

      "question": "Is the broccoli/tree primarily green in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a miniature tree which is predominantly green, characteristic of healthy foliage in a natural environment. The green leaves are prominent, especially with the sunlight highlighting them. This aligns with common knowledge that trees have green leaves due to chlorophyll. Therefore, the green color is a noticeable characteristic of the tree. Hence, the answer is Yes.",

      "question": "Are the characteristic florets of the broccoli discernible on the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object depicted is a tree with leaves and branches, typical features in a forest setting. Broccoli florets are small cluster-like structures on vegetable stalks, which are quite different from the leaf and branch structure of the tree. The tree lacks the dense, compact clusters typical of broccoli florets. Considering botanical characteristics, the answer is No.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a tree which certainly has a stem or trunk structure that supports its leaves and branches â€” which is common in trees. This trunk is distinct from the cluster of leaves, acting as the main support structure, similar to how broccoli has a central stem supporting its florets. Thus, by examining the tree, it does have a defined stem-like structure. The answer is Yes.",
