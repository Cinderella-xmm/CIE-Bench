      "question": "Is the Nikon branding visible and legible in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Nikon' is clearly visible on the top of the camera body, just as in Image A. The font is similar to the original and immediately recognizable due to its placement and styling, which is consistent with the standard branding associated with Nikon cameras. This legibility allows for easy identification.",

      "question": "Is the lens positioned centrally on the camera body in the steampunk illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lens is shown as centered on the camera body, akin to a traditional camera design. This central placement is standard for camera designs for balance and functionality, and the illustration maintains this functional design choice. The visual cues of symmetry about the central vertical axis of the camera ensure this understanding.",

      "question": "Is the tripod still visibly connected to the camera through a central mount?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the steampunk illustration (Image B), the tripod visibly connects to the camera through a central mounting platform. This can be deduced through the rendition of the tripod's legs and the base of the camera being connected. The design maintains the structural integrity necessary for a stable connection, which is common in tripod setups for cameras.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the relative proportions of the camera body, lens, and tripod maintained in the steampunk rendition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration maintains recognizable proportions for the camera body, lens, and tripod, similar to Image A. The camera body occupies a significant portion of the frame with the lens being proportionately smaller, and the tripod underneath supporting the structure. These dimensions are visually consistent between both images, ensuring the portrayal remains true to a realistic camera setup.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the illustration retain a clear depiction of metallic textures on the camera and tripod?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the camera and tripod with explicit metallic textures, characterized by gears, rivets, and a shiny, reflective appearance indicating metallic surfaces. The steampunk style is associated with industrial and metallic elements, reflecting a visual consistency with real-life metallic materials through the depiction of these textural elements.",
