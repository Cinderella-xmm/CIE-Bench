      "question": "Are the two cars in the image identifiable as the same models shown in the original, with the same body shapes and design features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cars appear to be of the same make as in Image A, featuring similar back lights, body shapes, and design elements. The rear view mirrors, tail lights, and overall contours align with those observed in Image A. Although the plate numbers differ, possibly for artistic effect, the visual cues suggest that both cars are the same models as seen in the original image.",

    {

      "question": "Are the red traffic lights still visible above the cars, maintaining their original function as stop signals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red traffic lights are clearly visible above the cars and continue to serve their original function as stop signals. The presence of multiple red lights in the frame is consistent with their role in controlling traffic flow, just as they appear in Image A.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the lane markings on the road clearly visible and consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the lane markings on the road are less visible compared to Image A. The darker ambiance and lighting make them harder to discern, which may impede their utility for guiding vehicles. Therefore, the clarity and visibility of the lane markings differ from the original image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the urban environment, such as trees and roadside elements, remains intact, maintaining the continuity of the scene. The darkened ambiance and color shift do alter the imagery, but the core elements, including the silhouette of the trees, are preserved, just like in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of both cars on the road mirrors that of Image A. They are aligned parallel to each other, suggesting they are stopped at the traffic signal, consistent with their original arrangement. The perspective and spacing remain unchanged.",
