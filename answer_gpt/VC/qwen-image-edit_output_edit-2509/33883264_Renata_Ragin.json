      "question": "Are the pointed Gothic arches clearly visible within the stone towers of the bridge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone towers of the Brooklyn Bridge are present, however, they are not the primary focus in the image as they are overshadowed by the large statue dominating the scene. Nonetheless, the bridge itself is correctly depicted with its characteristic stone structures. Given the editing and the attention diverted to the giant statue, the arches are not prominently visible or focused upon. Image A contains the original bridge structure with typical pointed Gothic arches visible, suggesting a difference in depiction.",

      "question": "Is the American flag still present on top of the left tower of the bridge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus has shifted significantly due to the oversized statue, and the area where the American flag is typically found on the Brooklyn Bridge tower is obscured by the statue. If present, the flag would be lost against the background due to the nature of the edit. In Image A, the American flag is clearly visible on top of the left stone tower. The editing evidently removed or obscured this element in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the bridge tower retain its original light gray sandstone texture with visible block patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, despite the focus shift due to the statue, appears to have retained the general appearance of the Brooklyn Bridge. The structural texture of the bridge, known for its light gray sandstone and visible block patterns, seems to be consistent with the original architectural style. Image A clearly shows these features; thus, the structural integrity in terms of design appears unchanged upon analysis.",

      "question": "Is the Freedom Tower positioned behind and slightly to the right of the bridgeâ€™s central axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the view of the Freedom Tower is largely obstructed by the enormous statue. However, the composition of the skyline suggests that significant elements such as placement relative to bridge structures are still apparent to some extent. In Image A, the Freedom Tower is positioned behind and slightly to the right of the bridge's central axis, but in Image B, the statue alters the perceived skyline and tower positions, suggesting displacement due to the edit.",

      "question": "Is there a reflective surface of water directly beneath the bridge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B primarily focuses on the statue standing in the area where the river beneath the bridge should be clearly visible. This giant statue covers the area and makes the presence of water less discernible. Image A clearly shows the East River with a reflective water surface directly beneath the Brooklyn Bridge. The edit disrupts the visibility of this water surface.",

      "question": "Are the clouds in the sky distributed in a partly cloudy pattern with soft blue and white tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a partly cloudy sky with soft blue and white tones, typical of what can be seen in a general city skyline setup. The giant statue, being a digital addition, affects the skyline view but does not change the sky pattern itself. Image A also depicts a similar partly cloudy sky with soft blue and white tones, indicating no alteration in cloud depiction in the editing process.",

      "question": "Do the surrounding skyscrapers retain visible grid patterns of windows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the statue dominates the majority of the image, the skyscrapers in the background still retain visible details, including grid patterns of windows, consistent with typical cityscape architecture. In Image A, the skyscrapers naturally display the grid patterns that are common in modern buildings. Therefore, despite the edited statue, the architectural grid patterns are perceptible in both images.",
