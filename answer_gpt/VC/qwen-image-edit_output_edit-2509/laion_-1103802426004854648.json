    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the seahorse’s body shaped with a curved neck leading to a downward-curving tail, forming a recognizable seahorse silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object's body features a distinct curved neck that transitions into a downward-curving tail, creating a silhouette typical of a seahorse. This is confirmed by the visual information showing the characteristic bending of the neck and tail, forming the archetypal shape of a seahorse.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a music note symbol located within a heart shape on the central yellow belly section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the yellow belly section lacks a heart-shaped symbol. Instead, it features a treble clef music note, which is not inside any shape. The visual cue is the open positioning of this music note on the belly section, indicating that a heart shape does not enclose it.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a ribbon-like bow positioned at the top of the seahorse’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual analysis of Image B indicates that there is a purple ribbon-like structure positioned on the top of the seahorse's head, resembling a fin rather than a bow. The texture and placement give it a fin-like appearance rather than a knot tied like a bow.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there exactly two fins positioned on the sides of the seahorse’s body, near the midsection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two purple fins observable on either side of the midsection of the seahorse. The visual evidence supports this, as the fins are positioned symmetrically and horizontally on the mid-body part.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the eyes large, round, black with white highlights, and placed symmetrically on the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The seahorse in Image B has large, round eyes that are predominantly black with small white highlights, giving it a shiny appearance. These eyes are positioned symmetrically on the face, which is clear from the balanced visual layout.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the yellow belly section located centrally on the body and larger than the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the yellow belly section is centrally located on the body of the seahorse. However, visually, it is proportionally smaller compared to the head. The head is bulkier, indicating that the yellow belly is not larger than the head.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
