        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the humanoid robot is clearly visible with defined features, including a distinct head, torso, arms, and legs, similar to its depiction in typical sci-fi representations. This assessment is based on the visible presence of these components in the robotic form.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows flamingos around the robot. Although stylized, their shape and color are indicative of flamingos, evident from their distinguishable form with long necks and beaks. This conclusion relies on the stylized visual cues directly identifiable as flamingo features.",

      ],

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows palm trees in the background, but instead of rock formations, stylized geometrical shapes are depicted, which contrasts with the typical rock formations seen in Image A. Therefore, only palm trees are visible.",
