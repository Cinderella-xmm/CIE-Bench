      "question": "Is the skater captured mid-air while performing the trick?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater is shown above the ground with a skateboard underneath, suggesting a mid-air action. The position of the skater, with bent knees and a body tilt, is indicative of performing a skateboarding trick, aligning with common skateboarding photography where skaters are often captured in mid-air to show the dynamics of the trick. This suggests that the skater is indeed captured mid-air while performing a trick.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater's hat has visible geometric patterns, featuring repeated symbols and shapes typical of decorative hats. These visual cues suggest a pattern often used as a design element for decorative headwear. This indicates that the hat retains its geometric pattern.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard is observed beneath the skater with its underside facing the camera, which indicates that it is in mid-flip. The skateboard's orientation and the skater's posture suggest a moment commonly captured in skateboarding when a flip trick is being executed.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are tall structures and interspersed tree branches visible in the background. This combination forms a classic urban backdrop, where both architectural elements and natural elements coexist, particularly in street and skateboarding photography where such environments are often featured.",
