      "question": "Are there four clock faces, one on each visible side of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows a clock tower with two visible clock faces, each displaying the time on two different sides of the tower. Since only two sides of the tower are visible, it's not possible to confirm if there are clock faces on the remaining two sides based on this image alone. However, the typical design of a clock tower like this one suggests that it likely has four clock faces, one on each side. Despite the lack of visual confirmation from the image, this is a common architectural characteristic.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the clock faces contain black Roman numerals arranged in a circular pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock faces on the tower clearly display black Roman numerals arranged in a circle, which is a typical style for traditional clock towers. This orientation and design are standard for clock faces, where numerals are placed in a circular fashion to represent hours.",

      "question": "Is there a steeply pitched pyramidal roof topped with a finial at the very top of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the clock tower with a steeply pitched pyramidal roof at its summit. At the very top of this roof, there is an ornamental finial. This architectural structure is often used in clock towers for decorative purposes, and the shape is consistent with traditional designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there four arched openings at the base of the tower, one on each side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the tower is illustrated with arched openings visible on each side that can be seen. Common sense and typical architectural styles of such structures imply that there would usually be one on each side, making a total of four. However, only two sides are visible in the image, so we can infer this based on symmetrical design.",

      "question": "Is the tower located at the center of a circular road with vehicles traveling around it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the tower positioned in the middle of a roundabout. The road encircles the tower, indicating it's at the center of a circular traffic system. Vehicles are shown navigating around it, confirming this is a roundabout.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several cars are clearly depicted driving on the circular road around the tower. This suggests moderate traffic flow around the structure, affirming that there are indeed multiple vehicles seen in the image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Are there trees with bare or sparse foliage visible along the road behind the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of trees surrounding the roundabout shows them with full, lush green foliage. This suggests a summer or springtime setting, contrasting with Image A where trees might have been bare or sparse, indicating a different season. Hence, this edited image doesn't show bare trees.",
