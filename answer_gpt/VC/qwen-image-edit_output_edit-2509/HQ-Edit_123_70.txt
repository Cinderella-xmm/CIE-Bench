    "Question": "Q1: Is the bear's body shaped with a distinct hump over the shoulders and a broad, muscular back?",
    "explanation": "The bear in Image B is portrayed in a standing position, making it difficult to observe a distinct hump over the shoulders. Typically, a hump is associated with certain bear species like grizzly bears due to muscle development for digging. Since the bear is upright, the body features relevant to this question are not distinctly visible.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the salmon have a clearly defined forked tail fin?",
    "explanation": "The salmon depicted in the right section of Image B appears submerged underwater, making tail features indistinct. The diagram does not show a clear tail shape, focusing more on the salmon’s life cycle stages than specific physical features. Given this visual context, the forked tail is not discernible.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the bear’s fur rendered with visible texture and layered shading, showing wetness and depth?",
    "explanation": "Image B portrays the bear in a cartoonish style, lacking detailed fur texture and layered shading. The style does not emphasize realism or depict wetness and depth typically observed in more textured artwork.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the salmon colored with a blue-green back and a silvery-white belly?",
    "explanation": "The fish shown underwater in the diagram section of Image B lacks distinct coloration details typically seen when describing salmon. The visual mainly illustrates the life cycle, and colors like blue-green back or silvery-white belly are not evident.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there visible water splashes or ripples around the bear’s lower legs?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bear is standing on solid ground within a forest setting, making the presence of water splashes or ripples around its legs implausible. This depiction deviates from any aquatic interaction.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the bear have a long, broad snout with visible nostrils and a rounded muzzle?",
    "explanation": "The bear in Image B is illustrated with a simplified, cartoon-like face and minimal anatomical detail, making a long, broad snout and distinct nostril features absent. The style is not indicative of detailed anatomical or realistic features.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the salmon positioned horizontally in the bear’s mouth, with its head protruding forward?",
    "explanation": "The right panel of Image B utilizes a diagram form to show a fish vertically in water connected to life stage labels. The illustration does not depict a bear or its mouth at all, meaning there's no salmon positioned within a bear's mouth.",
    "answer": "No"
