      "question": "Is the dark, glossy texture of the chocolate sauce preserved in the sneaker design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sneaker design prominently features a dark brown color with a noticeably glossy finish, resembling the sheen observed in chocolate sauce. This similarity is apparent in the way the light reflects off the surface of both the sauce and the sneaker, implying that the texture and glossiness of the chocolate sauce have been maintained in the sneaker design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the flowing, pooling patterns of the chocolate sauce represented in the sneaker’s form or material application?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sneaker in Image B has a structured and defined form lacking the organic, fluid lines and pooling seen in the chocolate sauce on the cake. The shoe features conventional panels typical of sneaker construction rather than emulating the flowing, liquid patterns of the sauce, indicating that the fluidity and pooling of the sauce have not been incorporated into the sneaker’s design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sneaker incorporate ruffled, organic contours inspired by the lettuce’s shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sneaker includes a representation of lettuce placed around the collar area, which retains the ruffled, organic contours characteristic of real lettuce. This is indicative of a design translation of the lettuce’s natural ruffled shape into the sneaker's design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the reflective surface of the chocolate sauce maintained in the sneaker’s material finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sneaker in Image B has a glossy, reflective surface similar to the chocolate sauce's surface in Image A. The reflection of light on the sneaker’s material is consistent with the glossy texture of the sauce, indicating that the reflective quality has been carried over into the sneaker’s finish.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a clear contrast between dark chocolate-inspired elements and green lettuce-inspired elements in the sneaker design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sneaker exhibits a distinct contrast between its dark brown, chocolate-inspired elements and the bright green lettuce-inspired attributes at the collar area. This difference in color and texture highlights a deliberate contrast, aligning with the colors and materials evident in the edited design.",
