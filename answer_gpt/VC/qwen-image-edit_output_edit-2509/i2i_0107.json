        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style character indeed has round glasses. This matches with the typical depiction of the character they are representing, who is known for wearing round glasses. Based on the chibi art style, where key characteristics are exaggerated or retained for recognizability, the round glasses are a notable feature that would likely be preserved in such a representation.",
