    "Question": "Q1: Does the image retain the natural wool texture of the sheep?",

}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the sheep retain their darker facial and leg markings?",

    "Question": "Q3: Is the grassy field setting retained, including the distribution of sheep?",
    "explanation": "Image B appears in a completely different context, focusing solely on two cartoon characters in a presumably indoor setting with a sports-related theme, eliminating the grassy field scene.",

}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the tree line marking the field's border retained?",
