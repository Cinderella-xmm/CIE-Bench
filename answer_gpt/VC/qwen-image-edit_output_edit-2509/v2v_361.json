      "question": "Does the keychain retain the dog's original fur pattern with a mix of dark and light tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which depicts the chibi keychain of a dog, the fur pattern is stylized rather than realistic. The colors used are predominantly orange and black, which do not closely resemble the dog's original mix of dark and light tones as seen in Image A. Therefore, the keychain does not retain the dog's original fur pattern.",

      "question": "Is the chibi keychain oriented in a way that suggests it is looking toward the fire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the chibi keychain in a position where the depicted dog character is facing forward, looking directly at the viewer. It is not oriented in a way that suggests it is looking toward an external element like a fire. Therefore, it is not looking toward the fire.",

      "question": "Is the dark rectangular pedestal still present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main subject is the chibi keychain held in a hand, with no other elements present such as a pedestal. Image A depicts a dark pedestal alongside a real dog, but no similar object appears in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the background retain its dark, moody appearance with scattered orange sparks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a plain, neutral gray background that is simply there to set off the keychain, rather than a dark and moody backdrop with sparks. This contrasts sharply with Image A, which has a dramatic, spark-filled, dark background. Therefore, the background in Image B is neutral and does not retain the appearance from Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design of the chibi keychain in Image B indeed features perked-up ears, which is a characteristic retained from the dog in Image A. The exaggerated style of the chibi keychain highlights this feature prominently.",
