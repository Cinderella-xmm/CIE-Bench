      "question": "Does the hammer retain its claw-shaped end and dual-headed structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer appears with a claw on one side and a flat surface on the other, indicating a claw-shaped end and dual-headed structure, common in many hammers for functions like pulling nails and pounding surfaces. Without comparing to Image A, the hammer in Image B retains these features typical of such tools.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the chisel retain its flat, rectangular blade with a beveled edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the chisel can be seen with a flat blade resembling a rectangle and with an edge that appears beveled, useful for woodworking to shave or carve out wood. This shape is characteristic of chisels, indicating it retains the flat and beveled features expected.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the file retain its long, straight, narrow shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the file shows a straight-line structure that's long and narrow, fitting the typical design of metal files used for shaping or smoothing surfaces. The visual cues in Image B confirm it's a long, straight, narrow tool.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the tools positioned in the same relative arrangement as in the original image (e.g., hammer diagonal, chisel crossing file)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, while both images have the tools set in a similar cluster, their specific spatial arrangement differs. In Image B, the positioning deviates from the exact alignments seen in Image A. For instance, in Image A, tools appear intertwined differently especially the chisel crossing the file, which is not the case in Image B.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shavings retain their curled, ribbon-like shape and approximate distribution around the tools?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shavings are transformed into artistic swirling patterns instead of typical curled ribbons seen from wood shavings. Their arrangement is more decorative, and they don't maintain the natural approximate distribution around the tools found in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there exactly five tools present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examining the image shows five distinct tools positioned: a hammer, chisel, file, wrench-like tool, and an additional lever-like tool. This confirms there are exactly five tools present in the image, matching what is seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the wrench-like tool retain its open-ended jaw and metal shaft shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a tool resembling a wrench with an open-ended jaw, designed for gripping or turning nuts and bolts, combined with a metal shaft typical of wrench designs. This matches common wrench characteristics and suggests it maintains the expected shape.",
