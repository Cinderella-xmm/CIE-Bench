        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycles are depicted in bright, solid colors: red, yellow, and black. Image A shows bicycles in red, blue, beige, and black. The difference in colors indicates that the original colors have not been preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the original designs and structural details of the bicycles preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents bicycles with a simplified, more cartoonish design, lacking detailed components like chains and pedals, which are clearly visible in Image A. This indicates that the original design and structural details have not been preserved.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement of the bicycles in terms of spacing and alignment is consistent between Image A and Image B, with three bicycles appearing similarly spaced and positioned, suggesting that the original arrangement and relative positions are preserved.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shadows in Image B are aligned with the grid of the window behind the bicycles, similar to Image A. This indicates that the shadow alignment has been preserved in terms of general direction and location.",
