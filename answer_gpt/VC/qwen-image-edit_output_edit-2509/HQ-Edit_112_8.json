      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the ornate embossed pattern on the typewriter’s base clearly visible and preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image introduces a sepia tone overlay and graphical additions like smoke and frame, but the typewriter's ornate embossed pattern on its base is still discernible. The sepia treatment could have altered the contrast slightly, but the decorative elements remain intact and visible.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the cylindrical metal keys arranged in a QWERTY layout with visible spacing and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the cylindrical metal keys are organized in a manner that appears to reflect a QWERTY layout. The sepia and additional edits like smoke mildly affect visibility, yet the arrangement's traditional pattern is discernible.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a blank sheet of paper inserted into the typewriter’s roller mechanism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has added a graphical element that suggests movement or transformation with the smoke effect, which could obscure the view of the typewriter’s features including the paper. The sepia treatment complicates visibility, yet a blank sheet of paper does appear to be inserted and visible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the ceramic mug with a visible logo or design present on the desk to the left of the typewriter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, the ceramic mug is indeed present on the desk to the left of the typewriter. Given the sepia color overlay, exact details like a logo or specific design are less clear but a mug is positioned there.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the table lamp with a beige fabric shade and classical columnar base positioned to the left of the typewriter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the sepia tone and other graphical edits, the table lamp with its distinct classical columnar base and beige fabric shade is identifiable to the left of the typewriter.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the wooden desk surface with natural wood grain and light reflection clearly visible beneath the typewriter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a sepia treatment that alters the coloration but does not obscure the wood grain or light reflections of the desk surface. The grain and reflection details remain visible under the typewriter.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, additional sepia tone and border decoration could reduce visual clarity; however, the framed painting remains visible on the upper right wall. The winding road and hills are recognizable despite the sepia color constraints.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the round analog clock with visible hour markers and hands mounted on the wall below the landscape painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sepia effect in Image B reduces contrast, yet the round analog clock with its hour markers and hands remains visible below the landscape painting. The sepia treatment might slightly obscure fine details but the clock's presence is unmistakable.",
