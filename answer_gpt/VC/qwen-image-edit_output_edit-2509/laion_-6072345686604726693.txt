    "Question": "Q1: Are the four minarets positioned symmetrically—two on the left and two on the right—relative to the central dome?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object appears to be a fantastical structure with architectural elements similar to a central dome, but there are no minarets. Instead, it has organic and ornate extensions, resembling wings. In Image A, the Hagia Sophia is flanked by four minarets, two on each side, which are symmetrically positioned around the central dome. Therefore, Image B does not have minarets positioned symmetrically like in Image A.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the 15 July Martyrs Bridge clearly visible in the background, crossing the water behind the Hagia Sophia?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of a cosmic space-like environment with stars and nebulous patterns, not a terrestrial cityscape. Thus, no bridge is visible.
