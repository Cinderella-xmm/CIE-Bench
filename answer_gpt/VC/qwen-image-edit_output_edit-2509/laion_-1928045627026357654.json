      "question": "Is the man’s long curly hair tied into a low ponytail present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's hair is depicted as a long, curly style that is not tied into a ponytail. The style appears free-flowing rather than being gathered at the neck, which is typical for a low ponytail. In Image A, the man's hair is similar but also not tied into a low ponytail. Based on the visual cues and the typical appearance of a low ponytail, it is clear that the hairstyle does not match this description.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a silver hoop earring visible in the man’s left ear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's ear is not clearly visible enough to identify specific jewelry such as a silver hoop earring. This is a stylized or edited illustration where details like earrings might not be prominently displayed. Compared to Image A, where the earring presence or absence is also not clearly visible, it is consistent to conclude that there is no noticeable earring in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the woman have a long black braid over her right shoulder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s hairstyle is an elegant updo with no clear braid visible, and certainly not one draping over her right shoulder. The stylized fashion of the illustration focuses on volume and shape, differing from the braided style seen in Image A, where the woman has a long braid cascading over her shoulder. Hence, the hairstyle in Image B does not include a braid, according to visual evidence and understanding of hair styling.",

      "question": "Are the woman’s lips colored pink?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image does not provide clear visibility of lip color due to the artistic design that emphasizes bold outfit colors and abstract forms. While Image A does not explicitly show lip color in detail, it can be inferred that facial features, including lip color, may not have been a focus in the stylized representation of Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do both individuals wear shirts of the same pinkish-red color with a white dot pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both individuals wear shirts with a bold, geometrically patterned fabric that features bright, contrasting colors. The pattern is significantly different from the subtle pinkish-red color with white dot pattern observed in Image A. This indicates a shift to dynamic, attention-grabbing designs in the edited version, deviating from the more subdued fashion of Image A.",

      "question": "Are the woman’s hands placed on the man’s shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s hands are positioned differently, styled to illustrate an artistic, lively pose rather than resting on the man's shoulders. This contrasts with Image A where the woman’s hands are placed on the man's shoulders, allowing for a clear conclusion that the hand positioning has changed between the images.",

      "question": "Does the man have a full beard and mustache?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design of the figure’s face appears simplified and does not clearly show facial hair details such as a beard or mustache due to the stylized representation. Comparing that with Image A, where no full beard is evident either, it's reasonable to determine based solely on the current design that a full beard and mustache are not visible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man’s outfit still appears to include dark pants similar to Image A. However, the woman is wearing highly stylized, voluminous pants with a different texture and form, departing from the simpler gray pants she wore in Image A. This indicates that while the man’s pants may remain dark, the woman’s pants have been altered significantly.",
