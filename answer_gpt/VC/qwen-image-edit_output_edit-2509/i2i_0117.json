        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character still wears a mask that covers the entire face and features geometric designs, including pointed ears, which is a signature element of the Black Panther's mask.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's suit maintains the detailed panther-scale texture and black coloring that is typical of the Black Panther's suit.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the metallic claw-like accents are still present on the shoulders and chest of the suit.
