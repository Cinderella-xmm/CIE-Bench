    "Question": "Q1: Is the mountain depicted as a symmetrical, perfectly conical shape with a pointed peak?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain is sculpted within a glass container and is depicted with a smooth, symmetrical, and somewhat conical shape that can appear perfect due to its constructed appearance. However, while it does have a pointed peak, the scale and setting suggest it's not intended to perfectly mimic natural imperfections and asymmetries seen in real mountains. The miniature and simplified style contributes to the perception of symmetry and perfection.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the summit of the mountain have a continuous white snow cap covering the top?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain's summit is depicted with a continuous white covering resembling snow. The visual cue is the white layer on the top portion of the mountain, typical for depicting snow-capped mountains in such miniature artworks, providing the appearance of a snow cover.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a clear, mirror-like reflection of the mountain in the lake below?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lake within the glass container does not reflect the mountain above in a mirror-like fashion. The lake is part of the miniature landscape model, which suggests that it's not functional as a reflective surface. The context of the display is more artistic and decorative rather than mirroring reality with reflections.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there small structures or buildings positioned along the edge of the lake, between the water and the mountain base?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows small structures, specifically miniature wooden cabins, strategically placed along the edge of the lake, nestled within the miniature landscape. These structures are positioned between the water of the lake and the base of the mountain, following the typical assembly of a miniature diorama.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the sky visible above the mountain, appearing as a solid or gradient blue area?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain scene does not extend to include a sky. Instead, the area above the mountain within the glass bowl appears empty or shows the surrounding environment's background. The lack of blue or any sky representation implies that Image B does not display a visible sky.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there visible layers on the mountainâ€™s slopes, showing a transition from white snow at the top to darker rock and then to green/brown vegetation below?",
    "explanation": "Image B portrays a mountain in a crafted style, showing visible layers from the snow-covered summit transitioning to darker and then green slopes. In this model, there are representations of snow, rocky areas, and vegetation using different colors and materials, which visually indicate the transition of zones typically found on a real mountain.",
    "answer": "Yes"
