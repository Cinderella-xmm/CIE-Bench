      "question": "Is the leaf in the edited image still ovate with a pointed tip and serrated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the leaf retains its ovate shape with a pointed tip, which is characterized by a broad base narrowing to a point. The edges appear to be serrated, consistent with many natural leaves. The shape and edges are visually similar to the typical structure of a leaf, reflecting the same characteristics as in the original image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the leaf retain the prominent central vein with branching secondary veins forming a network across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining the edited image, the central vein of the leaf is clearly visible, with secondary veins branching out to form a network, which is a common feature of many leaves. This structural detail remains consistent with the original image, highlighting the venation pattern typical of leaves.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the leaf still golden-yellow with visible brown speckles and natural discolorations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leaf in the edited image is presented as golden-yellow, with visible brown speckles and natural discolorations that give it a realistic appearance. These color features are indicative of a leaf in a natural state during certain seasons, typically autumn, and align with observations from the original image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the leaf retain its papery texture and minor surface imperfections such as blemishes or spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the leaf maintains a papery texture, which is discernible through its slight imperfections like blemishes or spots on its surface. These textural elements suggest realism and align with the details observed in the original image, indicating the leaf's natural condition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the leaf oriented with the stem pointing toward the upper left and the blade extending diagonally across the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leaf in the edited image is oriented such that the stem points toward the upper left, and the blade extends diagonally across the frame. This positioning is consistent with the orientation observed in the original image, as the direction and placement of the leaf remain unchanged.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the leaf the sole central object in the edited image, without any other competing elements in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the leaf is enclosed in a glass sphere, serving as a prominent focal point. However, the addition of the decorative elements like the glass sphere and the background setting reduces the exclusivity of the leaf as the sole central object. Unlike the original image, which features only the leaf on water, the edited image introduces additional visual elements.",
