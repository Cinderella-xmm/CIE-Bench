    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the figure shown in profile, facing left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is facing forward rather than in profile. We assess the orientation of the figure by looking at the alignment of the chest and shoulders. A profile view would present the side of the body towards the viewer, which is not the case here.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the right hand grip a long vertical object extending downward from the shoulder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right hand indeed grips a long vertical object, a staff or scepter, which appears to be extending downward from the shoulder area, indicated by the posture and hand position.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors in the image golden, ochre, and earthy browns, consistent with the original sunset lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B predominantly features shades of gold, ochre, and earthy browns. These colors align with elements like the armor, cape, and the landscape background, consistent with a warm color palette typical of sunset scenes.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the legs positioned slightly apart, with weight distributed evenly, suggesting a stable stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's legs are set apart, indicating a wide stance. The distribution and positioning suggest a balanced weight distribution conducive to a stable posture.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left arm is not relaxed or hanging straight down the body. It is bent and holds an object, which indicates an active rather than relaxed stance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the figure located in the foreground, with open space behind it leading to distant hills or structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B places the figure prominently in the foreground, with a landscape that opens into distant hills and a castle structure in the background, describing the scene's layout.",
