      "question": "Is there a visible red flower-like motif present in the central area of the transformed object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a decorative object resembling an egg with an intricate design. The design features a phoenix with vibrant wings, covering most of the egg's surface. The central area of the object prominently displays the phoenix rather than a flower-like motif, which is typically characterized by multiple petals emanating from a central point. Without a distinct red flower-like motif, the answer appears to be informed by recognizing traditional floral patterns versus the current artistic depiction of the phoenix.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a continuous blue geometric pattern forming a border near the upper edge of the transformed object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design on Image B includes an array of swirling and colorful patterns, but these do not form a clear, continuous blue geometric pattern like a border at the top. Such a pattern would imply a repeated or structured motif typically found as an encircling design, which is absent in the vibrant, free-flowing design on the egg.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there green leaf-like shapes integrated into the surface design of the transformed object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artistic design primarily showcases a phoenix with intricate feather-like patterns rather than distinct green leaf-like shapes. These feather motifs are more dominant, and while various colors are present, the design doesnâ€™t explicitly incorporate shapes that are unmistakably identified as green leaves.",

      "question": "Are the patterns outlined in black to define individual elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's design incorporates bold outlines that help define the vibrant colors and intricate shapes on the egg, much like how black outlines enhance the contrast and visibility between different colored areas on a design. This technique is evident in the phoenix's feathers and other decorative elements.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the pattern arrangement radially symmetric around the center of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the phoenix motif does not exhibit radial symmetry, which is symmetry around a central point. Instead, the design is more directional, with the phoenix spreading its wings across the egg. Radial symmetry would imply a consistent pattern emanating from the center outward, which doesn't align with the current depiction.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors blue, red, green, and black used throughout the design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B highlights a vibrant design primarily focused on a colorful phoenix. While colors such as red and blue are prominent, along with black for outlining, orange and other colors take a more significant role. Hence, saying blue, red, green, and black are the dominant colors may not be entirely accurate based on the visible usage in the depiction.",

      "question": "Is the transformed cup (now phoenix egg) positioned within or upon the transformed saucer (now nest)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an egg-like object perched within a nest-like structure, reminiscent of how an egg would naturally be situated. This configuration suggests that the phoenix egg (originally a cup) is indeed positioned upon or within the crafted nest (originally a saucer), reflecting a visual relationship between the two components.",
