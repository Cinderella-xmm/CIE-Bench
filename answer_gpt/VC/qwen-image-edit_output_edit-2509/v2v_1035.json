      "question": "Does the image retain the brown and white pattern characteristic of a giraffe on the nesting dolls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the nesting dolls feature vibrant colors such as blue, red, and other floral patterns, rather than the characteristic brown and white spotted pattern of a giraffe. The visual cues in Image B strongly suggest a departure from any giraffe-like coloration. The use of different colors and designs indicates a stylistic representation typical of traditional Russian nesting dolls, not a giraffe's pattern.",

      "question": "Are the ossicones visible on the heads of the nesting dolls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Ossicones are the distinctive horn-like structures found on top of a giraffe's head. In Image B, the nesting dolls do not have any resembling structures on their heads. Their tops are smooth and feature various colors and designs, consistent with traditional nesting dolls. The lack of any protrusions similar to ossicones leads to the conclusion that they are not present.",

      "question": "Do the nesting dolls have elongated necks resembling those of giraffes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The key feature of a giraffe is its long neck. In Image B, the nesting dolls have typical proportions seen in such dolls, with no elongated necks. The head and body are proportionate to the iconic style of a matryoshka doll, making the conclusion that they lack the elongated necks characteristic of giraffes.",

      "question": "Are the nesting dolls arranged in descending sizes on the wooden table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are clearly placed in order by size, from largest to smallest, on a wooden table. This arrangement is common for nesting dolls, which are designed to fit into one another sequentially. The boards of the table also show this orderly layout, supporting the idea that they are purposefully displayed in descending order of size.",

      "question": "Do the nesting dolls have long legs resembling those of a giraffe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Nesting dolls typically have a rounded bottom that allows them to stand upright, and in Image B, they follow this traditional design without any visible leg-like structures. Giraffes are known for their long legs supporting their bodies, which is not the case here. The dolls' bases are smooth and rounded, making it clear they do not feature giraffe-like legs.",
