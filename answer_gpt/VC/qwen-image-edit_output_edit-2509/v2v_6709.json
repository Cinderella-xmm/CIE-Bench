      "question": "Is the faceted star-shaped pattern covering the body of the perfume bottle preserved in the Lego version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle maintains its original design, including the faceted star-shaped pattern. The bottle itself has not been altered in terms of texture or pattern in the Lego version. This conclusion is drawn from observing the consistent detailing on the glass body, which remains clear and undisturbed by the surrounding Lego construction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the perfume bottle maintain its cylindrical shape with tapered sides and flat base in the Lego construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of Image B shows that the perfume bottle retains its original shape without any modification. Despite being placed within a Lego environment, the bottle's shape remains cylindrical with tapered sides and a flat base. This observation relies on the visual consistency in the shape of the bottle between the original and edited versions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the gold faceted spherical cap positioned at the top of the bottle preserved in the Lego version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold faceted spherical cap on the perfume bottle appears unchanged. It is visibly atop the bottle, maintaining its design and finish. This correctness of the cap's preservation is determined by the unchanged placement and structure observed in the edited image compared to the original.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the spray nozzle located on the side of the bottleâ€™s neck, with a visible mist plume extending diagonally outward, preserved in the Lego version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows that the spray nozzle and the mist are consistent with the original. The mist plume extends diagonally outward, demonstrating the action of spraying. This can be verified by observing the spray mechanism and mist pattern, which appear identical in execution between the two images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the undulating folds of the fabric background beneath the bottle preserved in form and position in the Lego version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background has been changed from fabric to a Lego base. The soft, undulating folds of the fabric are replaced by the structured, flat Lego blocks, altering the form and texture significantly. This evaluation is based on the observed difference in the visual and tactile nature of the backdrop between the two images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the perfume bottle positioned directly on top of the fabric background, maintaining contact and alignment with the folds, in the Lego version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the perfume bottle positioned atop the structured Lego base rather than fabric. Instead of interacting with folds, it rests on the flat Lego surface. This observation comes from the difference in alignment and surface interaction noted between the two backgrounds.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the size of the gold cap proportionally consistent with the body of the bottle in the Lego version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, it is evident that the proportionality of the gold cap to the bottle remains consistent. The sizing and placement of the cap do not deviate from the original, reflecting a maintained ratio between the two components of the bottle. This assessment draws on the direct comparison of cap and bottle proportions between the original and edited images.",
