        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character features a chibi-style representation, and the helmet on the character lacks prominent details due to the cartoonish nature of the design. The visual style of Image B suggests that the focus is on simplified, exaggerated attributes rather than intricate details, such as a central feather. Thus, there is no indication of a feather-like adornment based on the visual cues.",
