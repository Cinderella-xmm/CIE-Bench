      "question": "Is the wooden windowsill with visible grain and paneling along the lower edge present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface where the cloud-like figure rests is depicted with grain and paneling design similar to wood, matching the characteristics of a wooden windowsill observed in home settings. Despite its artistic changes, these details are consistent with those typically found in traditional windowsills.",

      "question": "Are the sheer white curtains draped to the left side of the window visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are sheer white curtains visible on the left side of the window. This placement is nearly identical to standard curtain arrangements, where they are gathered to one side to let in light, and the presence of these curtains suggests consistency with typical interior designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the window frame with vertical lines and glass panes visible behind the cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the surreal transformation of the cat into a cloud-like creature, the window frame with vertical lines and clear glass panes remains unchanged and visible. This structure denotes the architectural feature of a window in both real and artistically reimagined settings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background through the window clearly shows a blue sky with white clouds, typical of a clear day. This setting is a common artistic detail to elicit tranquility and is consistent with commonplace observations of daytime skies.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B continues to show a distinctly knitted surface under the cloud-like creature's head, reminiscent of a fabric or blanket. This texture aligns with the description of a knitted blanket used for comfort, maintaining its function despite the artistic transformation of the cat.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are diagonal sunlight rays cast from the window that create shadows on the windowsill. This illumination effect is commonly used in images to suggest direct sunlight entry and the passage of time, establishing realism despite the fantastical elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure that was previously a cat is now a cloud-like creature that retains the curled posture with its head seemingly resting on the blanket-like surface. This posture aligns with common resting behaviors of cats, even with the symbolic transformation.",
