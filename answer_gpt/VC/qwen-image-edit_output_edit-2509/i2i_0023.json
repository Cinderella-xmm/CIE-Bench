      "question": "Does the boy's face retain clear and recognizable features such as eyes, nose, and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face is simplified into a stylized illustration typical of avatars or stickers. The face contains basic representations of eyes, a nose, and a mouth, characteristic of minimalist, cartoon-style artwork. Though these features exist, they are not detailed or realistic as seen in Image A, but rather abstract and stylized in appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are all four original birds present, with the macaw on the shoulder, the cockatoo on the arm, the canary on the head, and the parakeet near the side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all four birds are present and positioned similarly to Image A. The macaw is on one shoulder, the cockatoo on the arm, the yellow canary is positioned above the center of the head, and the parakeet is near the other side. This reflects a continuation of their original arrangement but translated into a graphical form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cartoon print on the boy's green T-shirt still visible and intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon print on the green T-shirt is captured in a similar manner as in Image A. The graphic of the cartoon characters is intact and recognizable, indicating that this detail translated well into the vector-style illustration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the boy’s head visibly larger compared to the shrunken size of the birds in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boy’s head appears proportionate to the body, as is typical in cartoon-style illustrations, rather than an exaggerated or enlarged head. The birds are of comparable proportion to the boy as they appeared in Image A, suggesting no intentional resizing to alter their scale relative to each other.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image feature a thick white outline around the boy and the birds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire illustration of the boy and birds is encompassed by a thick white outline. This design choice is common in creating sticker-like visuals, which provides a cohesive border separating the characters from the background.",
