      "question": "Is the butterfly still positioned centrally in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, as I examine the composition, the butterfly remains positioned at the center, drawing immediate attention. Center placement is a common compositional technique to highlight the main subject effectively. This analysis is based solely on the symmetry and framing visible in Image B, reflecting the butterfly's visual primacy.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the butterfly retain its blue color theme, even if reinterpreted as energy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B is enveloped in a swirling, ethereal blue light resembling energy, while the butterfly’s body itself appears blue. This interpretation combines the butterfly’s visual presentation with common associations of blue with energy and mysticism in art. Therefore, its blue color theme is retained, even if expressed through an energetic reinterpretation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the dark silhouette below the butterfly retain its general rugged shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silhouette in Image B demonstrates characteristics of a rugged terrain as it includes jagged, uneven edges suggesting a crevice or rift. This ruggedness aligns with the general shape of the silhouette observed in Image A, where rugged silhouettes infer rocky or uneven terrain.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the butterfly still depicted as hovering above the dark silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly appears to be hovering above a dark silhouette, which visually aligns with the idea of it being in a state of suspension in the air, as per common portrayals of butterflies. The butterfly’s depiction against the silhouetted foreground suggests upward motion or hovering due to the light and shadow play, retaining its position relative to the silhouette.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the dark silhouette below the butterfly retain its dark color contrast with the butterfly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The contrast in Image B is evident between the dark silhouette and the bright blue aura and butterfly above it. This contrast enhances the butterfly’s visibility, similar to the visual technique of using light against dark to create depth and focus, maintaining the contrast as observed initially in Image A.",
