    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the cabinâ€™s roof clearly shaped as an A-frame with snow covering its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roof of the cabin is shaped in a classic A-frame style, consistent with the steep angles and appearance typically associated with such a design. Snow is visibly covering the surface of the roof, which is common in a snowy environment. World knowledge such as architectural styles and typical snowfall in winter landscapes reinforce this understanding.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a chimney located at the peak of the roof, from which smoke is rising?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chimney in Image B is positioned at the peak of the roof, a typical location for cabin chimneys to efficiently disperse smoke. Smoke is visibly rising from the chimney, indicating the presence of heat or a fire inside the cabin. The visual cues combined with knowledge of typical cabin structures support this.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there exactly three illuminated windows on the upper level and three on the lower level, including one central window on the ground floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two illuminated windows on the upper level and only two on the lower level, without a central window on the ground floor. Observing the window details combined with typical architectural layouts leads to this assessment.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the walls of the cabin constructed from visible horizontal logs with chinking between them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cabin displays walls appearing to be made from horizontal logs, a typical construction method for log cabins. The visual texture and organization of these logs suggest authenticity. Knowledge of log cabin construction, which typically includes chinking for insulation and stability, supports this understanding.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there tall, snow-covered evergreen fir trees surrounding the cabin on all sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows numerous tall evergreen trees surrounding the cabin, covered by snow. This common scene in winter forested landscapes suggests fir trees through visual cues and common tree shapes known in colder climates.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there smoke visibly rising vertically from the chimney into the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The smoke in Image B is illustrated as rising in a more curvilinear pattern rather than vertically. This observation requires careful inspection of the smoke shape and behavior common with wind conditions affecting smoke trajectory.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts glowing lights strung along the cabin's roofline beneath the eaves. These lights are brightly lit, consistent with decorative outdoor lighting commonly used during festive or winter seasons.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several small shrubs are visibly located on either side of the porch, covered with snow. Observing these botanical elements in the scene combined with laying snow patterns informs this conclusion.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a split-rail fence apparent in the foreground and buried partially in snow. Such fencing is typical in rural environments, especially around cabins, implying a classic style and confirming through visual cues.",
