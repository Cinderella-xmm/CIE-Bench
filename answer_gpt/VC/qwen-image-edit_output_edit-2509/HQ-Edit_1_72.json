      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's facial features are blurred, making it impossible to visually assess the nose, lips, eyes, or skin tone. This alteration means these facial details are not retained in the edited image. Therefore, using reasoning based on the visible blurring, the conclusion is drawn that the facial features are not preserved.",
