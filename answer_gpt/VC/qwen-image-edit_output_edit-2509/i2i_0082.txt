    "Question": "Q1: Is the clock frame still circular in shape?",
    "explanation": "By observing Image B, the keychain clock features a circular frame. My world knowledge about clocks suggests that while frames can come in various shapes, circular is one of the most common due to its even spacing for marking time. Considering these observations, the frame in Image B is indeed circular.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Do the proportions of the clock hands and line markers remain consistent with the original?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the clock hands and line markers appear similar in proportion to those in Image A. Both images depict relatively thin and elongated clock hands that extend towards the edge of the clock face, aligning with common design principles for readability. The proportions observed in Image B appear consistent with those in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the clock face still white with black line markers?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the clock with a white face featuring black line markers, matching the description given. This color scheme, commonly used for its high contrast and readability, aligns with common clock designs. Given these observations, the clock face in Image B maintains the same colors as Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there still no numerals on the clock face?",
    "explanation": "In both images, the clock face is designed without numerals, relying solely on line markers. This minimalist design, often found in modern clocks, uses markers instead of numbers for a clean look. The absence of numerals in Image B, as in Image A, confirms consistency in this design feature.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the clock hands and markers positioned relatively the same as in the original?",
    "explanation": "Upon analyzing the position of the clock hands and markers in Image B, they appear to point to approximately the same positions as those in Image A, with the minute hand near the 4 and the hour hand pointing slightly past the 10, suggesting a time around 10:08. This alignment indicates that the positions are relatively the same between both images.",
    "answer": "Yes"
