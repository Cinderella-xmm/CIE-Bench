    "Question": "Q1: Is the subject wearing bright red lipstick?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the face of the subject is blurred, making it impossible to see the details of their lips. Therefore, based solely on the visual information available, we cannot determine the color of any lipstick that may be worn. Thus, we conclude that the information is not sufficient to make a determination.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the sunglasses black with a rectangular frame and reflective lenses?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, even with the blurred region, we can still observe the shape and color of the sunglasses. The sunglasses appear to be darkly colored, likely black, and although the details on reflection are minimal due to the blur, they seem to have a rectangular frame. Using world knowledge, rectangular frames are a common design, supporting this observation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the subject’s hair pulled back tightly, revealing her forehead and ears?",
    "explanation": "Despite the blur over the face area in Image B, the hair appears to be smooth and pulled back. This suggests a hairstyle that reveals the forehead but not necessarily the ears, as they are not visible in the image. Hair pulled back tightly generally means such visibility, but specific evidence of ears is uncertain.",
