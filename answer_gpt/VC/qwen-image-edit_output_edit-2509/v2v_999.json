      "question": "Is the bathtub still present with its wooden panel exterior and positioned in the same corner of the bathroom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bathtub is present in the corner of the bathroom with its wooden panels visible. This aligns with typical bathroom setups where bathtubs are often positioned in corners to utilize space efficiently. When comparing with Image A, the bathtub is indeed in the same corner and with the same exterior, fulfilling the conditions of the question.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays wall tiles with a floral pattern comprising small green leaves on a neutral background. This pattern matches the style often used for bathroom wall tiles providing a decorative, traditional appearance.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the towel rack is positioned next to the sink, and it has a beige towel hanging on it. This setup is typical in bathrooms where towels are kept near the sink for convenience. Comparatively, in Image A, the towel rack is also positioned next to the sink with a similar beige towel, indicating no change in these elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible lighting fixture where the cabinet was originally placed, instead a large Russian nesting doll occupies the space above this location. In Image A, the lighting fixture is clearly visible above the cabinet. The absence of the light fixture in Image B suggests a change in this area.",

      "question": "Are the new chibi-style Russian nesting dolls placed along the edge of the bathtub, maintaining the spatial arrangement of the original fixtures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, chibi-style Russian nesting dolls are positioned along the edge of the bathtub, both on and around the faucets, this alters the spatial arrangement as the faucet now has dolls instead of being clear as in typical scenarios. When comparing with Image A, the bathtub edge was clear without any additional objects, indicating that the original spatial arrangement is not maintained.",
