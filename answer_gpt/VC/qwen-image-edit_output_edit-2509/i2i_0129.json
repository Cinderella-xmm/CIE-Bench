      "question": "Does the surfer maintain his original balancing posture on the manta ray?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfer is seen riding a manta ray, and his posture is consistent with how surfers typically balance themselves on a surfboard. In Image A, the surfer is maintaining a balanced posture on a wave. By comparing both images, it appears the surferâ€™s posture is similar in both, as it involves balancing on a board-like surface in a surfing stance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the original wave formation preserved, with the surfer riding on top of it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original wave has been replaced by a much larger and more dynamic water scene involving a manta ray, and the surfer is riding the wave created by this creature. In Image A, the surfer is riding a normal ocean wave. Thus, the original wave formation is not preserved in Image B.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ocean waters around the wave consistent with their appearance in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The waters in Image B appear more dynamic, with splashes and interaction with the manta ray, creating a fantastical setting. In Image A, the ocean waters are relatively calm except where the surfer is. Hence, the waters around the wave do not appear consistent with their appearance in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, a clear sky and horizon line are visible. Image B maintains a clear sky with some added artistic light and effects, but the essential elements of the clear sky and horizon from Image A are retained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfer is wearing black swim shorts and is shirtless, identical to his appearance in Image A. The attire and absence of a shirt are consistent in both images, indicating that this aspect has been retained.",
