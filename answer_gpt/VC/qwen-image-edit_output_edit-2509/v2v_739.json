    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes almond-shaped with a downward gaze, maintaining their original proportion and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face is blurred, but the chibi style usually implies exaggerated proportions, which suggests that the facial features like eyes would typically be larger and distinct. However, given the blur, it's impossible to comment on their shape or gaze direction without making assumptions. Thus, no almond shape or specific gaze is discernible.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the nose present with a visible bridge and tip, positioned centrally between the eyes and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a chibi-style character whose facial features are obfuscated. In the chibi art style, noses are sometimes minimalistic or omitted entirely, thus making it impossible to determine if the nose is centrally positioned or has a defined bridge and tip.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the mouth have a subtle upward curve at the corners, forming a gentle smile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the facial blur in Image B, it is impossible to visually ascertain any details about the mouth such as its curvature or expression. In chibi art, expressions might be enhanced with exaggerated features, but the blur prevents any specific observation.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the subject seated cross-legged with knees bent and body leaning forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a stylized character standing in a traditional outfit. The pose is upright and not seated cross-legged, which contrasts with Image A where the person is indeed seated cross-legged with knees bent.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a small gold stud earring visible in the left ear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characterâ€™s ears are adorned with dangling gold earrings rather than a small stud. The styling is more ornamental, reflecting a theme consistent with elaborate chibi or cultural art styles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the skin tone light to medium with natural undertones, consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given the chibi art style in Image B, the skin tone appears uniform and may not reflect realistic or natural undertones. The style may use a singular color palette that might not match the more natural look of Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the head tilted downward with the gaze directed forward and slightly down?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the character is standing upright with the head forward, not tilted downward. The chibi-style character's orientation is more frontal and ceremonial rather than showing any specific tilting.",
