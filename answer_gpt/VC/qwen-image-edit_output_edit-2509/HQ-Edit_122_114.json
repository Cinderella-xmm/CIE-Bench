      "question": "Is the window located at the top center of the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the window is positioned near the top center of the house. This can be determined by observing its placement in relation to the A-frame roof, where it is situated directly under the peak. Typically, in such house designs, the window serves as a central decorative or functional feature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the chimney positioned on the left side of the roof?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chimney is indeed positioned on the left side of the roof. This can be observed from its visual placement on the left side when facing the house head-on, making it clear that it's on the left of the roof.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the house have an A-frame roof with a pointed peak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The house in Image B has a clear A-frame design, with the steeply angled roof forming a triangular shape and culminating at a pointed peak, which is characteristic of an A-frame structure.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a large circular opening in the front of the house where the nest is located?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, rather than a circular opening for a nest, there is a large circular element formed by gears surrounding the stork, which is distinct from the natural nest structure in Image A. The gear arrangement takes the place of a nest but still occupies a similar central position.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the stork located inside the nest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stork is integrated into a mechanical structure instead of a nest. The presence of gears replaces the natural nest seen in Image A, indicating that the stork is not inside a traditional nest.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there yellow flowers and a path visible in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground shows green grass, with some small yellow flowers peppered throughout, but there is no clear path visible. The setting still retains an element of nature with the grass and flowers.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are green trees and a textured sky visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes green trees and a sky with a textured appearance. This is similar to Image A, indicating consistency in the environmental backdrop.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
