      "question": "Does the image retain the metallic texture and finish of the bearings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bearings continue to showcase a metallic texture and finish, evident through the shiny, reflective surfaces typical of metal components. This representation closely matches the common characteristics associated with bearings. In contrast, Image A also portrays bearings with a metallic sheen, thus confirming that Image B retains this quality effectively.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the shape and structural details (rings, grooves) of the bearings accurately represented?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows bearings characterized by rings and grooves similar to standard roller bearings. They feature circular shapes and appear to maintain the design details. When comparing with Image A, the structural details such as rings and grooves seem accurately preserved in Image B, suggesting a faithful representation of bearing construction.",

      "question": "Do the bearings maintain their relative positions and orientations as shown in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bearings are arranged differently from the original Image A, where the bearings were separate rather than contained within a box. The bearings in Image B are organized within a container, suggesting a change in their relative positions and orientations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text shown is different, stating 'Wortneo Van'r Filar Riei Bkorre ocrve.ld'. This indicates a change from the text 'Facts You Need to Know about Bearings and Final Drive Motors' present in Image A, leading to an absence of the original phrase in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a clean and simple background, primarily consisting of a smooth gradient, which helps focus attention on the bearings. This is similar to Image A, where the background also plays a minimalistic role, facilitating the concentration on the subject more naturally.",
