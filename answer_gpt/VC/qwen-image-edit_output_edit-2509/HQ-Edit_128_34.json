      "question": "Is the McLaren logo clearly visible on the center of the car's hood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car is placed inside a transparent cube with a miniaturized cityscape model, and due to its scale or the reflective properties of the glass, the hood's details, including any logos, are not distinctly visible from this perspective. In Image A, the car's hood features a visible logo, suggesting a different viewing angle or resolution can highlight these details.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the headlights shaped in a narrow, curved, and horizontally elongated design with internal LED strips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car within the cube shows headlights that appear to be narrow and curved, fitting the description provided. This design is consistent with the typical styling of high-performance sports cars that employ LED strips for illumination within the headlights.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the brake calipers behind the front wheels colored bright orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B directly, the specific detailing of the brake calipers is not visible due to the scale and the angle within the cube. In Image A, the brake caliper color can be observed as possibly bright orange, reinforcing their prominence in automotive design for sports cars and suggesting the image intends to portray that. However, in Image B visibility issues make it impossible to confirm.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the tree leaves display a vibrant, natural green color without significant discoloration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature trees appear to maintain a vibrant, natural green color that effectively contrasts against the dark background. This observation is straightforward given the depiction of vegetation in a diorama or model setting, designed to simulate an idealized, lifelike color palette.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are white lane markings present on the asphalt road beneath the car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a clear model urban scene within a glass cube where the road beneath the miniature car includes white lane markings that stand out and contribute to the realistic portrayal of a street setting.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the car have a raised, sharply angled edge along the side above the wheel arches indicating dihedral door hinges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the model car within the transparent cube appears to have a conventional body design without the pronounced edge or hinge design described. The miniature scale likely leaves such aerodynamic and mechanical details obscured or simplified compared to an actual vehicle.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there at least two other cars visible in the background â€” one red and one yellow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the contents within the glass cube limit the number of visible cars due to scale. However, there appear to be at least two other mini cars besides the featured vehicle. Their colored details, if present, are obscured, unlike Image A where multiple cars are distinctly visible with identifiable colors including red and yellow.",
