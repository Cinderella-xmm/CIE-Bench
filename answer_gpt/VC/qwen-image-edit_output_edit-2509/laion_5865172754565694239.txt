    "Question": "Q1: Is the 'DUCATI' text in white lettering clearly visible along the down tube of the frame?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'DUCATI' is visible and prominently displayed in white lettering along the down tube of the bicycle frame. This is analogous to many brand labeling practices where the brand name is placed prominently on visible parts of the product. Therefore, in Image B, the characteristic 'DUCATI' text on the down tube is present.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the 'DUCATI' text in white lettering visible on the seat stay?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the 'DUCATI' text is not visible on the seat stay. The seat stay area is visible, and there isn't any lettering similar to the 'DUCATI' seen in the down tube region. Typically, in many bicycles, the branding might not necessarily be on the seat stay, and Image B follows this notion.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the word 'SPORT' in white lettering present on the top tube near the head tube?",
    "explanation": "By examining Image B, there is no 'SPORT' lettering visible near the top tube close to the head tube. The area above is modified with an illustrative character, and any initial text has been altered or removed to accommodate the new graphics.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the word 'TECH' in white lettering visible below the bottom bracket?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycle’s bottom bracket region where the 'TECH' text would usually be displayed does not visibly have this text. The space is either obscured or changed from its common branding practice, possibly due to the cartoon effect applied.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the main frame of the bicycle predominantly red in color?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the color of the bicycle frame has been noticeably modified; it is predominantly blue rather than red. This shift in color stands out as part of the illustrative and creative change made to the original image's frame.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the saddle and handlebars black in color?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, upon careful observation, both the saddle and handlebars are indeed black. This consistency with common bicycle styles is maintained even amid the cartoon-stylized edits elsewhere on the bike.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the chain visibly connecting the front crankset to the rear cassette?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chain is visibly connecting the front crankset to the rear cassette, which is necessary for the bicycle’s functionality depiction to remain consistent and correctly portrayed in a cartoon conversion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Do both tires have a silver reflective stripe along the sidewall?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels do not have a discernible silver reflective stripe visible on their sidewalls. The stylistic changes to the bicycle image have focused more on character addition rather than keeping technical aspects like reflective stripes consistent.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q9: Are the wheel hubs clearly visible at the center of both front and rear wheels?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, despite the cartoon editing applied, the wheel hubs remain visible at the center of both the front and rear wheels. This element remains logical in depicting a functional structure for the bicycle.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q10: Does the frame maintain a diamond-shaped structure with connected top, down, seat, and chain stays?",
    "explanation": "The inherent structure of the frame in Image B maintains the traditional diamond shape which comprises the top tube, down tube, seat tube, and stays. This foundational element remains unchanged to ensure the depiction of a proper bicycle structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
