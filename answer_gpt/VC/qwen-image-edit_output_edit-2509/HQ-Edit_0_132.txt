    "Question": "Q1: Are there exactly three human figures in the scene, positioned respectively in the foreground, on a small island in the lake, and on the far left bank?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are two human figures depicted interacting in the foreground, likely engaging in a Tai Chi demonstration. Counts show two people, not three.
