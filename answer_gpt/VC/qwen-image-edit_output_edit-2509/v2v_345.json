      "question": "Is the USB-C port located centrally on the bottom edge of the smartphone, flanked by two sets of three circular speaker holes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom edge of the smartphone clearly displays a USB-C port in the middle, surrounded by two sets of three circular speaker holes on either side, which is consistent with the design of many modern smartphones. This center alignment is a common feature, indicating functionality related to charging and sound output.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the smartphone placed diagonally on the wooden surface, with its bottom edge closer to the viewer than the top edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the smartphone as positioned on the wooden surface, with its bottom edge indeed closer to the viewer, creating a diagonal orientation. This is apparent from the perspective and angle at which the smartphone is displayed, where the bottom edge visibly leads nearer than the top, suggesting a diagonal placement.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the wooden surface display a consistent horizontal grain pattern with warm brown tones and visible wood fibers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a wooden surface with noticeable horizontal grain patterns, characterized by warm brown tones. The visibility of these grain patterns suggests the texture and natural appearance of wood, combining visual cues with an understanding of how wood fibers typically appear in photography.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background a uniform beige color with a soft blur effect, providing a shallow depth of field?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background that is uniform in color, specifically beige, without any distinct features or objects. Along with this, the image exhibits a soft blur effect, a common technique to enhance depth perception and focus on the main subjects by creating a shallow depth of field.",

      "question": "Is the mouse positioned to the left of the smartphone, with both objects resting on the same wooden surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the mouse situated on the smartphone itself, rather than to its left, suggesting that the mouse is placed directly on the smartphone's surface. Therefore, the description of the mouse being on the left is inaccurate, based on the visual details in the image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mouse is positioned directly on top of the smartphone, and its orientation is forward-facing, with its head turned away from the smartphone. This positioning indicates that the mouse is not facing or turned toward the smartphone, as it is placed looking outward instead.",
