      "question": "Are the wooden truss supports of the railway bridge clearly visible and structurally intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the railway bridge is visible, but instead of seeing the wooden truss supports, the bridge is stylized with neon lights and lines. The structural integrity of the wooden supports is not visible as they are replaced by futuristic designs. This indicates that the emphasis is on artistic representation rather than structural clarity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the river present and flowing continuously beneath the bridge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area beneath the bridge is stylized with neon elements rather than depicting a realistic river. The neon lines suggest some form of connectivity or flow but don't visually convey a continuous natural water body like a river. Thus, the river's presence in a traditional sense is absent.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the red-brick buildings with gabled roofs and chimneys visible in the park area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there are some buildings visible within the neon-lit landscape, they lack distinguishing features such as red-brick construction or specific architectural details like gabled roofs and chimneys. The visual representation is more about artistic neon forms than accurate architectural features.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the green lawns and paved pathways in the park area clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the park area with stylized neon visuals, which include neon outlines of trees and infrastructure. However, these bright neon lines do not depict realistic green lawns or paved pathways. Instead, they serve as artistic representations rather than clear physical features.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the city skyline located behind the river and bridge, maintaining the original depth order?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B showcase the city skyline behind the bridge, with Image B maintaining the depth order by placing the stylized skyscrapers in the background. The neon city maintains the familiar depth structure by positioning the buildings correctly in relation to the bridge.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are two parallel railroad tracks visible along the length of the bridge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the bridge indeed features two parallel railroad tracks. In Image B, while the bridge maintains its position, the depiction of railroad tracks is altered, with neon designs taking precedence. The neon arrangement does not clearly depict two distinct railroad tracks along the bridge's length.",
