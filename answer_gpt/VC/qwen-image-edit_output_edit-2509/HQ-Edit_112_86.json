      "question": "Is the large central rose still present and located at the center of the teapot's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we can observe a rose design prominently featured at the center of the teapot's body. This is identifiable through the detailed etching that resembles a rose. Combining this visual information with world knowledge about common teapot decoration, the presence of a large, central rose on the body affirms its traditional decorative role. Thus, the central rose is still present and centrally located.",

      "question": "Are the surrounding leaves and smaller flowers arranged symmetrically around the central rose in the same configuration as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of leaves and smaller flowers around the central rose shows symmetry, confirming knowledge of the usual pattern employed in floral teapot designs. Typically, symmetry is used to create aesthetically pleasing designs. Comparatively analyzing Image A, the floral pattern appears equally symmetrical in arrangement. Therefore, the configuration of surrounding leaves and smaller flowers maintains symmetry similar to the original.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the spout located on the left side, extending in a smooth, curved fashion typical of teapot designs that prioritize functional pouring mechanism while maintaining aesthetic value. This feature matches the description in Image A. Thus, the positioning and shaping remain consistent with the original.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handle in Image B is attached to the right side and exhibits an arched shape that resembles elegant teapot handle designs known for providing a comfortable grip while balancing the visual symmetry on both sides of the pot. Comparing to Image A, the handle's position and shape remain consistent with the original design, maintaining its functionality and aesthetic.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's a finial on top of the lid, maintaining a knob-like shape that serves both as a functional grip point and a decorative element. World knowledge about teapot lids often includes such designs for easy handling. Analyzing the Image A, the finial is similarly present, confirming that both the decorative and functional aspects remain unchanged.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a lid covering the teapot's top, maintaining the domed shape typical of lids for secure coverage and aesthetic appeal, represented by decorative detailing. Upon comparison with Image A, the lid structure and decorative band display consistency, maintaining both its original design and function.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a teapot with a rounded, bulbous body which naturally transitions smoothly between the base and upper parts. This shape is typical of traditional teapot designs, providing both capacity and aesthetic balance. Confirming through a comparative analysis with Image A, the rounded shape remains unchanged, supporting both functional capacity and continuity in design aesthetic.",
