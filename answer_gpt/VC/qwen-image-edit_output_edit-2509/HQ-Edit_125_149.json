    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the river present beneath the bridge, flowing from the background toward the foreground with visible white water over mossy rocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the river is indeed present and visible in the lower part of the image. It flows from the background towards the foreground, as indicated by the orientation of the water and the perspective. The water appears to be moving over mossy rocks, creating visible white water or small rapids, which is common in forest streams or small rivers. This visual information combined with the typical behavior of a river in a forest setting supports the conclusion that Image B has a river flowing as described.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there moss-covered rocks visible in the river, especially near the center and right side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the river is depicted with several rocks in the water, which appear to be covered with a green substance suggesting moss. These rocks are particularly noticeable near the center and right side of the frame, matching the description provided. This is consistent with the appearance of rocky forest streams where moss often grows due to the damp environment.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are multiple fallen logs visible along the left and right riverbanks, some partially submerged in the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, fallen logs are clearly visible along both the left and right sides of the riverbank. Several of these logs appear to be lying close to or in the water, which is a common occurrence in forested areas where trees can fall due to natural causes and are gradually integrated into the river landscape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a canopy of green leaves overhead, allowing dappled sunlight to filter down onto the bridge and river?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible canopy of green leaves present in the upper portion of the image. The lighting suggests dappled sunlight filtering through the leaves, illuminating parts of the area below, such as the river and the bridge. This is commonly seen in forest environments where the sun's rays penetrate through gaps in the foliage.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there several large, moss-covered tree trunks leaning toward the bridge from the left bank, with one prominently curving over the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not have the structure of a bridge; instead, there appears to be a large tree-like entity or creature in the center. However, there are still tree elements visible, notably a large tree or tree-like parts leaning inwards. It is different from the standard bridge structure, suggesting an artistic reinterpretation. Therefore, the configuration from Image A does not directly apply.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the image captured from a low-angle viewpoint, looking upward at the bridge from near the river level?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perspective appears to be from a low-angle viewpoint, looking upwards. This is evidenced by the way the tree-like figure is shown towering over the observer and the overall view of the surrounding environment. Although there isnâ€™t a traditional bridge, the called figure in the middle creates a similar vertical emphasis.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the bridge structure extend horizontally across the river, supported by towers on both sides, forming a continuous span?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the typical bridge structure extending horizontally across the river is not present. Instead, a large tree-like entity is prominent in the scene, replacing the bridge seen in Image A. The creature appears to have somewhat of a humanoid form, with no traditional structural elements like towers or spans bridging across the river.",
