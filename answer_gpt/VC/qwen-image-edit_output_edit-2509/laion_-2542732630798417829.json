      "question": "Is the glass bulb shaped like a teardrop with visible internal filaments present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bulb within the comic design is stylized to resemble a cartoonish light bulb character rather than a realistic teardrop shape. It features a face and body rather than the traditional structure with visible internal filaments as seen in a real Edison bulb. Therefore, the teardrop shape and visible internal filaments are not present in this depiction.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the curved vertical bars forming a cage-like structure around the bulb present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction includes a drawing in the last panel that suggests the presence of a caged light bulb, similar to Image A. The cartoon style emphasizes the cage-like elements by showing bold, curved vertical lines around what would logically be the bulb. Thus, even though it's in a stylized form, the elements reminiscent of a cage-like structure are still present.",

      "question": "Is the dark cylindrical housing at the top of the fixture with a visible screw detail present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon drawing of a light bulb fixture includes elements resembling the cylindrical housing, although it is simplified in comparison to Image A. While details like screws may not be explicitly drawn in a cartoon style, the essence of the cylindrical housing is depicted. Thus, the basic structure suggestive of such housing is present, but specific details like screws may not be visibly detailed.",

      "question": "Is the circular cap at the bottom of the metal cage present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a stylized representation of the bulb fixture in a comic panel. The cartoon imagery includes the overall shape of a bulb within a cage, but focuses more on the humor and story than precise mechanical details. Thus, while a general cage structure might be inferred, specific elements such as a circular cap at the bottom are not distinctly visible or emphasized in this representation.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the glass bulb positioned centrally within the metal cage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the comic style illustration shows the bulb character within a stylized cage framework. It is central to the comic panel's composition, humorously depicted to suggest the concept of a bulb within a light fixture. Although not to scale or in realistic detail, the bulb's position as the focal point within the suggested cage structure conveys its central placement.",
