      "question": "Is the pencil sharpener still present and serving its function in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pencil sharpener is visible on the table, and the hand is positioned in a way that suggests interaction with the sharpener, indicating it is still serving its function. World knowledge tells us that this type of sharpener requires a manual interaction to sharpen pencils, which aligns with the visual cues.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the three individuals still interacting in their respective roles (scribe, observer, attendant)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual cues such as the positioning and gestures of the individuals suggest interaction similar to roles such as scribe, observer, and attendant. Combining this with world knowledge of typical interactions in such contexts reinforces that these roles are still being portrayed.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the large windows still visible in the background of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a backdrop that appears flat and sculpted, making it difficult to discern any typical window features. Given this sculptural depiction, visual cues suggest the windows are not clearly visible or discerned as they were in conventional imagery.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there still scattered papers and pencils on the table in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible objects that resemble papers and pencils scattered on the table. While they are depicted in a sculptural manner, they retain enough identifiable features consistent with the appearance of such items, indicating their presence.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The relational positioning of individuals in Image B is preserved from Image A. While the details are translated into a sculptural form, the spatial arrangement and interaction remain consistent, aligning with knowledge of translating scenes into similar formats.",
