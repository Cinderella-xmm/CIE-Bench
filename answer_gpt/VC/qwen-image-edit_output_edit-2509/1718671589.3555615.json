    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the central dome present and positioned directly above the main structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central dome is clearly visible and centrally placed above the main cubic-shaped structure of the building, which is typical for dome architecture as it often signifies the roof or crown of a significant building. The symmetrical placement suggests structural balance.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a golden star located at the very top of the dome’s spire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon examining the dome's spire, no golden star is visible. The spire is topped with a small pointed structure, but it lacks any star ornamentation.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the windows arranged in a symmetrical grid pattern across the building’s front face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the windows are arranged in a neat, orderly pattern that is consistent and repetitive across the face of the building, indicating a symmetrical grid pattern, which adds to the balanced architectural design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a row of vertical columns forming a portico at the ground level of the building’s front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no vertical columns at the ground level of the building's front. The structure's front features details resembling windows and door frames, but there is no portico formed by columns.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there two large trees with golden-yellow foliage positioned symmetrically on both sides of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are trees with a similar golden-brownish hue placed near the building, but their placement isn't perfectly symmetrical. Furthermore, they appear stylized rather than realistic, typical for the gingerbread theme.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a straight paved road running in front of the building, parallel to its base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there isn't any indication of a paved road in front of the building. The base of the structure is shown to rest upon a square platform typical of gingerbread presentations, rather than any street-like pavement.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the building have a square base with rounded corners on the upper levels before transitioning into the dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building is structured with a distinct square base, and as it rises towards the dome, the design remains angular without transitioning into rounded corners before the dome, which itself retains a rounded contour.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
