        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl's face is blurred, making it impossible to see her mouth or any features like red lips or rosy cheeks. Therefore, we cannot confirm whether her mouth is open or any facial features.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl's body is facing forward rather than presenting a full side profile. Her head appears slightly tilted upwards, but because of the universal view change, she isn't strictly shown in a side profile.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
