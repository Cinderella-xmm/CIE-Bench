        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is shown with his back towards the viewer, indicating he is moving away down the street. This conclusion is drawn from the orientation of the man facing toward the background. Common perspectives of streets and the alignment of his posture also support this deduction.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the man holding a brown briefcase in his right hand, which is apparent from the visible handle and leather-like texture of the object being held. The depiction of the hand's position and the briefcaseâ€™s handle signifies that he is indeed holding it.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The man in Image B is illustrated wearing a blue jacket with visible stitching and texture commonly associated with denim fabric. This is determined from the fabric appearance, the color, and style that matches typical denim outerwear.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a street with a detailed pathway that resembles cobblestones, characterized by its textured and block-patterned surface. Alongside, the image visually provides buildings located on both sides of the roadway, which is deduced from their structured placement parallel to the path.",
