      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the curved, tapering silhouette of the central golden skyscraper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bookmark representing the central golden skyscraper in the edited image shows a curved shape that is reminiscent of the building's silhouette in Image A. The bookmark includes a curved top that mirrors the tapering design seen in the skyscraper. This silhouette is reflected in the bookmark's design, which conforms closely to the tapering architecture of the tower in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the sharp, asymmetrical top of the leftmost skyscraper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bookmark that represents the leftmost skyscraper in the edited image features a pointy and sharp top similar to the original building's asymmetrical design visible in Image A, where the top sharply cuts in one direction, distinguishing its silhouette.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the stepped, rectangular form of the building next to the central tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bookmark in the edited image shows a linear, stepped design with distinct horizontal lines, reflecting the rectangular, stepped architecture of the building adjacent to the central skyscraper in Image A. The form exhibits these characteristics in both scenarios.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the vertical light strip pattern on the right-side skyscraper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the bookmark for the right-side skyscraper in the edited image, the vertical lines capture a striped detail reminiscent of light strips along the height of the building seen in Image A, indicating a retention of this design element.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the bookmark preserve the height-to-width ratio and tapering proportion of the central skyscraper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bookmark representing the central skyscraper maintains a slim, elongated form similar to the original building's height-to-width ratio observed in Image A, with the tapering visible at the top, preserving this proportion.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the wider base of the central skyscraper compared to its upper section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bookmark shows an unmodified tapering outline, where the base does not appear wider but is similarly tapered up to the top, which diverges from Image A where the base has a wider proportion. Therefore, the characteristic of a wider base is not preserved in the bookmark.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the red buoy present in the final image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not feature any significant water body or buoy representation; it focuses solely on sketches and bookmarks resembling skyscrapers on a notebook. The red buoy seen in Image A is absent in Image B.",
