    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the lid of the piano open and angled upward, revealing the internal structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the piano lid is indeed open and angled upward, as evidenced by the visible inside of the lid and the angled structure suggesting it is propped open. This is a common feature in grand pianos to project sound, and the gingerbread design illustrates this aspect, despite being purely decorative.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the piano have four legs, each ending in a golden caster, supporting the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gingerbread piano does have four legs; however, the ends of the legs are not golden casters but rather decorated with gingerbread designs that mimic the texture of baking or frosting. The lack of metallic elements or distinct caster shapes confirms this.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there exactly three pedals positioned in a row beneath the keyboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gingerbread piano in Image B is shown with a detailed design below the keyboard resembling pedals, though their gingerbread and icing structure is more decorative. Based on the image, a close inspection reveals multiple elements that look like pedals.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the keys arranged in the standard piano pattern of alternating white and black keys across the full length of the keyboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the gingerbread piano keys entirely made of frosting or icing, lacking the standard pattern of alternating black and white keys. The design appears more as a continuous decorative feature without functional piano key differentiation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a music stand attached to the top front edge of the piano body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the piano features a component at the front top resembling a music stand, though it is crafted in a gingerbread style with decorative icing. This indicates the presence of a stand, albeit of a decorative kind compared to the functional one in the original image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the lid connected to the piano body via a visible hinge mechanism near the rear edge of the keyboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the gingerbread piano does not reveal a visible hinge mechanism as seen in traditional pianos. The connection appears stylized and formed from icing or decoration, indicating a lack of functional hinges.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the piano maintain the same elongated, curved-body silhouette and proportional dimensions as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a gingerbread piano with a similar elongated and curved-body silhouette as Image A. The proportions are consistent with grand piano designs, though realized in a stylized, decorative form, maintaining the general shape.",
