      "question": "Are the intricate floral and vine motifs present in their original pattern and spatial arrangement across the body and lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the intricate floral and vine motifs continue to adorn the body of the teapot. These motifs are detailed and have a three-dimensional appearance, similar to those found on an ornamental teapot. The patterns are typical of decorative teapots with historical or artistic designs, suggesting a continuity of original design elements. A comparison with Image A shows that the floral motifs on the lid and body remain intricate, but might not match the exact spatial arrangement of the original image due to structural differences.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central chamber appears in a reddish color that is similar to the original teapot's color.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a teapot handle that is elegantly curved and clearly visible. The handle supports both functionality and design aesthetics typical of teapots from periods of decorative artistry. Comparing to Image A, the handle in Image B has a similar location and visibility, retaining an elegant curve, which suggests consistency with the original contour.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot spout maintains a graceful curve with a slight elongation. This design is typical of traditional teapots aimed at maximizing pour effectiveness and adding to visual aesthetics. A comparison with Image A suggests that the spout's characteristic curve and elongated form are indeed preserved, indicating no significant alteration in its shape.",

      "question": "Is the base structure, including its decorative silver band, preserved in form and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base structure is more cylindrical, possibly due to the depiction of the teapot as a candle. The decorative elements around the base do not reflect the ornate metallic detailing seen in Image A, where the base features intricate silver detailing. This indicates a change in both the base's form and decorative approach.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B’s teapot displays ornate designs with raised textures, giving the impression of embossed metal work. The details appear to be carved or sculpted to stand out from the body of the teapot, maintaining a three-dimensional appearance akin to metal embossing. This is consistent with Image A’s raised and detailed metallic textures, maintaining a high level of craftsmanship.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot maintains a rounded, bulbous shape, which is common in both functional and decorative teapot designs, allowing for optimal heat circulation and aesthetic appeal. When compared to Image A, the body shape remains visually similar, suggesting a consistent form with the original teapot design.",
