      "question": "Is the cat depicted in a curled-up position with one paw visibly stretched out?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is illustrated in a curled-up position, typical of how cats rest. This position inherently does not feature any visibly stretched-out paw as the limbs are tucked into the curled body. Observing this image confirms the curled-up nature without any paw stretching, combining this visual cue with the typical resting position of cats aids the assessment.",

      "question": "Is the cat shown lying on a curved surface representing the car's hood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is depicted lying on a surface that can be assumed to represent the hood of a car based on its shape and placement. The art style simplifies the depiction of a car hood to a somewhat curved, flat area where the cat is positioned, suggesting a realistic scenario of a cat lying on a car hood.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there reflection lines present on the curved surface under the cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes reflection lines drawn on the surface of the car hood where the cat is lying. These lines commonly illustrate light reflections seen on car hoods, creating the impression of a glossy and curved surface. This depiction uses common visual cues from simplified or stylized representations where reflection is suggested by line patterns.",

      "question": "Is the entire sticker image surrounded by a thick white outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B reveals that the entire depiction is bordered by a thick white outline, typical of sticker design where this outline accentuates or defines the boundary of the cutout image for easy application and clear distinction from other surfaces.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the sticker have a transparent background behind the outlined image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the space around the outlined image appears in a white area which typically signifies the presence of a transparent background in sticker designs. The thick white border forms the silhouette of the sticker indicating the see-through nature around it once applied, beyond the central graphical content, especially when the background merges into the outline design.",
