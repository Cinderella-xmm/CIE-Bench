    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the blade visibly curved in the same manner as in the original image, extending from the guard to a pointed tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blade is indeed visibly curved, extending from the guard towards a pointed tip, consistent with the shape in Image A. The curvature is similar, though the texture and material differ as Image B features a softer, plush appearance which does not alter the curvature comparison with Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the hilt retain the segmented, block-like pattern along its length, similar to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hilt does not have the segmented, block-like pattern seen in Image A. Instead, it presents a smooth, uniform texture indicative of a plush or soft material, unlike the segmented look of the original dagger's handle.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the guard decorated with intricate floral and geometric patterns, matching the original design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's guard does not feature any intricate floral or geometric patterns. It appears smooth and plain, likely due to the plush material, unlike Image A where the guard is heavily decorated with such designs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the blade covered with a dense black filigree pattern, matching the original in layout and coverage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's blade does have some form of pattern, but it is not dense black filigree like Image A's. The pattern in Image B is more simplistic and stylized and does not match the intricate layout and coverage of the original.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the proportions between the hilt, guard, and blade preserved, with the blade being longer than the hilt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions seem to be preserved with the blade being longer than the hilt. This consistent proportion is maintained even though the materials and details have changed from metal and ivory to a plush-like material.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the blade end in a pointed tip, consistent with the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blade does indeed end in a pointed tip similarly to Image A, although it is rendered in a soft, plush form. The alteration in material does not affect the sharpness of curvature towards the tip of the blade.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the dagger positioned diagonally across the frame, from upper left to lower right, as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dagger positioned diagonally across the frame from upper left to lower right similar to Image A, maintaining consistency in the orientation of the object within the frame.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
