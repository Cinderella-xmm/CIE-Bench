    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are distinct horizontal sedimentary layers visible in the rock face of the cliff?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rock face appears textured but is primarily covered by the elements of the giant figure, making distinct sedimentary layers difficult to discern. Given the fantasy nature of the figure, the geology is not real, so horizontal sedimentary layers, typical of natural rock formations, are not visible in this depiction.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a bright, linear reflection of the sun visible on the water surface extending from the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a surreal scene with the giant creature, but the artistic rendering of the reflection on the water closely resembles real-world physics with the bright sun and subsequent reflection extending vertically across the water. This element matches natural phenomena.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there multiple small boats visible on the water surface in the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fantastical representation does not include any small boats visible on the water surface. The focus is on the giant and the surrounding magical elements, and thus, small boats are omitted in this imagery.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are shrubs and small trees growing along the upper edges and crevices of the cliff?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B decorates the giant with trees and moss, which indicates a blending of nature with fantasy. However, these elements are not positioned along the cliff but are part of the figure itself, contrasting the usual placement of shrubs along a cliffside.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are large, irregular boulders and grassy patches present in the foreground near the cliff edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cliff edge in Image B is mostly occluded by the giant figure. The fantasy elements take precedence, making the typical features like boulders and grassy patches in the foreground hard to identify or nonexistent.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the sun located low on the horizon, emitting a warm golden glow across the sky and water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the sun positioned low on the horizon with a warm glow across the environment, resembling typical sunset lighting that enhances the fantastical ambiance of the scene.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the cliff edge form a steep, continuous drop-off directly into the water below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cliff is obscured by the giant figure, and thus, the drop-off is not clearly defined. The surreal representation does not capture the continuous drop-off typical of natural cliffs into the water.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
