      "question": "Is the white tea light candle present on the black surface to the left of the bonsai pot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is a tree-like figure with an elaborate design, standing on a decorative platform. The visual elements, such as the wings and the embellished base, differ from the elements in a bonsai setting, such as a candle or a pot. The edited image does not feature a bonsai pot or any candle on a black surface. It showcases a different artistic subject without these elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the bonsai and candle resting on a flat black surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main subject is a tree-like figure, which is placed on an intricate stone-like platform rather than a flat black surface. The surface in this image has decorative patterns and supports a different subject entirely, indicating no association with a bonsai or a candle resting on it.",

      "question": "Is the background uniformly light gray with no visible patterns or objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a light neutral color without any visible patterns or objects, matching the description of a uniformly colored background. This maintains consistency and ensures the focus remains on the central figure.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bonsai planted in a wide, shallow, teal-colored ceramic pot that occupies the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a central subject that is a tree-like figure with a decorative aesthetic, rather than a bonsai in a ceramic pot. The figure is positioned on a decorative base, and there is no teal-colored pot visible. This indicates a significant change from Image A, which had detailed elements of a bonsai setup.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are dark soil and exposed root matter visible at the surface of the pot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depicted object is an artful tree-like figure standing on an elaborate base, without visible soil or root matter. The absence of a pot eliminates any visible soil or root details, differing from common bonsai presentations that often expose these features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the bonsai positioned centrally and upright in the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, presents a central upright figure that is a stylized tree-like entity with colorful wings on an ornamental platform. While the positioning is central, this does not resemble a bonsai in form or presentation, as it's an artistic representation rather than a real plant.",
