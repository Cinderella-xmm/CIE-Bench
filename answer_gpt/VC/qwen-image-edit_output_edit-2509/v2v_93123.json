        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly man's hair appears white, which is a common characteristic for older individuals. The presence of such hair can be inferred from the light color visible around the head area. However, the mustache isn't visible in the provided image in the head region due to the face being blurred.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pineapple in Image B has noticeable spiky green leaves at its top, which is characteristic of pineapples. Additionally, the textured skin, which is golden-brown, suggests the pineapple's typical appearance. These features are visible and identifiable from Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B seems to show the man's head oriented towards the pineapple, as suggested by the alignment of his body and head even though the face is blurred. This orientation gives the impression that he is likely gazing or contemplating towards the pineapple.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses warm lighting and shadows that are visible on both the elderly man and the pineapple. These lighting conditions are evident from the overall warm, golden tone of the image and how the shadows are cast, particularly highlighting the texture on the pineapple and clothing of the man.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spatial arrangement shows the pineapple positioned to the right of the elderly man. This spatial relationship mirrors common compositional structures where objects are placed next to one another to create a balanced visual arrangement.",
