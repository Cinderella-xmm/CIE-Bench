      "question": "Is the statue’s right hand raised in a gesture with fingers extended upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue's right hand is clearly raised with the fingers extended upward, which is consistent with gestures often seen in statues to express a specific intent or sign. This observation is drawn from the visible pose of the statue's hand.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Even though the face of the statue in Image B is blurred, the hair appears to be styled in a manner that could suggest long hair. Without specific visibility, definitive identification of a beard is difficult; however, the styling is suggestive of traditional sculptures depicted with long hair and beards.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pedestal includes intricate designs and a plaque, but there is no visible inscription of the year “1882” on the front face of the pedestal. The details provided on the base do not include numerical engravings that could represent a year.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a statue carefully positioned on the pedestal. The glass enclosure suggests cautious handling, and it is typical for statues to be aligned vertically on pedestals for stability and visual symmetry, indicating it is aligned and directly on top.",
