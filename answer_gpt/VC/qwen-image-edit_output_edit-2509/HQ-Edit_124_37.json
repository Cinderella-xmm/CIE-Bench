    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the subject's skin tone still dark brown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject depicted is an angelic figure that generally does not have visible skin tones detailed due to the nature of the imagery, which traditionally uses lighter skin tones or avoids showing much skin beyond facial features. Given this context and the fact that the entire body is covered except the face, we conclude that there is no clear skin tone shown in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the subjectâ€™s head tilted upward with her gaze directed toward the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is depicted in a position that suggests a heavenly or ethereal stance, often illustrated with a head held straight or slightly downturned, as traditional artistic representations of such figures imply a serene pose rather than one of looking upward. From the pose depicted in the image, it seems the head is not tilted upward.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are both arms extended outward with hands open and palms facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's arms are bent at the elbows, with hands holding the edges of the garment, which suggests a pose of presentation or offering rather than an extended position with palms open and facing forward.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the subject have braided hair, even if stylized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays an angelic figure with a more traditional depiction of flowing hair rather than braided. Classical and stylized depictions of angels often have hair that is loose and wavy, indicating elegance and fluidity.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lower portion of the garment flaring outward, suggesting motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a garment that seems to billow out, a common artistic choice for depicting movement or an ethereal floating sensation in angelic imagery. This gives the impression that the garment, although still, is flowing as if in motion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the subject smiling with visible teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face details are not clearly visible due to the blur applied, but traditional angelic representations typically portray serene, closed-lip expressions rather than open smiles displaying teeth. Hence, it's reasonable to assume the absence of a visible smile with teeth.",
