      "question": "Is the black bat with outstretched wings inside a red circle present on the label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the label contains a circular logo at the top, similar in position to where a bat logo would typically be. However, the logo on this LEGO reconstruction is not detailed in color or specific shape like in typical printed labels. Given the LEGO construction, exact replication in detail is challenging, but the logo's general form suggests an attempt to mimic the original, yet is not discernibly a 'black bat inside a red circle' from visual inspection.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the word \"BACARDÍ\" displayed in bold black serif font above the word \"MOJITO\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'BACARDÍ' is visible on the LEGO label. While it is displayed with raised lettering that simulates boldness, the font is represented using LEGO bricks which cannot faithfully recreate the serif aspect typically associated with this typeface. It resembles a bold font but lacks the precise serif style due to the limitations of LEGO bricks.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the word \"MOJITO\" written in green sans-serif font below \"BACARDÍ\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the word 'MOJITO' on the label below 'BACARDÍ'. While the font appears sans-serif due to the simplicity of LEGO construction, the specific green color is not distinctly visible as it does not appear due to the multicolor of the LEGO pieces.",
      "weight": 3,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the signature \"Facundo Bacardí\" in cursive script present below the product name?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B indicates that exact replication of cursive script such as 'Facundo Bacardí' is not feasible given the method of construction with LEGO bricks. Therefore, no cursive script is distinguishable below the product name.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is a mint leaf icon visible near the bottom of the label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the abstract nature of LEGO art, smaller graphical elements like a mint leaf icon do not appear as they would in a detailed, printed label. Such intricate details are likely omitted in the change to a LEGO format.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the words \"natural mint flavor, lime juice, cane sugar\" visible on the lower part of the label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B replaces fine text with abstract detail due to the nature of LEGO design. As such, detailed phrases, such as 'natural mint flavor, lime juice, cane sugar', common on a detailed printed label, are not present in the LEGO reconstruction.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the phrase \"Simply pour over ice\" present on the label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given the LEGO format of Image B, where intricate text details are usually substituted for a more blocky, simplistic representation, smaller detailed text like the phrase 'Simply pour over ice' is not visible or discernible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the text \"15% ALC. BY VOL.\" visible on the label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, reconstructed in LEGO, does not feature small text elements such as '15% ALC. BY VOL.'. Such technical details are typically represented by real text and are not captured in the LEGO medium.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a bottle form made from LEGO bricks that incorporates a semblance of curvature to mimic the original bottle's shape with a curved body and narrowing at the neck. It captures the silhouette reasonably closely using straight, blocky LEGO bricks.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cap of the LEGO bottle appears to be represented with stacked round LEGO bricks, giving it a cylindrical appearance that aligns with the concept of a typical bottle cap shape.",
