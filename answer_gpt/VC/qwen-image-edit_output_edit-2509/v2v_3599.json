      "question": "Is the wall behind the objects still light blue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall behind the objects appears to be the same in color as in Image A, which is light blue. The visual information in Image B shows a consistent color and tone as seen in Image A, indicating no change in the wall's color. This conclusion is drawn based on the unaltered backdrop that serves as a neutral setting for the objects displayed.",

      "question": "Does the white crib with vertical bars and a curved headboard remain in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crib with vertical bars and a curved headboard is still present. This is indicated by the visual depiction of the crib remaining unchanged in terms of structure and design compared to Image A. Common sense suggests that the similarity in the design cues—such as the curved headboard and vertical bars—demonstrates the crib remains in the same position as the original image.",

      "question": "Is the crib mattress still patterned with yellow and gray cloud designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the crib mattress retains its pattern featuring yellow and gray cloud designs. This visual detail is preserved, demonstrating continuity from Image A to Image B. As no alteration in the mattress design is evident, it is reasonable to conclude that the pattern has been maintained.",

      "question": "Are the new figures (medieval knights) still positioned along the wall near the crib, maintaining their relative alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The new figures (medieval knights) in Image B are positioned along the wall near the crib, similar to the original positioning of the stuffed animals in Image A. The alignment—three figures in proximity to each other and near the crib—is consistent across both images. This spatial arrangement confirms their unchanged placement between the two images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the floor with a beige carpet, matching the original depiction in Image A. The unchanged floor color and texture reflect the unmodified setting, emphasizing the consistency between both images regarding the flooring material and appearance.",
