      "question": "Are the three sheep positioned near each other, with one adult sheep interacting closely with the two younger ones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are three chibi sheep standing next to each other. They appear to be of similar size, with no significant distinction in their position or interaction indicating that one is adult or the others are younger sheep. Thus, based on the visual cues, they seem to be positioned equally rather than showing a specific close interaction among a distinct adult and younger sheep.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the chibi sheep maintain their original postures, with the adult sheep standing upright and the younger ones leaning towards it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi sheep are all standing upright in a similar posture, aligned in a straight row. There is no visual indication of one being distinctively adult or others leaning towards it in a way described in the question. Thus, they appear to have uniform postures.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the chibi sheep retain identifiable sheep-like body proportions, such as a rounded body and small legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi sheep in Image B are designed with a rounded body and small legs, which are common simplified representations in chibi style for conveying the essence of sheep. This maintains sheep-like body proportions in an abstract way.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible interaction displayed between the adult chibi sheep and the two younger ones, suggesting care or attention?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no apparent differentiation between adult and younger chibi sheep, nor any depicted interaction that suggests care or attention among them. They appear to be equally standing beside each other without any interactive gestures.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the chibi sheep retain a representation of their woolly texture, even in a stylized or simplified manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi sheep in Image B have their wool represented in a stylized form with the outlines depicting a fluffy, cloud-like texture around their bodies and heads. This visual cue suggests a simplified manner of representing wool, aligning with the chibi art style.",
