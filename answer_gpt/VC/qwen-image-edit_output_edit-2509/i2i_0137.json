      "question": "Are the two white armchairs with orange cushions still present in the same location as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two white armchairs with orange cushions are positioned directly in front of a large window and are placed on a beige rug. This setup suggests a seating area designed for comfort and conversation. Without referring to Image A yet, we can infer this is a well-thought-out arrangement typical in cozy living spaces. Now, looking at Image A, we notice the two white armchairs with orange cushions in the same location, indicating no change in their positioning. The reasoning involves recognizing familiar living room settings where furniture arrangements are generally consistent unless specified otherwise.",

      "question": "Is the small round wooden table still present between the two armchairs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a small round wooden table located between the two armchairs. This type of configuration is common in living rooms for placing decorative items or essentials. Without needing more reference for common practice, it can be deduced from the image elements alone. In Image A, the same wooden table is visible in the same location, indicating its presence remains unchanged. The comparison highlights an unchanged element meant for utility and style in a typical seating arrangement.",

      "question": "Is the large window framed by beige curtains still in the same position as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a large window framed by beige curtains, indicative of design choices that favor natural light and a homely atmosphere in room layouts. Recognizing these aspects as common in many living spaces, we consider the placement consistent with expectations. Upon reviewing Image A, we see the window framed with the same curtains in a matching position, confirming no alterations. This analysis uses predictable spatial order in interior designs, particularly concerning static elements like windows.",

      "question": "Is the tall indoor plant in a woven basket still located to the right of the window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the large indoor plant is visibly situated in a woven basket to the right of the window. Such placements aim to add greenery and warmth to indoor environments, fitting into the common logic of augmenting a room's atmosphere. By checking Image A, the plant remains in the identical location alongside other unchanged elements. The comparison indicates a stable design choice for the room's visual and environmental appeal.",

      "question": "Is the beige rug covering the wooden floor still present under the furniture arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seating area with the armchairs and table is situated on a beige rug, suggesting an intention to delineate space while offering comfort against the wooden floor. Such setups are typical in designed living areas to complement the warmth and aesthetics of the room. Inspecting Image A shows the rug in the same setup under the furniture, hinting at continuity in decorative choices. The logical reasoning here involves recognizing the functional aspect of rugs alongside their decorative role.",
