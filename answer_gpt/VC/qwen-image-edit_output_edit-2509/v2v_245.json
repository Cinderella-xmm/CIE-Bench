      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the two jet engines mounted under the wings of the airplane present and correctly positioned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the airplane is fitted with two jet engines below its wings. This setup mirrors conventional design standards for commercial aircraft, where engines are positioned underneath the wings to optimize aerodynamics and engine functionality.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the continuous row of oval-shaped passenger windows visible along the side of the fuselage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an airplane with a clearly visible series of oval-shaped passenger windows along the side of the fuselage. This is typical of commercial aircraft, which generally have multiple windows in rows for passenger viewing.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the rounded nose cone with the three-part cockpit window configuration present at the front of the airplane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the airplane features a rounded nose cone with a cockpit window array consisting of three panels in a linear arrangement. This configuration is a common design feature in commercial airplane construction.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tall vertical stabilizer (tail fin) present at the rear of the airplane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the rear portion of the airplane with a tall vertical stabilizer, or tail fin. This component is crucial for maintaining lateral stability and direction control during flight.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the landing gear assemblies with multiple wheels visible beneath the fuselage and wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any landing gear assemblies with multiple wheels beneath the fuselage or wings. Typically, these are visible when the aircraft is on the ground for taxiing and parking operations.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the airplane with its main wing structure extending from the fuselage and the engines situated beneath the wings, which aligns with the common wing-engine configuration present in commercial aircraft designs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the airplane's cockpit windows are configured in a horizontal arrangement consisting of three sections. This is in line with standard cockpit window layouts found in commercial jets.",
