      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cap design and position resemble the original cap, as inferred from its similar style and orientation on the head. The cap maintains a classic flat cap style with the brim extended forward, similar to Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not visibly show a small brown leather tag on the side of the cap. The artistic depiction in the edited image lacks fine detail that would allow the leather tag to stand out.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clothing depicted retains a similar color scheme and neckline as the original shirt in Image A. The artwork portrays a shirt that appears to be in a similar style and color, signifying a heather gray crew-neck t-shirt.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, facial hair details such as a mustache or goatee cannot be discerned due to the blurred area. Thus, no additional facial features are visible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's body orientation and angle suggest he is in a side profile, turned towards the left, consistent with Image A. This is evident from the visibility of the ear and the profile view of the cap.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, being an illustrative adaptation, maintains the overall gray-toned theme of the cap and shirt, implying a heather gray appearance similar to Image A. However, the precise texture details typical of heather gray fabric, like the small contrasting fibers, are not clearly visible in this artwork.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the cap sitting naturally on the man's head, aligned with the contours of his skull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cap appears to sit naturally on the head, following the natural silhouette and flow seen in typical illustrations. This provides the impression that it is aligned correctly on the skull, as it does in Image A.",
