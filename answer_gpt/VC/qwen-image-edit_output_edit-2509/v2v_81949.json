      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is depicted holding a long brush over his shoulder, which is a typical representation of a chimney sweep.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chimney sweep is shown with a coiled hose slung across his back.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a brick chimney to the left of the figure, which remains a central aspect of the composition. This is a common element associated with chimney sweeps.
