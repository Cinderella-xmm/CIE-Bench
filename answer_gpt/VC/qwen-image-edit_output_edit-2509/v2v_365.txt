    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the alternating tan and dark brown pattern on the turtle's shell?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi turtle character has a shell that clearly resembles the tan and dark brown pattern seen on typical turtles, which includes the use of shading and texture. The shell's pattern, although stylized, retains the alternating tan and dark brown pattern reminiscent of a natural turtle shell. This reflects a designer's ability to capture the essence of the pattern in a stylized form.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the edited image retain the turtle's limb structure, even if the limbs are stylized?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a cartoonish, anthropomorphic turtle where the limbs are visible and have a structure reflective of turtle limbs. Although stylized to fit the cartoon's aesthetic, the limbs are positioned similarly to how a turtle's would be while walking, thus retaining its structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the edited image retain the textured appearance of the turtle's shell?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, while the turtle's shell does have some patterning, it lacks the complex texture seen in a real turtle shell. Instead, the shell in Image B relies on smooth, simplified cartoon aesthetics. Given these distinctions, the texture is not faithfully retained.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the edited image retain the turtle's head structure, including its visible eyes?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a chibi turtle with a head featuring eyes that are clearly visible, similar to a turtle's typical head structure. The stylization does not compromise the visual representation of the turtle's typical head anatomy, particularly the prominently displayed eyes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the edited image retain the textured appearance of the turtle's limbs?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the turtle's limbs are stylized to fit a cartoon aesthetic with smoother surfaces. Is common for stylized depictions of animals to lose realistic textures in favor of a simplified appearance. Consequently, the textured appearance of the limbs seen in a real turtle is not retained.",
    "answer": "No"
