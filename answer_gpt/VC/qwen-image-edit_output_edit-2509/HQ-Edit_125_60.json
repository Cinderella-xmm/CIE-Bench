      "question": "Is the shallow wooden tray beneath the tagine present and retaining its original shape, material, and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shape of the tagine has been replaced by a genie lamp, eliminating the tagine's tray entirely. Originally, in Image A, a wooden tray supported the tagine, consistent with the shape, material, and position typical for tagines. The absence of the tray in Image B indicates a change in both object and position.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass bottle filled with what appears to be olive oil and topped with a cork is visible, positioned on a small pedestal. This reflects the original composition seen in Image A, where the glass oil bottle is similarly placed.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
