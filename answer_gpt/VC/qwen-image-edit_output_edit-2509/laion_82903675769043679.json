    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the curved contour of the fairway, leading from the foreground toward the green, preserved in its original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the section of the fairway near the green is modified with a checkerboard pattern, altering the original smooth grass surface of the fairway seen in Image A. This addition visually changes the perception of the fairway's contour from what was originally a uniform green stretch.",

      "question": "Are the sand bunkers located in their original positions along the fairway, particularly near the green and on the left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the visual alterations with colorful patterns and checkerboards, the sand bunkers' placements seem unchanged from Image A. The bunkers remain visually identifiable in their original positions, confirming their locations have been preserved.",

      "question": "Is the water hazard present in the foreground, directly bordering the fairway, and reflecting the sky and structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water hazard in the foreground is not as natural-looking as in Image A. It is filled with a multicolored, mosaic-like pattern that significantly changes its original clear water appearance and reflection of the structures.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the green area still appears elevated at the back, maintaining the slight incline leading from the fairway to the green, similar to the original topography seen in Image A. Despite the added patterns, the elevation does not change visibly.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a dense group of spectators visible along the edge of the fairway, especially near the green?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
