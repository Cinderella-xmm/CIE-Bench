    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the elevated rocky outcrop forming the base of the island still present with its original silhouette and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the island still retains a rocky outcrop but it's heavily altered with the addition of large mushrooms and vines. The silhouette appears expanded and the presence of mushrooms significantly changes its appearance compared to a natural rocky outcrop.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the houses arranged in a dense, tiered cluster ascending the slope of the island?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the houses are arranged in a dense manner similar to Image A, forming a tiered cluster due to the growth of large mushrooms creating additional tiers of vegetation that blend with the house group.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a visible road that connects the dock to the main cluster of houses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there isn't a clear, identifiable road in the scene. The presence of new elements like colorful clouds and hanging vines dominate the foreground, making it hard to discern a road.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a dock structure in a similar position as in Image A, although it is somewhat obscured by brightly colored elements in the scene, suggesting that a dock still extends into the water.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees are indeed visible in the foreground on both the left and right sides of the image, although they are partially obscured by the new fantastical elements including clouds and altered ground cover.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there large mountain peaks visible in the background behind the island?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, large mountain peaks remain visible in the background, similar to Image A, although the focus on the new fantastical elements in the foreground takes some attention away from the mountains.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting still suggests that sunlight is coming from the upper left, creating shadows that extend towards the lower right, based on the way the light interacts with the mushrooms and the island structures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the appearance of buildings with red-tiled roofs and wooden walls with earthy tones, albeit partly obscured by vibrant, fantastical elements like vines and clouds.",
