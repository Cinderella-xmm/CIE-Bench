    "Question": "Q1: Are the black-framed glasses with rectangular lenses and visible reflections on the lenses still present on the man's face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the area where glasses would typically be visible is covered by a blur, which means we cannot confirm the presence of specific features like black-framed glasses. Without visible indications of glasses, we conclude that they are no longer depicted. Based on this reasoning, we conclude that the glasses are not present.",

    "Question": "Q6: Is the lighting still coming from the front-left, creating a soft highlight on the left side of the face and a subtle shadow on the right side of the neck and shoulder?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, lighting conditions are less defined due to the uniform sepia shading typical for illustrative art styles. This results in unclear or less pronounced directional shadows or highlights. Since specific directional lighting isnâ€™t visible, we can assume the lighting condition has changed.",
