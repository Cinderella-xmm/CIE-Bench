    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the tree's central position with a wide, spreading canopy and visible branching structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree remains centrally positioned within the frame of the diorama-like setting with a wide, spreading canopy. The branches are visibly structured, just as they usually are in real trees depicted in such artistic styles, maintaining the image's balance and focal point.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the leaves of the tree still displaying a visible gradient from green to orange and red?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves of the tree still exhibit a gradient transitioning from green to shades of orange and red. This is visually evident as it closely follows the pattern often seen in autumn trees where leaves change color, which is a characteristic artistic representation seen from real-world nature.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the meadow clearly divided into a pink/red floral area on the left and a green daisy-filled area on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the meadow shows a distinct division: the left side is visually filled with pink and red flowers, while the right side contains a green section with white daisies. This separation is clearly visible and mimics the original composition typically designed for artistic depth.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are white daisies still present in the green section of the meadow on the right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "White daisies can be seen clearly in the right section of the meadow in Image B. This maintains the visual consistency with the white daisy placement typical in meadow scenes to provide contrast against the green background.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a visible glow or backlight effect shining through the tree’s leaves from behind?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible glow or backlight effect shining through the tree's leaves. The lighting is more consistent with a typical room glow or shadowing effect of a diorama than a natural, intense backlight.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the tree's base visibly rooted in the ground of the meadow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree’s base is visible and gives the illusion of being rooted within the flat background of this diorama-style setup. While the ground doesn't have the realistic topographical detail as in natural settings, the tree does appear anchored visually to the meadow part of the artwork.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
