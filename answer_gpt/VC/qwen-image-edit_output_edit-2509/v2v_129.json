      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the character in the stickers is involved in some form of painting activity, but not in each sticker. In some stickers, she is shown spilling paint, reacting with surprise, or showing frustration. Hence, while painting is a theme, active painting doesn't happen in all of them.",
