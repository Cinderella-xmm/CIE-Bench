        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration shows the patient in a hospital bed with a visible IV tube running from the IV drip bag to their arm. This denotes a connection which is visually represented by the blue tubing visible against the patient's arm. Using knowledge of medical setups, this suggests a continued physical connection between the patient and the drip in the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nurse is depicted standing beside a medical cart with hands positioned as if engaged with the cart, suggestive of interaction with the contents. The stylized depiction maintains a context of activity that aligns with the typical hospital scene shown in the original context.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes visual elements that indicate the presence of medical monitors. These are depicted with lines and numbers consistent with medical data readouts. Even within a stylized format, it is clear that these are meant to represent the monitors seen in hospital settings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patient is shown reclining in a bed, appearing relaxed as suggested by the position of the body, which aligns with a resting position. The stylization does not suggest any change in demeanor or posture compared to a relaxed state, although specific details such as eyes closed are not explicitly clear due to artistic style.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The IV stand in Image B is clearly positioned next to the patient's bed, identical to the medical setting depicted typically near the patient's side in such environments. The proximity and placement within the stylized image are consistent with that role.",
