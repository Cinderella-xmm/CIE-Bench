      "question": "Is the white-framed window visible on the front face of the transformed structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a white-framed window is clearly visible on the front face of the transformed structure. The artistic design emphasizes intricate patterns and a grand doorway as part of its main features, making the window quite prominent. This demonstrates that a window is an essential element of many domiciliary structures by general architectural knowledge.",

      "question": "Is the small red structure located to the left of the main chalet still present in the transformed scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a scene that seems to derive from fantasy, characterized by alien-like architecture and glowing waterways rather than a small red structure that appears in Image A. When comparing both images, there is no trace of any small red structure in Image B, suggesting a complete reimagining of the scenery that moves away from the simple alpine huts present in more realistic environments.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the waterway flow from the bottom-right corner toward the center-left of the image, maintaining its original course?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waterway flows straight from the center bottom toward the large structure located in the center of the image. This pathway diverges considerably from the course observed in Image A, where the water flows from bottom-right to center-left. The altered path and glowing appearance indicate a different conceptual interpretation of a stream or river.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the large patch of snow located directly in front of the chalet still visible and positioned in the same place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible patch of snow directly in front of the main structure, contrasting with the snow patches found in Image A. The absence of snow and presence of fantasy elements indicate that the environmental details were entirely transformed, taking on an other-worldly vibe.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are moss-covered rocks visible along the edges of the stream in the transformed scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the stream have been replaced with large, claw-like roots, and there are glowing pathways instead of a natural rocky stream with moss in Image A. Thus, moss-covered rocks are not apparent in the edited image, which showcases fantastical roots instead.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the transformed structure located in the mid-ground, slightly to the right of the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the transformed structure directly in the center from mid-ground to background, occupying a predominant position. In comparison to Image A, where the chalet is slightly right of center, the edited image makes the structure central and more prominent as part of a fantastical scenario.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the mountain peaks visible in the background, with snow patches and mist covering their upper portions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature mountain peaks or natural snow patches as seen in Image A. Instead, steep rocks or cliffs in a mystical setting devoid of snow and actual mist replace the mountains. This constitutes a stark departure from the realistic mountainous landscape presented earlier.",
