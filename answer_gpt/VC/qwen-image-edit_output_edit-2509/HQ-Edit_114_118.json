      "question": "Does the ship retain exactly three masts, with sails arranged in tiers on each mast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the ship inside the dome indeed has three masts. Each mast features sails that are arranged in tiers, maintaining a classic tall ship configuration. This observation aligns with typical sailing ships, which often feature such a mast and sail layout. Thus, the arrangement in Image B comprises three masts with tiered sails.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the ship’s hull shaped with a raised stern and a decorated, upward-curving prow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship’s hull does have a raised stern and an upward-curving prow, which are common features of traditional sailing ships, giving them a distinct silhouette that aids in stability and sea navigation. The careful model construction under the dome captures these elements, indicating a faithful reproduction of this ship type.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there multiple sails on each of the three masts, with at least two tiers per mast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the ship with several sails on each of the three masts arranged in at least two tiers. This is consistent with the design of typical 18th-century sailing ships that optimize wind capture with multi-tiered sail arrangements, providing evidence that the model accurately replicates this functional design aspect.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there at least five seagulls visible in flight around the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, one can count the presence of seagulls around the ship. Upon close inspection, there are fewer than five seagulls visible, which visually indicates a limited number compared to typical representations of maritime settings, where flocks can be observed.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the ship oriented such that the bow points toward the left side of the image and is slightly elevated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orientation of the ship is such that the bow points to the right side of the image. The depiction inside the dome clearly faces the opposite direction from what the question suggests. Additionally, there’s no evidence indicating that the ship’s bow is elevated.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible portholes along the sides of the ship’s hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hull details are faithfully rendered but lack visible portholes, which are small openings commonly found on ship sides for light and air. Based on the size and details of the model, it seems that such specifics are either not included or are less defined within the context of the model.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the ship positioned above the surface of the water/resin layer, appearing to float?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship model is held within a dome atop a resin layer designed to mimic the sea. The depiction implies that the ship rests directly upon this resin, simulating floating on water as opposed to hovering above it. Its position simulates the quintessential image of ships at sea.",
