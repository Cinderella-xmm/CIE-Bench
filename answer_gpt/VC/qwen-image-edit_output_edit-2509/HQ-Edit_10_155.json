      "question": "Does the edited image retain the metallic base of the lantern with visible engraved and perforated patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the lantern clearly shows a metallic base with detailed engravings and perforations. It is positioned within a miniature market setting under a glass dome. The visual cues of the metallic base, such as its color and texture, are consistent with the original image (Image A), which features similar engravings and perforations. Thus, the metallic base with these patterns is retained in the edited image.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the stained-glass body of the lantern with clearly visible colored segments in red, green, blue, and orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the lantern under a glass dome with a stained-glass body showing clearly visible colored segments in red, green, blue, and orange. This resembles the lantern's glass body in Image A, which also features distinct colored segments, confirming the retained attributes.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the textured honeycomb-like internal surface of the glass body that produces a warm, diffused glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image maintains the lantern's glass body, which produces a warm, diffused glow, suggesting the retention of a textured, honeycomb-like internal surface. This is reminiscent of Image A, where a similar texture contributes to the warm illumination of the lantern.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the domed finial with a tiered shape and a small loop at the very top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The finial in Image B, situated on top of the lantern within the glass dome, shows a tiered shape with a small loop at the very top, identical to the original image's finial design. The consistency in design indicates this feature is retained.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image show the lantern emitting a warm, internal glow from within the glass body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glow from the lantern in Image B, which is housed in a miniature market scene, is visually apparent. The warm illumination is retained from the original image (Image A), where the lantern also emits an internal glow, aligning with the function and design of such lamps.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the edited image preserve the overall silhouette of the lantern as a bulbous glass body on a flared metal base topped with a conical finial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite being placed under a glass dome, the lantern maintains the silhouette observed in Image A: a bulbous glass body, flared metal base, and conical finial. The proportions and key structural features are retained, ensuring the silhouette stays consistent between both images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the aesthetic elements of geometric Islamic motifs, visible in the miniature market scene surrounding the lantern. These motifs, including stars and diamonds adapted into street designs under a glass dome, relate to those found in Image A's background. Thus, the motifs are retained in the edited image.",
