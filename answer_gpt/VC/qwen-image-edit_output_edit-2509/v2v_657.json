      "question": "Does the edited image retain the skateboarder's black shirt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figurine and the design on the box both depict the skateboarder wearing a black shirt, which consistently matches the attire seen on the actual person in Image A. The color and style are directly reflected in the toy representation, indicating retention.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi figurine in Image B, as well as the representation on the box, exhibit blue jeans similarly to those worn by the skateboarder in Image A. This suggests that the jeans have been retained in terms of color and style in the edited image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the skateboard and its position relative to the skateboarder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figurine is shown on a skateboard, which is set beneath the figurine in a way that attempts to capture a mid-action pose, similar to that in Image A. The relative position is retained, modeled by the toy in an action stance that mimics the original.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a chibi figurine and box graphics portraying the skateboarder in a playful interpretation of a dynamic pose, similar to the dynamic, mid-action skateboarding seen in Image A. This mimicked stance suggests a retention of the pose concept, albeit in a stylized manner.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the detailed textures and colors of the skateboarder's attire and skateboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi figurine in Image B lacks the detailed textures evidenced in Image A due to the nature of such figures being more simplified and stylized. While general colors are retained, detailed textures are not. The focus is on a cartoon-like representation rather than an exact detail-by-detail replication.",
