      "question": "Are the zebras' bodies covered in distinct black and white stripes that follow the natural pattern seen in the original image, including variations in thickness and alignment across the torso, legs, and face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras are depicted with clear black and white stripes, which is a characteristic feature of zebras. The stripes in Image B seem to follow the natural pattern seen in zebras, with variations in thickness and alignment across different parts of their bodies, including the torso, legs, and face. A comparison with Image A confirms that the edited image maintains the natural stripe patterns of the zebras as seen in the original.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras are shown with their heads lowered toward the ground, which is a typical grazing posture for animals like zebras.
