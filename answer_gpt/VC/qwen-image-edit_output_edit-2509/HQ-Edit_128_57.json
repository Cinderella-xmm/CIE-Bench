      "question": "Is the lion’s head medallion present at the center of the desk's front panel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a detailed wooden panel with a central feature that resembles a lion's head medallion, visible on the front of what looks like a wooden box or cabinet. Drawing from common knowledge, such ornate designs are common in classical or vintage wooden furniture, often serving as decorative elements. Therefore, the presence of this element aligns with the expected style and can be concluded as having a lion's head medallion.",

      "question": "Does the quill maintain its feather shape, even if stylized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a quill motif is prominently featured, especially on the notebook cover. Despite its stylized presentation, the quill maintains the classic feather shape, recognizable by its contour and feather-like characteristics. Understanding that stylized designs often keep the core form for recognition, the quill, although stylized, retains its feather shape.",

      "question": "Is the book depicted as open, showing two pages of aged, yellowed paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a notebook is the main focus rather than an open book. The notebook visible does not display open pages but rather has a closed appearance with a spiral binding. The visible paper edges do not resemble aged, yellowed book pages, which typically are portrayed as ancient and worn. Therefore, the description of an open book with visible aged pages is not applicable here.",

      "question": "Does the desk retain its dark wood texture and finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Describing Image B, the central object, a box or cabinet, showcases a rich, dark wood with ornate carvings, which is consistent with traditional furniture pieces that often use such materials for a warm, elegant appearance. By this assessment, the dark wood texture and finish are retained, as seen on the detailed wooden piece.",

      "question": "Is the arched window with a grid of leaded glass panes visible behind the desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A window is faintly visible in the background of Image B. The portion seen suggests a tall, vertical design, but it doesn’t prominently display the leaded glass panes in detail. Given the image's layout, the arched window with an elaborate leaded pane design as previously described is not evidently discernible in this particular composition.",

      "question": "Are tall bookshelves with rows of leather-bound books visible to the left of the desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background on the left shows shelves which appear to be filled with books, likely similar to typical library settings with orderly arranged books. Observing the visible portions and recognizing the context of analogous images, one can infer the presence of tall bookshelves with books, maintaining an element of classical library settings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color palette is dominated by dark brown, cream, and subtle red/blue tones from the rug visible in the foreground and wooden furniture. This matches the traditional color scheme of vintage settings often seen in such compositions, suggesting a consistent use of these warm, rich hues as in classical interior decor themes.",
