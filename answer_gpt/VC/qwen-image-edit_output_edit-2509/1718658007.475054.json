      "question": "Does the edited image show the octopus with exactly eight tentacles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows an octopus-like creature prominently with multiple tentacles. By carefully counting the tentacles depicted, it can be observed that there are exactly eight distinct tentacles. The illustration style offers a clear view of each tentacle curling outwards, which helps in identifying the correct quantity through visual counting, aligning with the typical octopus anatomy that naturally possesses eight tentacles.",

      "question": "Are there two distinct, large eyes visible on the octopus’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The octopus illustrated in the edited image features two large, prominent eyes on its head, characterized by their noticeable size and distinctive placement. The eyes are positioned symmetrically on the head, emphasizing a central focus in the creature's face, which is common in cartoon portrayals to suggest expressiveness and character depth.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are suction cups visible along the underside of at least some of the octopus’s tentacles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, while the tentacles of the octopus are detailed, they do not visibly show any suction cups on their undersides. The focus of the image seems to be more on the overall appearance and setting rather than anatomical details. Typically, suction cups are a common feature of octopus tentacles, often depicted even in stylized illustrations, however, their omission here suggests a stylized or simplified design choice.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the octopus positioned on or adjacent to the beach, with part of its body in the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image presents the octopus situated adjacently to a beach setting, with the shoreline visible and some of its lower tentacles seemingly on or near the sandy area. The water's edge is depicted close to this beach area, suggesting the creature's proximity to the water, yet not definitively that a part of its body is submerged, maintaining a stylized scenic arrangement typical for illustrative posters.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the octopus clearly the largest and most prominent figure in the image, facing directly toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image makes the octopus the central and most dominant figure, undoubtedly larger and more prominent than any other elements such as the beach, water, or background trees. Its orientation toward the viewer is illustrated by the frontal view, which is visually direct and engaging, cementing its primary role in the image as well as effectively focusing attention on its detailed design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a visible stretch of sandy beach meeting the ocean water in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Foreground elements in the edited image clearly show a stretch of sandy beach leading directly to the ocean water, characterized by the visible delineation of beach sands meeting the depicted shoreline. The art style indicates a typical beach setting with waves illustrated touching the sandy edge, a key element to introduce a vibrant, coastal adventure theme consistent with the image's title and promotional nature.",
