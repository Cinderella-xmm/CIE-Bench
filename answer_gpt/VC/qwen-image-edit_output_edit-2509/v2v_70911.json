      "question": "Is the AXE logo still visible on the container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the AXE logo is prominently displayed on the left side of the container, similar to its presentation in Image A. The distinct font and position of the logo make it noticeable and easily recognizable. Therefore, the AXE logo is still visible.",

      "question": "Does the container retain its cylindrical shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the container maintains its overall cylindrical shape, even though its top has a broken appearance with an energy explosion emanating from it. Despite this alteration at the top, the basic cylindrical form of the container is still evident.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the fiery red and energetic pink hues from the label's explosive design still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B continues to display the fiery red and pink hues in the label design, similar to Image A, emphasizing a dynamic and energetic style. The striking colors are not only present on the label but are also echoed in the explosion effect emerging from the container, reinforcing the theme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the net weight text (\"NET WT 2.64 OZ (75g)\") still visible on the label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the text indicating the net weight (NET WT 2.64 OZ (75g)) appears to be present on the label, as in Image A. However, the visual effect of the energy burst somewhat distracts from the text, suggesting it might not be as immediately prominent, but it is still visible.",

      "question": "Is the container depicted as mostly intact, with only a crack allowing the nebula to be seen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the container is mostly intact but features a significant opening at the top from which the nebula-like energy is emanating. This suggests the container is largely whole, with a dramatic rupture allowing the visual effect to occur.",
