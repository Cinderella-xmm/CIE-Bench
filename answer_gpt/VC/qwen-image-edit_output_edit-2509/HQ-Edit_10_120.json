    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the elderly woman’s facial expression, including the gentle smile and visible wrinkles around the eyes and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the face of the elderly woman is blurred, making it impossible to discern any detailed features such as a gentle smile or visible wrinkles. Therefore, the facial expression and specific details like wrinkles around the eyes and mouth cannot be retained due to the editing. Since we cannot see these elements, the most logical answer is that those features are not preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the elderly woman’s short, white, neatly styled hair preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the elderly woman’s hair, which appears to be short, white, and neatly styled. Despite the facial editing, her hairstyle is visible and neatly styled in the edited image, suggesting preservation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the round wire-rimmed glasses with pink-tinted lenses positioned correctly on the woman’s face in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, even though the face is blurred, the outline of glasses can still be inferred from visible parts that are not completely obscured by the blur. Thus, their presence is suggested despite the lack of detail. Therefore, the correct positioning cannot be confirmed.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the woman’s hands are clearly visible, showing gentle clasping, age-related skin texture, and veins, consistent with aspects observed in the original image. These details remain unchanged during the editing process.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in the edited image has been completely altered with a floral border and cream-colored space, removing the original scene of a tree-lined park path, green hedges, and soft daylight.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silhouette of the qipao with features such as the high collar and long sleeves seems to be preserved in the edited image. This suggests attention to retaining these traditional design elements.",
