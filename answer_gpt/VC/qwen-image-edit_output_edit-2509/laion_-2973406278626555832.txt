    "Question": "Q1: Is the transparent tank section of the vape device clearly visible, allowing the internal liquid to be seen?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the transparent tank section is visible, showing the internal components and structure of the vape device. However, the depiction is more schematic than realistic, focusing on explaining component layout rather than showing liquid contents. Through common sense, a transparent tank typically allows insight into its contents, but Image B lacks a clear depiction of any liquid level.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the black mouthpiece and cap at the top of the vape device present and correctly positioned?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the vape device illustration clearly includes a black mouthpiece and cap at the top, correctly positioned as designed for user engagement. This corresponds to typical vape device design standards where the mouthpiece is positioned for direct usage.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the coil component located at the base of the device, visible through the transparent tank?",
    "explanation": "Image B indicates a schematic representation illustrating the internal layout, including the coil which is primarily positioned above the battery, but not at the base of the transparent tank. Image B focuses more on the internal structure rather than explicit transparency displaying internal liquid alongside coil.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the liquid inside the transparent tank clearly visible and present at a measurable level?",
    "explanation": "Image B represents the internal components and function through illustrative diagrams but does not show liquid in the tank at a specific level. The visualization focuses on architecture rather than the conditions of liquid presence, thereby not showing any measurable liquid content.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the internal components (coil, liquid, battery) arranged in a logically consistent vertical alignment within the device?",
    "explanation": "Image B, through its orderly schematic, indicates a logical layout where components are vertically aligned, showcasing typical design principles for efficiency and operation. This reflects the arrangement related to structural integrity adhering to the operational flow in vape devices.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is an airflow pathway indicated or implied in the deviceâ€™s structure, such as an inlet near the base?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the schematic includes pathways showing functional logic of airflow within the device's structure. Though an inlet is implied near the base through design lines, emphasizing airflow as a critical aspect in such devices.",
    "answer": "Yes"
