      "question": "Is Joseph depicted holding a lantern in his right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a figure likely representing Joseph, characterized by traditional religious attire. However, the figure is not holding a lantern in his right hand; instead, the hands are clasped in prayer. Typically, Joseph would be depicted with humble pose, perhaps holding a lantern in some nativity scenes, but that detail is absent here.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure representing Mary is depicted standing with a prayerful gesture. Her hands are clasped in front of her chest, akin to a common representation of her in the nativity scene, reflecting reverence and admiration. However, she is not kneeling, but standing.",

      "is_correct": false

      "question": "Is the infant Jesus lying in a manger with a halo composed of radiating lines around his head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the infant Jesus is depicted lying in a manger-like structure, which is a typical representation in the nativity scene. He is shown with a halo, indicated by the gold embellishments around the head, but it is not composed of radiating lines as is also common in religious art.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are a donkey and a sheep present in the scene, positioned near the manger?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two animals are present, one on each side of the manger. The animals resemble sheep based on their small size and typical sheep posture in religious art. A donkey is not present in this depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature any roof or five-pointed star at the top of any structure. The scene is more focused on the figures within an arch-like setting without a visible roof and star.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict any such elements like a stylized palm tree, which would be more common in larger outdoor nativity scenes rather than this intricately detailed indoor decorative piece.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, halos are depicted as subtle gold bands around the heads of the adult figures, likely representing Joseph and Mary. Jesus, being represented as an infant in a manger, does not have a separate circular halo other than the elaborately designed manger he lies within.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the infant Jesus is indeed placed inside a manger-like structure, but the scene does not explicitly depict a roof above it. The setting is more focused on the figures and background architecture rather than a defined stable roof as often depicted.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Joseph is positioned on the left, while Mary is on the right with Jesus centrally placed in the manger. This arrangement is typical of nativity scenes, where the holy family is centered, depicting the symbol of family and holiness.",
