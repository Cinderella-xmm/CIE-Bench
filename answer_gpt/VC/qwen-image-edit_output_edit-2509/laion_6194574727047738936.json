      "question": "Is the pink flamingo-shaped mug with a white beak and curved neck present in the same position relative to the cereal bars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pink flamingo-shaped mug with a white beak and curved neck is visible on the left side of the frame, positioned behind the cereal creations that have been edited to have cartoon faces. In Image A, the mug is visible in a similar position behind the cereal bars. Thus, relative to the cereal bars or creations, the mug remains in the same place.",

      "question": "Are the words \"freee\" and \"corn flakes\" visible on the cereal box, along with the bird logo above the brand name?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cereal box is visible in the background and features decorative elements that suggest branding and packaging design elements might be present. However, due to the decorative banner covering the top part of the cereal box, the words 'freee' and 'corn flakes', along with the bird logo above the brand name, are not visible in the edited version. In Image A, these elements are clearly visible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cereal box in the background features a floral and colorful design overlay, which covers most of the box's surface and visual elements. As a result, the circular illustration of a bowl filled with corn flakes is obscured and not visible. In Image A, this illustration is clear and visible on the front of the cereal box.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image shows cereal creations on a light-colored wooden surface, which serves as their base in front of the cereal box. This is consistent with Image A, where the cereal bars are presented on a similar light-colored wooden surface.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background shows a cereal box along with decorative elements that cover part of the frame. However, an off-white wall can still be discerned around the edges of these elements, indicating its presence. This is similar to Image A, where the off-white wall is clearly seen as the background behind the cereal box.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
