      "question": "Is the large red text \"START\" above the skier still visible and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the large red text 'START' is prominently visible above the skier. The font, size, and color appear consistent with typical race start banners, indicating that it hasn't been altered in terms of visibility or design from what can be inferred without comparison. Thus, using common knowledge about race start banners, the assumption is that it remained unchanged.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the skier still hold ski poles and is dressed in skiing gear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the skier holding ski poles and wearing skiing gear, such as gloves, a bib, and what appears to be warm clothing suitable for skiing. Such equipment and attire are indicative of skiing activities. Without reference to Image A, the skier's preparedness for skiing remains evident through these visual cues.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the skier's bib with the number \"66\" still visible and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skier's bib displaying the number '66' is clearly visible on their chest. The number appears legible and unaltered, suggesting continuity in its presentation from what would be expected in such a sporting event. The visual signals strongly indicate that the bib and the number portrayed have not been changed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the snowy ground and visible ski tracks still present under the skier?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show snowy ground and ski tracks under the skier anymore; instead, there is a zebra on what appears to be a grassy gradient area. This contrasts sharply with the typical snowy environment expected in skiing scenes and suggests that the original setting has been altered.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skier maintains a posture suggestive of readiness for motion, with ski poles held out and a forward-leaning stance. Such a posture is consistent with actions typical of starting a race, displaying readiness and intent for movement.",
