    "Question": "Q4: Is the scene composed with flowers in the foreground, a hill in the midground, and the sky in the background?",
    "explanation": "Image B portrays a floating island format where flowers are present on the edges, apples float, and the scene is set against a starry sky, resembling a hill in the midsection with the sky extending to the background. This composition answers positively to the layout of flowers, a midground element, and a starry sky background.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the black support ribs visible and extending from the central hub to the edge of the canopy?",

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are yellow coneflowers and red poppies present in the foreground of the scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a variety of flowers are depicted, including some that are red and possibly yellow, but they are stylized and part of a surreal art depiction, rather than realistic flowers like yellow coneflowers and red poppies. Therefore, the presence of specific flowers like coneflowers and poppies does not apply to this heavily stylized and artistic depiction.",
