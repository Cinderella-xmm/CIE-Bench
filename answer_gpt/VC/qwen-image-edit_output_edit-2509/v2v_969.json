      "question": "Does the image retain the \"Twins\" text on the baseball uniforms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we can see the 'Twins' text on the baseball uniforms worn by the characters inside the snow globe. The red letters are clearly visible on the pinstriped uniforms, just as they are in the original Image A. They match the design commonly seen on baseball uniforms, which suggests a team name, retained from Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the black helmets with the red \"C\" visible on the characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The helmets worn by the characters inside the snow globe in Image B are black with a red 'C' visible on the front. This suggests continuity from Image A, where the characters also wore similar helmets. The design is typical for baseball helmets, where team logos are often displayed.",

      "question": "Do the characters still hold wooden baseball bats?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The characters in Image B are depicted holding wooden baseball bats, evident from their pose and the color plus texture of the object they are holding, consistent with baseball bats. This reflects continuity from Image A, where the characters are similarly holding baseball bats.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure inside the snow globe is wearing a blue jacket, which is consistent with the attire of the central figure in Image A. The blue jacket provides a visual contrast against the striped uniforms of the individuals to either side.",

      "question": "Do the characters maintain their cheerful facial expressions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since the characters' faces are blurred in both Image A and Image B, it's impossible to determine their facial expressions. The blurring obscures any detail that would normally communicate expressions, so we cannot ascertain if they are cheerful.",
