      "question": "Is the second boy depicted as bald?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a boy drawn with a bald head. Observing the cartoon characters, his head is smooth, round, and free of hair, which is typically how a bald person is visually depicted. This bald representation matches the character design common in children's illustrations where they depict baldness with a clean head.",

      "question": "Does the first boy wear black-framed glasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the first boy does not have any visual indicators of wearing black-framed glasses. Typically, glasses would be visibly drawn on the character's face, with frames and lenses, often highlighted by a contrasting color. However, the character in the image displays no such features.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the bald boy holding the tablet with both hands in an upright position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bald boy is holding a device, but the character's hands are not depicted in any holding position typically associated with supporting a tablet with both hands. The character's posture and the representation of the tablet do not align with holding it upright in both hands as depicted in visually traditional manners in media.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the boy with glasses leaning forward toward the tablet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boy is not illustrated with a leaning-forward posture. This would usually involve the character's upper body directed forward toward the tablet, suggesting engagement. However, the posture presented is sitting upright without indication of leaning. The body language in cartoons usually mimics this action by showing movement lines or inclination which are absent here.",

      "question": "Does the tablet screen display a colorful indoor scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are cartoon tablets presenting colorful scenes, potentially indoors. The scenes typically include bright, varied colors and illustrations of settings free from outdoor elements, aligning with indoor spaces as shown by window panes and furniture. Illustrated books and digital screens often portray colorful scenes to engage viewers.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are both boys seated at a table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration shows the characters near what is interpreted as a table-like structure; however, they seem to be arranged around it in dynamic poses suggesting action or play, a common depiction in imaginative or animated illustrations. Unlike realistic seating, characters appear to be in playful or non-static positions often found in playful art.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no backpacks are visualized. The illustration focuses on a playful, stylized classroom environment with elements like books, robots, and digital devices. Given the cartoon style, elements like a backpack would typically be depicted in a simplified form but are not present here. They are either omitted or blended with other illustrated elements.",
