    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a visible gular pouch located beneath the lower mandible of the beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there appears to be only a simplified representation of a pelican, resembling a cartoon or decorative figure. The beak and the area beneath it do not have the detailed structure of a real pelican's gular pouch, which is a distinctive, expandable skin used for catching fish. Instead, the area beneath the beak appears solid and without distinguishing features of a gular pouch.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the feet clearly webbed with visible claws at the tips of each toe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a stylized representation of a pelican where the feet have a simplistic structure. The webbed detail and individual claws that are usually visible on a real pelican's foot are absent. Instead, the feet are shown as solid structures without detailed differentiation between toes or webbing.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the feathers on the body composed of layered, striated structures with visible individual feather shafts and overlapping edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feathers are not realistically detailed. They are represented in pastel colors and smooth shapes without visible shafts or overlapping details found in natural bird feathers. This suggests a stylized, rather than realistic, depiction of how feathers are structured.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bird have a long neck curving down from the head to a broad, rounded body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a simplified pelican figure with a long neck that curves naturally from the head to connect to the broader body. This mimics the general physical structure of a real pelican, albeit in a cartoonish style.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are both legs positioned under the body, supporting the pelican in a grounded standing pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure of the pelican presents only a single foot visible which is attached directly to a flat surface, suggesting it is not freestanding but instead part of a decorative piece. The second leg is not visibly supporting the figure on the ground.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a single dark, round eye visible on the side of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a large, singular dark round eye on the side of the head, matching the typical cartoon style where features are often exaggerated. This is a common representation of eyes in cartoon characters.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a small tuft of feathers raised at the crown of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican is shown wearing a small sailor's hat, and there is no visible tuft of feathers at the crown of the head, as the hat covers this area entirely.",
