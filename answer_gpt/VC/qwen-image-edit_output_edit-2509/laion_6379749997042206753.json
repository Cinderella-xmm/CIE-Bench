        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image illustrates various character designs and uses whimsical lettering for text elements. The jar with popcorn is featured, but the brand name 'Karls' is not explicitly visible or emphasized on the label as the letters seem jumbled or altered for a thematic effect, making the recognition of text challenging.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, a jar is shown, but the text appears distorted or altered with whimsical typography and may not directly represent the phrase 'Pumpkin Spice Popcorn' as expected, thus making it difficult to identify the exact text.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a jar that resembles the design of a clear container with a lid, but given the playful art style and thematic distortions, it cannot be specifically identified as having a silver metal lid, especially considering the fantasy elements utilized in the artwork.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image displays illustrations of popcorn and bowls, but they are stylized and part of an artistic narrative, which differs from the depiction of ceramic dishware like a white bowl with a blue rim common in realistic portrayals.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, popcorn is illustrated in various stages and forms, but specific elements such as clear jars containing unpopped kernels are not part of this artistic depiction or narrative.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image incorporates a thematic, illustrative style using friendly colors, and orange is prominently utilized. However, given the cartoon nature and emphasis on fantasy elements, brown isn't a dominant color in the way labels or realistic popcorn might appear, as seen in product placements.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering the edited image, it showcases characters and artistic illustrations rather than an explicit setting with elements like a wooden surface; thus, the design focus is more on abstract or thematic elements than grounded backgrounds.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image involves a cartoon-style depiction where popped corn is visible in various thematic designs and explorative narratives, but there's no realistic portrayal of scattered kernels around jars as seen in real-life setups.",
