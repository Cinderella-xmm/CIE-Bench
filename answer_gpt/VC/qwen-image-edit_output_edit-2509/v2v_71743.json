        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual information from Image B, the text 'NEW YORK Guitar Method' is placed prominently at the top of the cover. The font is consistent with what is commonly used for visibility and clarity on book covers, suggesting that it should be readable. Despite the decorative elements on the cover, this main title text remains legible, implying that it is designed to be clearly visible to viewers.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the author's name 'by Bruce Arnold' is included immediately below the main book title in a smaller font but still maintains clarity. Traditionally, the author's name is smaller than the title but is still made legible for identification. This suggests that the name should be visible on the cover without necessary obstructions.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower part of the cover appears to have text overlaid on a green rectangle, but the text reads as 'A Esqiproïtntmptûdeb.S', which does not correspond to 'Ensemble Book 2.' Comparing this portion with Image A confirms that the text has been altered.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a logo in the upper right portion of the cover featuring a figure holding a musical instrument, and underneath appears to be text related to 'MUSE EEK.' Exposure to book covers confirms that such logos are typically positioned conspicuously for branding purposes. A comparison with Image A verifies that this logo remains consistent, confirming its presence on the edited cover.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B gives a clear view of a guitar that stretches in a diagonal orientation from the bottom left to the top right, traversing across a cityscape background. Diagonal placement allows for a dynamic visual effect and helps in attracting reader attention. Comparison with Image A indicates that the diagonal positioning of the guitar remains unchanged.",
