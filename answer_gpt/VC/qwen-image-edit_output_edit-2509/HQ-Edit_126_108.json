    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the two large dark boulders positioned in the foreground grassy area near the cliff edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground shows a grassy area near the edge of the cliff with two prominent dark boulders visible. They are positioned in such a way that they suggest they are on the grassy plain leading to the cliff. This positioning is typical and conceivable for a natural rocky outcrop at a cliff's edge.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a visible dirt path curving through the grass toward the cliff edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a distinct dirt path winding through the lush grass in the foreground, heading towards the edge of the waterfall. This is a common feature showing wear and foot traffic through grassy terrain and is part of the scene's natural setting.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are tree branches extending from the top-left corner into the frame, casting shadows over the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, there is no presence of tree branches extending into the frame, nor are there shadows cast over the foreground that originate from such branches. While the original image possesses these elements, the edited image has introduced an overlaying mystical figure, and some foreground details like shadows cast by trees may have been partially obscured.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sunlight illuminating the scene from the right side, casting warm golden light on the waterfall and mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is consistent with sunlight coming from the right, evident in the warm tones illuminating the waterfall and distant mountains. The golden hue reflects typical sunset or sunrise lighting, which enhances the scene's vibrancy and realism.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a wide river flowing across a flat plain above the waterfall, with scattered green islands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, there is indeed a wide river depicted above the waterfall, which flows across a broad and flat expanse. Scattered throughout the river are small green islands, adding to the detail and realism of the scene. This geographic feature is common in natural landscapes where large waterfalls and rivers are present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there dark, layered mountains visible in the background under a partly cloudy sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes a series of dark, layered mountains under a sky with some cloud cover. These mountains are typically portrayed in natural sceneries as distant silhouettes that frame the landscape, enhancing the depth of the image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there visible mist rising from the base of the waterfall and diffusing into the air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts mist clearly rising from the waterfall's base, which disperses into the air above. This atmospheric effect is consistent with the natural occurrence of water vapor at the base of large waterfalls, where water impacts stones or a pool below.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
