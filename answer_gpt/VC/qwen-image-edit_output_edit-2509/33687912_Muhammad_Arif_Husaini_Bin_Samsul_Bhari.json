    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the sun positioned low on the horizon, centered between the two silhouetted landmasses, and appearing as a bright, circular disc?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sun is not visible because it is obscured by a large, artistic shell and vibrant sea-themed elements. Given this obstruction, it is impossible to determine if the sun retains its original position or appearance as seen in Image A, where it was a bright, circular disc low on the horizon between two landmasses.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there two distinct silhouetted landmasses, one on the left and one on the right, framing the horizon and the sun?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two silhouetted landmasses can still be seen, one on the left and one on the right. These landmasses frame the horizon and define the space where the sun would naturally be positioned, although the center is now occupied by artistic elements.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the water surface reflect the orange-red gradient of the sky, creating shimmering patterns that mirror the sunset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of reflecting an orange-red gradient, the water surface is artistically altered with vivid, colorful waves that include blues and purples, deviating from the natural reflection observed in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sky filled with a gradient of warm orange near the horizon transitioning to deeper red and maroon tones higher up?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky retains a gradient of warm orange near the horizon transitioning to deeper red tones as it moves upwards. This gradient is consistent with the natural sunset hues seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a clear, straight horizon line dividing the sky and water, with the sun resting directly on it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horizon line is obscured by the artistic shell and marine elements, rendering it not clear. The sun is also not visible resting on this line due to these additions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there faint, thin clouds visible in the upper portion of the sky, partially illuminated by the sunset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are thin clouds in the upper portion of the sky, similar to those observed in Image A. These clouds appear to be partially illuminated by the sunset, though their prominence is reduced compared to the original image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the water surface show gentle ripples and small waves, indicating calm movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water surface no longer displays gentle ripples or small waves indicative of calm movement. Instead, it features artistically stylized waves with vivid, unrealistic colors, suggesting a more dramatic and creative interpretation than the natural setting in Image A.",
