      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the overall shape of the food arrangement a perfect heart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of the fruits and vegetables is supposed to resemble a heart shape. However, due to the construction using LEGO pieces, the heart appears more angular with straight edges rather than the traditionally curved design of a perfect heart shape. The LEGO construction and common geometric principles lead to the conclusion that it does not form a perfect heart.",

      "question": "Is the avocado shown as half-cut with the pit cavity visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts an avocado that is represented in part by LEGO pieces, showing a design that mimics the appearance of a half-cut avocado with a visible pit cavity. The combination of real ingredients and LEGO pieces enhances the understanding of this visual representation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the asparagus stalks bundled together with a visible twine-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the asparagus stalks are real and visibly bundled with a twine-like structure. This is evident from the image where the asparagus stalks are bound together, supported by world knowledge of typical vegetable presentation practices.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries grouped together at the top-left of the heart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fruits such as blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries are indeed grouped together near the top-left corner of the heart shape constructed with LEGO. This aligns with common fruit arrangement practices for visual appeal, observed through their clustering and positioning in the image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a depiction of a single red onion situated in proximity to broccoli and garlic. This is evident from their distinct colors and recognizable shapes, which confirm their positions when analyzed within the image's arrangement.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there at least three white mushrooms grouped together near the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, it appears that at least three white mushrooms are placed near the center of the heart shape, based on their recognizable shape and color, consistent with world knowledge regarding mushroom appearance and clustering in food arrangements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a large red bell pepper at the bottom-right of the heart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a large red bell pepper depicted towards the bottom-right of the overall food and LEGO arrangement. This is apparent from the obvious visual cues provided by the bright red color and characteristic shape, enhancing the recognition of the bell pepper's placement.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is indeed a neutral gray surface made up of LEGO base plates. This observation is strengthened by recognizing the uniform color and texture typical of LEGO base plates, offering a neutral backdrop to the colorful arrangement.",
