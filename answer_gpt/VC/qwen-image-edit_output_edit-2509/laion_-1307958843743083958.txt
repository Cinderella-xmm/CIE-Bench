    "Question": "Q1: Are the cheetahs in a seated position with bent hind legs, tucked tails, and upright front paws?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetahs appear in a sitting position with bent hind legs. The tails are visible and seem to be resting on the base behind their bodies.

    "Question": "Q2: Is the head of each cheetah turned slightly to the side, away from the central divider?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the heads of the cheetahs are indeed turned slightly away from the central divider. They are facing outward, which creates a symmetrical display that is consistent with many decorative arrangements where figures are positioned equidistant from a central focal point.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does each cheetah rest on a two-tiered base with a black upper section and a bronze-colored stepped lower section?",
    "explanation": "Looking at Image B, each cheetah is seated on a base that has a black upper section, which is evident from its glossy appearance, and a bronze-colored lower section that resembles typical metallic finishes observed in decorative items. The stepped design implies multiple levels, confirming the description.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the cheetah figures positioned symmetrically, one on the left and one on the right, equidistant from the center?",
    "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the cheetahs positioned on either side of the central divider, forming a mirror image. They are equidistant from the center, which is an arrangement often seen in symmetrical art pieces, maintaining balance and visual harmony.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there exactly three vertical panels positioned between the cheetahs, with two narrower ones flanking a wider central one?",
    "explanation": "Image B has a single greenish structure between the cheetahs, which appears as a single unit and doesnâ€™t reflect distinct panel separation. The design suggests one cohesive piece rather than separate panels, leading to the conclusion that three panels are not present.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the tail of each cheetah curve upward and rest on the base behind the body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, each cheetah's tail is visible and appears to curve but doesn't exhibit a distinctive upward trajectory as indicated. Instead, the tails seem to be resting behind their bodies on the base in a more horizontal manner. This reflects typical tail placements in seated positions.",
    "answer": "No"
