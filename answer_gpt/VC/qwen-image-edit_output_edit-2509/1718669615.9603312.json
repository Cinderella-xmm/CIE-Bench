      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the presence of two parallel railway tracks extending into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, instead of railway tracks, there is a textured, undulating surface that resembles a desert or surreal landscape with wave-like patterns. The visual cues show no evidence of railway tracks at all. Given the absence of such structures, the answer is based on recognizing the surface patterns that are more artistic and abstract rather than functional railway tracks.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the railway track visibly curved to the right as it recedes into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there is no railway track present. The landscape is comprised of visually flowing lines that emanate from the foreground and create a symmetrical abstract pattern. There is no identifiable track that curves to the right; hence, the answer relies on the absence of such railway features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the UFO positioned directly above the central axis of the railway track?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a clear horizontal line separating the sky from the land in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the horizon is easily identifiable as a line where the patterned ground beneath meets the sky above. This cue is derived from the contrast between the sky's blue and cloud formations against the earth-tone patterns below. The logical determination is that this constitutes a clear horizontal line separating sky from land.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the railway track visibly elevated above the surrounding ground level?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows only a flat, wave-like landscape pattern without railway tracks or any elevation suggesting differences from a surrounding ground. The logic lies in the visual cues of abstract land patterns that do not depict elevations characteristic of raised railway tracks.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the railway tracks converge toward a single point on the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image absence of railway tracks means there are no lines that converge. The abstraction in the image features flowing patterns that fan out symmetrically across the landscape, not converging towards the horizon. This reasoning is based on the absence of tracks and based on observing the artwork's symmetrical nature.",
