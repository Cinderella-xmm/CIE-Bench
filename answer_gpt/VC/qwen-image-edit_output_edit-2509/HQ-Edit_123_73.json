    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the original grayish stone texture of the pyramid’s surface retained, including visible weathering and erosion patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the pyramid is designed with intricate patterns and a representation of a dragon which entirely alters the texture seen in a traditional stone pyramid. This creative depiction removes any realistic stone weathering or erosion patterns that would typically identify an ancient structure.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the top platform of the pyramid preserved as a flat, rectangular structure with defined edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top platform of the pyramid appears to have been transformed to include a dragon-like creature integrated into the design, which disrupts the flat, rectangular, and defined appearance usually seen in classic pyramidal structures.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the central staircase remain aligned along the front face of the pyramid, extending from the top temple to the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the central staircase still runs from the top to the bottom of the pyramid. Despite the fantastical elements like the dragon, this structural aspect remains similar to the typical pyramid design with a clearly aligned staircase.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there exactly nine distinct tiers visible in the pyramid’s structure, decreasing in size from bottom to top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are indications of tiered structure, but the presence of the mythical creature and additional alterations make it difficult to specifically count the number of tiers as nine. The intricate design and fantastical elements obscure a clear count of tiers.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are patches of moss and small vegetation visible along the edges and steps of the pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artistically altered design of the pyramid with a dragon and iridescent light does not allow for typical signs of natural aging like moss or small vegetation on steps or edges.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the shadow cast by the pyramid positioned to the lower right, consistent with sunlight coming from the upper left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a fantastical setting with neon lighting, mostly emanating from the central element of the dragon’s chest, which does not indicate conventional sun positions and shadow directions as in real-world physics.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the pyramid located in the center of a dense tropical jungle, with trees surrounding it on all sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images depict a pyramid surrounded by dense greenery. However, in Image B the surroundings include vibrant, fantastical plant life surrounding the structure, consistent with a jungle-like environment.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the top platform of the pyramid covered with dry soil and patches of moss, indicating natural overgrowth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top platform accommodates a dragon-like creature, departing from having any soil or moss that might convey natural overgrowth.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Are there multiple white vehicles parked on the grassy area near the base of the pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene does not depict any vehicles, as the area surrounding the pyramid is dominated by fantastical elements, making it contrary to the real-life observation of cars near archaeological sites.",
