      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress maintains the same pattern as seen in Image A.

      ],

      "explanation": "In Image B, the beads on the hair appear to have the same sequence and arrangement as those in Image A.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the previously stacked bangles on both wrists from Image A are not present in the same form or color sequence. Instead, the arms display a continuation of the mosaic pattern, replacing the traditional bangles.",
