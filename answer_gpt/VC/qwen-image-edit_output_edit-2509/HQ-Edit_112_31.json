      "question": "Is there a white blaze running down the center of the horse's face from the forehead to the muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush toy emulating a horse features a white blaze running vertically down its face, from the forehead to the muzzle. This is created using stitching and fabric materials, mimicking the natural marking typically seen on real horses. The blaze is a common marking and is depicted clearly on the toy. The analysis was based solely on the visual observation of the edited image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the horse have a large white patch on its left side, extending from the shoulder toward the flank?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plush toy in Image B exhibits large white patches that imitate markings found in real horses. This patch extends from the shoulder on the left side towards the flank, intended to replicate the white markings seen on horses. This conclusion is drawn from the visual design of the plushie.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the horse facing slightly to the left of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush horse toy is positioned in its packaging facing directly forward, rather than towards the left or right. This straightforward presentation aligns with conventional display practices for boxed toys, emphasizing the front design of the toy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there multiple dandelion seed heads visible in the foreground, surrounding the horse’s legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush toy box contains stylized yellow flower structures that do not resemble dandelion seed heads. Unlike Image A, which features real dandelion seeds with distinct shapes, the flowers here are simplified and bright yellow, typical for a cartoon or stylized representation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B shows a pattern of trees that resemble a stylized or cartoon representation of coniferous trees. However, these are part of the toy box's design and not the realistic tall forest seen in Image A. Therefore, the context of these trees is more symbolic than naturalistic.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the aspect of lighting is artificial, given the indoor setting and the lack of natural light direction or shadows indicative of sunlight. The soft and uniform lighting does not suggest any directional sunlight as depicted in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a plush toy within a box, standing beside stylized flowers instead of a dandelion field. The toy design includes simplified flower structures that do not extend or reach the toy's legs in a realistic sense but are part of the display background.",
