    "Question": "Q1: Are the woman’s eyes clearly visible with almond-shaped pupils and defined eyeliner?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the face is blurred and indistinct, obscuring the features of the eyes. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the shape of the pupils or any eyeliner details. Based on this visual cue, it's evident that the eyes are not clearly visible, let alone almond-shaped with eyeliner.",

    "Question": "Q2: Do the earrings consist of long, golden tassels hanging from the earlobes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the earrings is not clear due to the illustrative and abstract nature of the artwork, but from the image constraints, it suggests an agreement in color and style from Image A, where they appear as elongated tassel designs. Thus, it's reasonable to deduce they might represent long, golden tassels.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are there blue frog closures running vertically down the center front of the qipao?",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the hair styled in an updo with two loose strands falling on either side of the face?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a stylized portrayal based on Image A’s hairstyle. The hair is styled in an updo; however, there are no discernible loose strands near the face due to the artistic rendering making it look sleek and without strands. With this in mind, it doesn't clearly signify the presence of loose strands.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the main fabric of the qipao red in color?",

Therefore, it's safe to affirm one red version exists.",
    "answer": "Yes"
