      "question": "Is the bird positioned in a side-facing profile, facing left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird, which resembles a phoenix, is positioned with its head and body facing towards the left. We determine this because its beak and eyes are oriented towards the left, and we can see a side profile view of the bird's face and body parts.",

      "question": "Are the bird’s feet visibly gripping the branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's feet are visible and depicted as gripping the branch upon which it is perched. This is evident from its claws securely wrapping around the branch, which is a typical position for a bird perched on a branch.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the main branch extend diagonally from the lower-left to the upper-right of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main branch appears to extend from the lower-left to the upper-right diagonally across the frame. This is identified by observing the direction in which the branch angles upwards. It starts from a bottom-left position and continues towards the upper-right direction.",

      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are multiple clusters of fiery blossoms distributed along the branches. These fiery blossoms appear at several points along various smaller twigs that stem from the main branch, creating a pattern of multiple clusters.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, white snowflakes can be seen scattered against the pale blue sky, giving the impression of snowfall. These are visible as small white specks distributed randomly across the background, which is reminiscent of a snow falling scene.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a uniform pale blue color without any visible clouds or gradients. The consistent coloration provides a clear and unobstructed backdrop against which the bird and branches are prominently featured.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the bird located near the center of the image, with blossoms appearing on both the left and right sides of the branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is centrally located, with branches extending to both the left and right. Blossoms are present on both sides of these branches, balanced out around the bird’s central position. This placement enhances the symmetrical composition visualized around the central figure of the bird.",
