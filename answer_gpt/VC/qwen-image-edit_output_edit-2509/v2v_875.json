    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the brown, segmented, textured trunk of the palm tree present with visible horizontal ridges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, within the polaroid photo held by a hand, the palm tree displays a brown, segmented trunk characterized by visible horizontal ridges. The editing process has not altered this aspect of the trunk, and this is confirmed by visual cues combined with common understanding of palm tree structures.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the long, feathery green fronds forming a radial crown at the top of the palm tree present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the palm tree within the polaroid clearly shows long, feathery green fronds forming a radial crown. This is a typical feature of palm trees, which remains unaltered in the edited image, indicating consistency with known palm tree structures.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are some of the palm frond tips visibly browned or dried?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the palm tree fronds through the polaroid photo, where some tips appear to have a browned or dried appearance. This matches common occurrences in palm trees where fronds can brown at the tips due to environmental factors.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the palm tree positioned to the left of the cactus and taller than it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, through the captured polaroid, the palm tree is to the left of the cactus. It is clearly taller than the accompanying cactus, maintaining the same relative positioning and proportions as observed in the world or nature.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the palm fronds primarily green in color, with some yellowing or browning at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the polaroid in Image B, the palm fronds appear primarily green with some signs of yellowing or browning at the edges. This reflects a natural depiction of palm trees where fronds can undergo color changes due to aging or environmental effects.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the palm tree maintain a tall, narrow trunk with a broad, rounded crown of fronds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, as seen in the polaroid picture, the palm tree retains a tall, narrow trunk that culminates in a broad, rounded crown of fronds. This characteristic is typical of many palm varieties, and the editing preserved these anatomical proportions.",
