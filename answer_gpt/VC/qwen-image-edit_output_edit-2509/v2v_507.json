        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character features a body styled to look like a smartphone, which has a prominent pink color. The original phone in Image A also has a pink color. By comparing these color schemes, it is clear that the chibi character maintains the same pink color scheme from the original phone, as the body color of the chibi character matches that of the phone.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the chibi character with a body shaped like a phone that includes a dual-camera setup on the upper part of its body. Image A depicts a phone with a dual-camera setup. The chibi character in Image B clearly integrates this dual-camera configuration in its design, reflecting the original phone's design elements.",

      "question": "Does the chibi character's outfit and accessories reflect the sleek and modern design aesthetic of the original phone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character wears a tech-inspired ensemble with a black blazer, grey pants, and white shoes, combined with elements of technology like a tablet and stylus. The original phone in Image A embodies a sleek, minimalist design. Thus, Image B emulates a sleek and modern design aesthetic through the chibi character's clothing and accessories, mirroring the phone's design philosophy.",

      "question": "Does the chibi character have elongated legs as specified, while maintaining a balance with the phone's design elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the chibi character in a proportionate and balanced manner with shorter legs compared to overall body size. This maintains harmony with the phone's design elements, which focus more on a square body region. Therefore, the character does not feature specifically elongated legs, aligning with a balanced portrayal.",

      "question": "Is the solid background color chosen to complement the pink color scheme of the original phone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a blue background for the chibi character, contrasting with the phone's pink color scheme, which stands out against the more neutral, beige bedding background in Image A. This choice of blue does not specifically complement the pink color scheme of the phone as it does not enhance or match the color palette.",
