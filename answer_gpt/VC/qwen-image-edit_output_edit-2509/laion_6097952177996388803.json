      "question": "Are the two main mountain peaks still present and positioned side by side as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a prominent fantastical creature occupying the foreground and part of the mid-ground, but I can discern two peaks in the background that faintly resemble those in Image A. However, the creature might be obscuring part of the view, yet the presence of two peaks seems apparent. By combining visual cues with my understanding of landscape photography, it can be deduced that the peaks are still side by side.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the summits of both peaks retain patches of snow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, in the background, both mountain peaks appear to have patches of snow on their summits, aligning with the typical appearance of snow-covered peaks. The snowy patches are recognizable by their stark white color against the otherwise darker mountain areas. This observation, combined with usual snow distribution in high altitudes, confirms that both peaks exhibit snow patches.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the horizontal and vertical rock strata visible on the mountain faces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the view of the mountain faces is somewhat obscured though Hints of geological features like rock strata are discernible to some extent. Typically, these striations manifest as naturally occurring textures. Due to the creature and perspective, close details are harder to assess than in Image A. Thus, these strata are not clearly visible.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the narrow road visible winding through the lower valley, extending toward the base of the mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fantastical creature occupies a significant portion of the landscape, obscuring the lower valley area where the road would be located. Considering typical landscape layout, the presence of such a massive creature likely means the fine detail of a narrow road is concealed or not depicted. Therefore, the road is not visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the slopes covered in patches of brownish-orange heather and dry grass, particularly in the mid-ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows much of the foreground dominated by a creature with textures resembling vines and grass. The color palette used in the image shifts to green and mystical elements, rather than the natural brownish-orange of heather and dry grass. With no clear patches visible as in Image A's mid-ground, those specific slope textures aren't present in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the sky uniformly overcast with no direct sunlight, resulting in soft shadows across the landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky appears to be overcast, similar to Image A, which is typical of an environment with little to no direct sunlight. This condition results in diffused light and soft shadows, a common effect seen under such atmospheric circumstances. Thus, despite the fantastical elements, the lighting and shadow suggest an overcast sky without strong sunlight.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the valleys show smooth, continuous contour lines that follow the natural slope of the land?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the introduction of the giant creature with its intertwined vines disturbs the continuity and smooth contours typically found in natural landscapes. While the background may hint at some natural formations, the creature's presence interrupts the perception of any continuous land slope seen in Image A, consequently affecting the landscape appearance.",
