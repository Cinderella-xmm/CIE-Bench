    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the creature’s back or head feature a series of upward-pointing, layered spires that mimic the original building’s roofline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the creature's back and head display distinctive features. The creature has sharp, pointed forms reminiscent of spires. These are layered and seem to rise upwards, similar to the architectural style of the building in the background of the image. This visual mimicry indicates an intentional design choice to echo the building's ornate spires, suggesting an aesthetic link between the two.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the creature’s body composed of or covered in a golden-hued, metallic material matching the original building’s exterior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature does not have a golden-hued, metallic exterior. Instead, its body is primarily dark with accents that may appear more like highlights than actual metallic materials. In contrast, the building features a warm golden tone, particularly highlighted by the evening light. Therefore, the creature's body does not match the building's exterior material.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a reflective water surface directly beneath the creature, mirroring its form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a water surface below the building and creature. This surface reflects the lower portion of the creature, creating a mirrored effect. This is consistent with the concept of a reflective body of water in the foreground, which serves to reflect its immediate surroundings, including the creature.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the creature exhibit a symmetrical, octagonal or radial body structure consistent with the original building’s layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B does not display an overtly symmetrical, octagonal, or radial body structure. Its form is more organic and irregular, unlike the structured, symmetrical layout of the building behind it, which presents more defined geometric shapes typical of architectural designs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are arched window-like structures or column-like protrusions visible on the creature’s body, echoing the original building’s features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the creature does not have visible arched windows or column-like structures. The building in the background is characterized by these features, yet the creature's body does not incorporate similar architectural elements, instead emphasizing more organic, jagged, and layered forms.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the scene illuminated with warm, golden-hour lighting, creating long shadows and a soft glow on the creature and surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is indeed warm and consistent with what is often described as golden-hour lighting. This type of lighting is characterized by its soft glow and the creation of long shadows, which are evident in how the light falls upon both the building and the creature, lending an overall warm aesthetic to the scene.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are tall trees with autumn-colored leaves visible in the background behind the creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analysis of Image B, the background does contain tall trees, and they appear to have leaves that are turning shades typical of autumn, such as warm browns and golds. Therefore, the presence of autumn-colored foliage in the image is consistent with the question.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is there a stone platform beneath the creature with inscribed plinths, similar to those under the original building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature is positioned on a surface similar to the stone platform under the building, with steps leading up to it. However, there are no clearly visible inscribed plinths beneath the creature that distinctly match those of the building, suggesting a lack of detailed architectural similarity in that respect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Does the creature feature a triangular, transparent or glass-like panel in its upper section, matching the original building’s design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the creature does not exhibit a triangular, transparent, or glass-like panel. Such design elements are architectural and present in the building, but not replicated in the creature's form, indicating the absence of this particular feature.",
