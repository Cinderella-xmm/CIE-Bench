    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the central character (derived from the green block) positioned exactly in the middle of the composition, surrounded by other characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central green character is standing on a red block, with two red characters positioned on either side and slightly behind it. The visual cues and arrangement suggest this central character holds a focal position, being mid-scene and engaging with another human character kneeling in front. Therefore, it holds a central positioning, though not exactly geometrically centered as there seems to be more space on the left side of the composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the characters derived from the blocks retain the circular stud pattern on their upper surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character representing the green block, as well as the surface under it, has visible circular studs, characteristic of block toys like LEGO. The presence of these studs on the top surfaces implies a retention of this pattern. Thus, the design element from the original block is retained.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the characters derived from the blocks primarily composed of rectangular or boxy shapes, preserving the original block geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows characters with a boxy structure similar to the block's geometry. The green and red characters have cubic, box-shaped bodies, maintaining the geometric shape denoting a block's essence. Therefore, characters preserve rectangular or boxy shapes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the composition filled with a dense cluster of characters (originally blocks), arranged in a piled, overlapping manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Unlike Image A, where blocks are stacked and overlapped densely, Image B showcases a more spacious arrangement. The characters are spaced apart, with clear gaps among them and not densely clustered. This implies the composition is open and not piled or overlapping.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there only one character (derived from the green block) that differs in color or design from the surrounding characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), both green and red characters are present, all derived from blocks. However, the green character visually stands out among the two red characters; while the surrounding setup involves three main characters including a kneeling human, only the green block character significantly differs in color. Hence, the green block is the singular piece differing from the predominant red-themed setup.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the characters derived from the blocks retain any visual indication of interlocking mechanisms (such as recessed areas or connectors)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inspection of Image B reveals that the characters maintain block-like features, including the studs on their heads, similar to interlocking mechanisms seen in LEGO blocks. However, there are no visible recessed areas specifically in the animated characters themselves that suggest interlocking, unlike the block arrangements seen in Image A. Therefore, while stud patterns exist, distinct interlocking mechanisms are not visibly retained.",
