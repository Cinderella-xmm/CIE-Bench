    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the number \"7\" clearly visible on both the front fender and side panel of the motorcycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle is represented in a stylized, silhouette manner without visible details such as numbers on the fender or side panel. The focus is on artistic depiction rather than photorealistic details, with a silhouette of the rider and motorcycle against a dynamic background. Therefore, specific details like the number '7' are not discernible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the track outline labeled \"5/5\" present in the upper-right corner of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a track outline present in the upper-right corner, and it is labeled with '5/5'. This matches common graphic design elements used to indicate racing track information, and the label is clearly visible as part of the design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the dust trail originate directly from the rear wheel of the motorcycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle is depicted as a silhouette, and there is an artistically rendered trail or streak that could symbolize speed or movement. However, this does not appear to originate explicitly from the rear wheel as in a realistic depiction. Instead, it's part of an abstract design theme indicating motion.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the rider depicted in a forward-leaning posture with hands gripping the handlebars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rider's silhouette suggests a general riding posture, but specific details such as forward-leaning and hand placement on handlebars are not explicitly clear due to the artistic, abstract style. The silhouette implies general riding dynamics rather than specific posture details.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the front wheel circular with a blue rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front wheel of the motorcycle is part of a silhouette which does portray the circular shape of a wheel. However, the rim is not distinctly colored, as the artistic style focuses on the silhouette rather than specific color details. Hence, no blue rim is visible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the rider positioned in the foreground with the desert landscape behind them and the track outline in the upper-right corner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rider is presented in the foreground as a prominent silhouette against a dynamic background. The style suggests landscapes or backgrounds but isn't specific to a particular desert scenery. The track outline does appear in the upper-right corner, fitting a typical depiction of a racing context.",
