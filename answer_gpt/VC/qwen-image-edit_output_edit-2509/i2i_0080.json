      "question": "Does the dog retain its reddish-brown fur in both the left side and back views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's fur color is visually noticeable as reddish-brown on the main body visible from the left side view, when the dog is lying on the bed. Observing the back view, the same reddish-brown fur is evident on its rear side, confirming the fur color is consistent across both views. Combining this visual information with common knowledge about consistency in a subject's coloring, the dog's reddish-brown fur is retained in both the left side and back views.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the dog’s floppy ears present and maintained in shape in both views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, in the left side view, the floppy ears of the dog are clearly visible, adding to the dog's distinct features. In the back view, the ears are visible over the headboard of the bed, retaining the same floppy shape as seen from the side. By applying common knowledge that such features are generally consistent across different views of the same creature, the dog's floppy ears are present and maintained in shape in both views.",

      "question": "Is the dog wearing a red collar with a tag in both views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B's left side view, the dog is visibly wearing a red collar with a tag, which is apparent due to its distinct color against the reddish-brown fur. In the back view, despite not clearly seeing the tag, the red collar itself is discernible around the neck area. Common knowledge indicates that collars, once worn, continue to be visible regardless of viewing angle unless obscured. Thus, the dog wears the collar in both views.",

      "question": "Is the dog still lying on a wooden bed with a green mattress and pillow in both views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is clearly lying on a wooden bed with a green mattress and pillow in the left side view. The bed's wooden structure and green bedding are clearly visible from both the front (left) and rear (right) views, showing consistency in these objects across views due to their physical attributes known in real-world objects. Therefore, it is confirmed that the dog is lying on the same bed across both views.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the dog’s bed set against a pale blue background with green grass around it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting shows the dog on the bed against a pale blue background, which is consistently the case in both the left and back views. The green grass surrounding the bed is also visible in both views, indicating a continuity of the setting. Using world knowledge, settings like backgrounds and surface are consistent features unless specified otherwise. Thus, the pale blue background with green grass is evident around the bed in both views.",
