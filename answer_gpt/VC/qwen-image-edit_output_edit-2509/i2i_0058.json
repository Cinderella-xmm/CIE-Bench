      "question": "Does the edited subject (anthropomorphic bull) maintain the rightward walking posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the anthropomorphic bull is facing forward as indicated by the direction in which its body and head are aligned, suggesting it is walking towards the viewer. Image A features an elephant walking closely forward, similar to Image B. The reasoning involves understanding animal locomotion and spatial orientation cues based on visual depiction.",

      "question": "Is the saddle and seating arrangement for the riders preserved intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bull is equipped with armor, but details indicating a saddle specifically are not visible. The rider is seated directly on the bull's back, similar to horseback riding postures. In Image A, there is a visible saddle for the riders on the elephant. The analysis involves comparing seating arrangements typical for riding animals.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the riders still positioned directly atop the anthropomorphic bull, maintaining their original relative height from the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rider is positioned directly atop the bull, suggesting the same posture as the riders in Image A atop an elephant. Both images depict a riding scenario, though the actual height might differ due to differing animal sizes, which is based on typical depictions of animal riders, recognizing the differences between elephant and fictional bull riding.",

      "question": "Does the dirt path retain its uneven and natural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a path that is flat and has a scenic, illuminated appearance without visible stones, whereas Image A shows a visibly uneven dirt path with stones and variations typical for natural terrains. The analysis involves recognizing visual details and textures of outdoor terrains using the depicted scenario.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features foliage in the form of dense trees and leaves framing the sides of the path, similar to Image A where various trees and leaves frame the path. The comparison involves observing environmental settings depicted in both images, focusing on tree positioning and greenery presence along both paths.",
