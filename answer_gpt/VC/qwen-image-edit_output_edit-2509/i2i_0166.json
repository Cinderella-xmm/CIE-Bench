      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is displayed prominently with distinct characteristics. The analysis begins by identifying the color of the bird's feathers, which are a striking bright yellow. Additionally, the beak is of a vivid orange hue, which stands out against the yellow feathers. These visual cues are clear indicators of the bird's appearance. Therefore, the bird is indeed depicted with bright yellow feathers and an orange beak.",

      "question": "Does the bird have black eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the bird's eyes are clearly visible and appear to be black. The contrast between the yellow feathers and the bird's black eyes helps in identifying the eye color distinctly. Combining this visual information with common knowledge that many birds have dark eyes, it is apparent that the bird in the image has black eyes.",

      "question": "Is the bird perched on a thin branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird can clearly be seen standing on a branch. The branch does not appear thick or robust; rather, it is relatively narrow and slender compared to the size of the bird. This suggests that the branch is indeed thin, supporting the observation that the bird is perched on a thin branch.",

      "question": "Does the background have a natural setting with green hues and a bokeh effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B shows a diffused, soft appearance typical of a bokeh effect, which highlights the subject by blurring out background details. It is predominantly in green hues, suggesting foliage or a natural environment. The presence of a soft light further enhances the natural setting. These observations align with a natural backdrop having green hues and a bokeh effect.",

      "question": "Are the bird's feet visibly gripping the branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's feet are visible and show clear interaction with the branch. The feet appear to be clasped around the branch, demonstrating a gripping action, which is typical behavior for birds when perching. This visual detail confirms that the bird's feet are indeed visibly gripping the branch.",
