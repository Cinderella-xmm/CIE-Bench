      "question": "Are the two orange horn-like protrusions on the top of the robot's head present and unchanged in shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot features two distinct orange horn-like protrusions positioned atop its head. These protrusions appear to be in the same shape and position as those in Image A, indicating they have not been altered during editing. Upon examining Image A, the horns are similarly placed and shaped, supporting the conclusion that the edited image retains their original form and placement.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot’s chest in Image B prominently displays a red rectangular plate, which from visual inspection, appears consistent in size, shape, and position compared to Image A. The large red plate importantly defines the robot’s torso structure and remains unchanged in the edited version.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the robot’s feet retain their angular, blocky construction complete with black toe segments and distinct red accent plates near the ankles, similar to what is evident in Image A. This suggests no alterations in these foot components.",
