      "question": "Is the subject seated upright with the back supported by a chair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is seated in a chair with a straight posture. The back is positioned against the backrest of the chair, giving the appearance of being supported by it. This conclusion is drawn by observing the alignment of the subject’s torso with the chair's backrest, which typically indicates support.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the hands positioned together on the lap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hands are holding a quill and a piece of paper, exhibiting a writing gesture that suggests the hands are close together on the lap area. The position and orientation of the hands support the conclusion that they are together in front of the body, likely resting on the lap. This reasoning is based on the traditional posture of writing or holding items in a seated position.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the head positioned directly above the torso and centered in the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blurred area signifying the head is directly above the torso and symmetrically aligned within the frame of the image. This can be determined by the alignment of the head with the central axis of the body's posture, which typically results in a centered position within a portrait frame.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible armrest beneath the subject’s right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chair the subject is seated on has an armrest beneath the subject’s right hand. This is visible through the positioning of the hand resting near the edge of the chair, where the structure of a visible armrest typically appears in seating furniture.",
      "weight": 2,

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the arms bent at the elbows and resting along the sides of the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arms are bent at the elbows with the hands positioned in front of the body. The sleeves and positioning show that the elbows are bent and held close to the torso, a common way for arms to rest naturally along the sides in a seated, upright position.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the legs positioned symmetrically beneath the torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the legs and lower part of the body are partially obscured by the robe, the symmetrical and central positioning suggests the legs are positioned symmetrically beneath the torso. This is inferred from the balanced posture and straight alignment, which usually encompasses symmetrical leg positioning.",
