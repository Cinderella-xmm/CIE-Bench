    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the distinct network of wrinkles around the eyes and mouth of the elderly woman?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, a digital illustration style replaces the photographic detail that commonly includes features like wrinkles. Instead of photographic realism, the illustrated cards in Image B show simplified features typical of chibi or cartoon designs. Thus, any wrinkles from the original photographic image are absent in the edited version.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the silver-gray hair styled in a traditional updo with a clear central part and rounded bun at the back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image uses a stylized cartoon approach, which represents the woman’s hairstyle simplistically. Notably, the hair retains a depiction of traditional styling popularly seen in Hanbok culture—updo with a visible central part and bun, albeit in a simplified manner.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the white collar of the jeogori clearly visible and forming a V-shape at the neckline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration maintains a simplified representation of a Hanbok already seen with a white collar. Recognition of this traditionally involves a V-shaped neckline – observable even in the basic design approach seen in chibi art pieces.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a coral-colored ribbon bow located at the center of the chest, tied in a neat knot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited illustration, the coral-colored ribbon bow visible in the original image transfers to a stylized version at the figure’s chest center, retaining the tidily tied knot as visual symbolism within its animated representation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible floral embroidery patterns along the inner edge of the jeogori, featuring pink, purple, and red flowers on a greenish-gray background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustrative nature simplifies these embroidery patterns for space and style, opting for minimalism without rich, intricate detail evident in the original photographic image. Consequently, these specific embroidery markers are not individually discernible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the elderly woman standing upright and facing directly toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image opts for a front-facing orientation consistent with formal portrait styles, and popular in simplistic cartoon artworks. Thus, the woman appears upright and front-facing as anticipated in such artistic syntax.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the outer jeogori visibly layered over an inner garment, creating a translucent effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the edited illustrations lack photographic precision, they do present the concept of layered clothing through color variation and contouring that insinuates transparent or flowing outer layers over inner garments despite the lack of explicit translucent effects.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
