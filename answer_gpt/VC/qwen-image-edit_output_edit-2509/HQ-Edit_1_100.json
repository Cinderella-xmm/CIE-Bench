    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the green-shaded desk lamp present on the right side of the desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the desk lamp is not visible. The setting is an illustrated library environment without specific items such as lamps that might be seen in a real-life setting based on its artistic style. Hence, there's no indication of a desk lamp by employing visual cues and general knowledge about illustrated environments.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the vertical window with a grid pattern visible on the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists entirely of bookshelves without additional architectural features like windows. The style of the image indicates a more enclosed, book-focused illustration that might lack distinctive architectural elements commonly seen in real environments.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there an open book with yellowed pages on the desk in front of the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays an open book in front of the figure being illustrated, with detailed lined pages depicting the styled textual nature, but not necessarily yellowed pages. However, the concept of an open book can still visually match the context in similar illustrative styles.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are round wire-rimmed glasses visible on the figure’s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "No glasses are evident in Image B. The focus of illustrative style can often exclude detailed accessory elements unless specifically highlighted. Observational insights conclude that there aren't illustrated glasses on the figure's face.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the figure seated at the desk with her body leaning forward toward the open book?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration in Image B captures the figure in a seated position at the desk with a natural pose suggesting attentiveness toward the book, albeit in a typical upright seated posture as opposed to leaning forward. Illustrative insights determine the standard reading posture conveyed.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the desk made of wood with visible grain texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the desk appears stylized and lacks detailed texture to denote wood grain. It's a depiction that focuses on the overall thematic library setting rather than detailed material characteristics prominently in such illustrated renders.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there multiple stacked books located behind the main open book on the desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustrative setting in Image B concentrates primarily on the character and immediate interactions. Multiple stacked books are not visually depicted behind the main open book, focusing instead on the library shelves and immediate reading scenario typical of illustrated depictions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the figure’s dark hair styled in a bun with loose strands falling near the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the figure's hair styled neatly in a bun without loose strands. The hair is uniformly depicted, reflecting the controlled artistic portrayal of hairstyle where extraneous details like loose strands are often stylized or omitted.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
