    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the intricate iron lattice structure of the Eiffel Tower present, including its characteristic crisscross pattern and open framework?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the Eiffel Tower inside a snow globe model. The detailed lattice structure, characterized by the crisscross pattern and open framework, is visible and well-represented in this miniature version. This suggests an accurate representation of the tower's iconic design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the arched base of the Eiffel Tower visible, with a clear central passage beneath the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe model of the Eiffel Tower includes an arched base. Although simplified due to scale, a central passage is visible beneath the structure, capturing the key features of the original tower's design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the spire and crown structure at the very top of the Eiffel Tower present and clearly defined?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow globe in Image B includes a depiction of the Eiffel Tower with its peak. The spire and crown are visible, although scale limitations could limit definition. Nonetheless, the essential structure is well-represented in this miniature model.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the rows of lampposts and bare-branched trees symmetrically arranged along both sides of the central path leading to the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B's snow globe, lampposts and trees are arranged symmetrically along the pathway to the Eiffel Tower, matching the design described. This symmetry contributes to the structured beauty and miniature representation of the Parisian scene.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there figures in the foreground positioned facing the Eiffel Tower, with some appearing to take photographs or observe it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes figures positioned along the pathway facing the Eiffel Tower, some gesturing toward the tower as if observing or possibly photographing it. While figures are minimal due to scale, their placement and gestures suggest interaction with the tower.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the central pathway extend directly toward the Eiffel Tower, creating a strong linear perspective with convergence at the towerâ€™s base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow globe in Image B has a pathway leading directly to the Eiffel Tower, creating an effective linear perspective that converges at the base of the structure. This matches the visual effect typical of Parisian scenes with the tower as a focal point.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the ground fully covered in snow, with visible accumulation around the base of the tower and along the path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe interior shows the ground covered in snow, evident along the path and around the base of the Eiffel Tower. This detail is consistent with the wintry theme depicted in the miniature model.",
