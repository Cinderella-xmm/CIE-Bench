      "question": "Are there two vertically stacked pancake layers, with the bottom one slightly larger than the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pancake layers appear anthropomorphized with animated expressions and are not stacked in the traditional sense. Instead of two distinct vertically stacked layers, there are multiple pancakes present, arranged as part of a whimsical cartoon narrative. The arrangement does not conform to the description of the bottom layer being larger than the top one, as depicted traditionally in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the pancakes retain a dominant golden-yellow color throughout their visible surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the comic-style illustration of pancakes presents a dominant yellow-golden hue throughout the pancake illustrations. This visual cue aligns with typical cartoon depictions of pancakes which often emphasize vibrant colors for appeal and visibility, similar to the dominant golden-yellow coloration in Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a solid, rectangular pat of pale yellow butter placed on the top pancake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a stylized comic version of pancakes, which includes an animated pancake character rather than literal butter placement visible in reality. The focus shifts from individual cooking details, such as butter, to broader humorous storytelling, meaning the depiction of real butter as seen in Image A does not directly translate here.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible stream of amber-colored syrup flowing from a pitcher onto the pancakes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are numerous illustrations of syrup streams, emphasizing flow and action in a larger-than-life manner typical of cartoons. This differs from Image A, where syrup is poured precisely onto pancakes, showing an amber-colored syrup stream. Image B focuses more on dynamic streams for narrative effect.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the pancake stack placed on a white plate with a light blue rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pancakes in Image B are set within a colorful comic frame, where the details such as plate rims are stylized and part of the overall drawn composition, disconnected from real-world specifics. Contrary to Image A's actual plates with blue rims, Image B emphasizes exploratory visuals without clear rim delineation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the inner sides of the pancakes visibly porous and airy, showing a spongy texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the comic styling focuses on illustrative detail rather than representing real-world textures, foregoing intricate textures such as visible porous surfaces that are tangible in culinary depictions shown in Image A. The pancakes, animated with smooth surfaces, do not convey spongy textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the syrup stream originate from above the stack and flow downward onto the top pancake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents numerous dynamic syrup streams cascading around the pancake characters, showcasing exaggerated motion rather than a single stream originating from above, as seen in Image A. The comic environment enriches action and fluidity but diverges from singular pouring realism.",
