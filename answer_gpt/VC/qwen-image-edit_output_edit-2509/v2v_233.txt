    "Question": "Q5: Is the leaf oriented with the stem pointing toward the upper left and the blade extending diagonally across the frame?",
    "explanation": "The leaf in the edited image is oriented such that the stem points toward the upper left, and the blade extends diagonally across the frame. This positioning is consistent with the orientation observed in the original image, as the direction and placement of the leaf remain unchanged.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the leaf the sole central object in the edited image, without any other competing elements in the foreground?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the leaf is enclosed in a glass sphere, serving as a prominent focal point. However, the addition of the decorative elements like the glass sphere and the background setting reduces the exclusivity of the leaf as the sole central object. Unlike the original image, which features only the leaf on water, the edited image introduces additional visual elements.",
