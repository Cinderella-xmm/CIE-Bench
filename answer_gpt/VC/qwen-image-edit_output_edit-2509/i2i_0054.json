      "question": "Is the detailed texture of the elephant's skin, showing wrinkles and creases, preserved in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a banana placed on a stand against a plain background. There is no elephant visible in this image; thus, it is impossible to evaluate details such as wrinkles and creases on an elephant's skin from Image B.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the elephant's posture, including the raised front leg and curved trunk, retained in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B completely lacks an elephant. It displays a banana instead. Therefore, there is nothing in Image B to evaluate concerning an elephant's posture, raised front leg, or curved trunk.",

      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the elephant's ears and trunk, consistent with its young age, maintained in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no elephant present; only a banana is featured. Given this, characteristics such as an elephant's ears, trunk, or any reference to proportion related to age cannot be assessed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature an elephant or any rock surface. Instead, there is a banana. Thus, positioning of an elephant in relation to a rock, including its legs and trunk, cannot be determined or evaluated in Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no elephant to analyze in terms of orientation or profile direction. The content is solely comprised of a banana on a stand.",
