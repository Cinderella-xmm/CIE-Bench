      "question": "Are there two separate, cushioned backrest sections positioned side by side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backrest is illustrated as two cloud-like sections with eye-like features, which are positioned side by side, maintaining the appearance of separate cushions. The visual cues clearly show two distinct soft areas resembling a double backrest, typical of a two-seater sofa. Common knowledge suggests that the arrangement is for two people, thus reinforcing the observation of separate sections.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there two armrests, one on each side of the sofa, aligned with the seat cushions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two distinct wooden structures on either side of the main seating area, which resemble armrests in typical sofa design. These are artistically represented as part of the sofa's whimsical, cloud-like form, but they function as the armrest counterparts. Armrests typically align with the front and back cushions, as shown in the image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sofa have four legs, one at each corner of the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the sofa has four metal-tipped legs, positioned in each corner of the wooden framework supporting the cloud-like seating. This follows the conventional sofa structure, where four legs ensure stability.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sofa symmetrically arranged along a vertical centerline, with identical features on the left and right sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a symmetrical design with cloud-like features and wooden elements mirrored across a vertical centerline. Both sides contain similar armrests, backrest sections, and leg designs, indicating symmetry typical in conventional furniture design for aesthetic balance.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the seat cushions positioned directly beneath the backrest cushions, forming a continuous seating surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sofa's seating area, made of cloud-like material, continues seamlessly from the base cushion areas to the backrest cushions, maintaining the unified form found in typical sofa designs. This integration supports a continuous seating premise.",

      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A detailed inspection of Image B reveals no visible black circular fasteners. The artistic rendering of the sofa does not include these elements, contrasting the more practical, real-world design features that would typically secure furniture joints.",
