    "Question": "Q1: Does the sparrow retain its distinct brown, white, and black feather patterns?",
    "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the sparrow displays a visually distinct pattern of feathers that includes a combination of brown, white, and black colors. This is a common feather pattern for sparrows, which generally possess these colors for their plumage. To determine consistency, we check the same region in Image A, and observe that the sparrow maintains the same combination of colors and pattern. Therefore, the color consistency of the feathers in both images is evident.",
