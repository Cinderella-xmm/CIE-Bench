      "question": "Is the bindi present on the dancer's forehead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the forehead area is blurred and lacks clear detailing. Typically, a bindi is a small decorative mark worn on the forehead, often noticeable due to its contrasting color on the skin. However, in this image, it's not visible due to the blur effect, and hence appears absent.",

      "question": "Does the dancer have dark braided hair secured with decorative pins?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a dancer with intricate hair ornamentation, typical of traditional dance costumes. Although the fine details of the hair are obscured, the presence of decorative elements like pins or embellishments is common. However, the actual braid detail isn't visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a white floral garland on the left side of the dancer's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no distinct white floral garland visible on the dancer's head. Commonly, a white floral garland would have a distinct appearance made up of multiple small, round flowers. Such an adornment is not perceptible in the image.",

      "question": "Is there a golden ornament placed at the crown of the dancer's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given the traditional element of a golden ornament often featured in dance attire, it commonly sits prominently at the crown of the head. However, in Image B, due to the blur and lack of explicit visibility, such an ornament isn't distinctly identified.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is captured in a frontal view of the body, as the shoulders and torso face forward rather than to the side. Therefore, the dancer is not in a side profile.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dancer holding a pose where the right leg is extended outward rather than elevated with a bent knee and foot pointed downward, which reflects a classical dance stance with both feet generally on the floor.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's posture is primarily upright and balanced, with a slight twist suggesting fluidity but without an elevated leg or significant bending. The stance appears stable with both feet grounded.",
