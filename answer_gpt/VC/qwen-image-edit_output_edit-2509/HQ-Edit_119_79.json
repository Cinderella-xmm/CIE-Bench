      "question": "Is the calico pattern of orange, black, and white patches preserved in the same spatial arrangement across the cat’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, analyzing the cat's pattern, we see a similar calico pattern composed of orange, black, and white patches. This pattern appears natural and typical for a calico cat, suggesting that these colors have been preserved across the body in a comparable arrangement to what one would expect from such a cat. While specific patch positions might differ slightly upon detailed comparison with Image A, without direct alignment, it visually maintains the calico attribute. Thus, the spatial arrangement seems preserved in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the eyes still green and positioned symmetrically in the center of the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat’s eyes are bright green, positioned symmetrically and centrally on the face, suggesting that these features have been preserved in the edited image as well.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cat in an upright seated position with both front paws placed directly in front of the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is in an upright seated position, as evidenced by the posture of its body—the front paws visibly positioned directly in front, touching the surface, indicating the upright seated arrangement.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the pink nose present at the center of the face, surrounded by white fur on the muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a pink nose at the center of the cat's face, surrounded by white fur. This indicates a conservation of these features at that precise location.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the cat appears to be seated on a different type of surface with a wooden appearance, supporting its weight fully—acting as a base. While the surface material might vary, the concept of a block-like support underneath the cat remains consistent.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tail of the cat in Image B is observed curving to the right side with alternating orange and black bands, consistent and harmonic with its body’s pattern, indicating that the tail positioning and pattern are preserved.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both ears are depicted as upright and pointed forward, symmetrically placed on the top of the cat's head, preserving their overall positioning.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of a conventional white fluffy fur area, the chest displays transparent crystalline features. This indicates the absence of a notably large fluffy-looking area extending from the neck to the front paws as it appears altered to look like crystal, replacing the original fur aspect.",
