        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is shown with her hands submerged in the barrel, appearing to be engaged in washing or scrubbing an item, which could be fabric. However, she is not visibly in the act of placing fabric into the barrel since her hands are inside it, suggesting she is either washing or manipulating the fabric rather than initially placing it.",
