    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the overall shape of each earring a symmetrical, elongated feather with pointed tips at both ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects displayed are two cartoonish representations of characters with feather-like bodies, but they are not intended to represent earrings. These characters have feathers with rounded tips at the bottom rather than pointed tips, indicating that the shapes are not symmetric elongated feathers with pointed tips at both ends.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does each earring contain a centrally located oval black stone set within a metallic bezel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters have oval bodies, but these do not contain a black stone set within a metallic bezel; instead, their bodies are colored in cartoon style with various hues and patterns. The original function as earrings and the design with a black stone are abandoned in a cartoon context.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there fine, parallel engraved lines extending outward from the central spine on both sides of the feather?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts animated characters with feather-like designs, but these designs do not include fine engraved lines emanating from a central spine as traditional feather earrings would. The cartoon style depicts a textured design but does not mimic realistic engraving typically found on metallic jewelry.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the metal of the earrings rendered in a silver tone with a matte or slightly oxidized (antiqued) finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The characters in Image B are not rendered as earrings and do not display a metallic silver tone or any finish indicative of an antiqued look. They are in bright, cartoon colors with no metallic appearance, reflecting the change from a realistic object to a comic character. Therefore, the overall metallic aspect is not present.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does each earring include a curved hook earwire connected via a small spherical bead to the main feather body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoon characters in Image B do not have features resembling the curved hook earwire or small spherical bead attachment integral to earrings. Instead, they have exaggerated feather-like designs with animated faces and do not display anything similar to earring findings.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the two earrings identical in shape, size, and orientation, mirrored across a vertical axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents cartoon figures that have different shapes and designs on their bodies and faces. Despite the similar theme, the feathers' orientation and shape are not uniformly mirrored on any axis, departing from a static and mirrored appearance typical of identical earrings.",
