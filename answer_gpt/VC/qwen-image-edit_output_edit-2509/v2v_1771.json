        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Leaning Tower of Pisa is depicted with its signature lean to the right, preserving its well-known tilt, based on how the main structure inclines away from vertical. This is consistent with how the tower appears in reality, famously leaning due to a settling foundation.",
