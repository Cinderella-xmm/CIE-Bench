    "Question": "Q1: Are the gorilla’s eyes golden-yellow in color?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the facial region of the gorilla, including its eyes, is covered and blurred out. Due to this, no specific discernment can be made regarding the color of the gorilla's eyes. As we can't observe the eyes' color to determine if they are golden-yellow, the correct choice is based on the inability to confirm such a detail.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is there a prominent silver-colored crest on the top of the gorilla’s head?",

It mainly shows the gorilla's dense, dark fur without evidence of a silver-colored crest.",
