      "question": "Is the herringbone wood inlay pattern present on the surface of the transformed character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed character is depicted wearing an ornate robe with intricate patterns, but there is no visible herringbone wood inlay pattern as observed on the original cabinet in Image A. The original cabinet featured this pattern on its drawers and sides, but in the transformation, the character's surface does not retain or replicate this specific wood design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the circular brass ring pulls and adjacent escutcheons present on the transformed character’s waist area, matching their original positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the character has decorative elements such as a belt and a robe, but there are no circular brass ring pulls and escutcheons visible on the waist. The original cabinet in Image A visibly featured these components on its drawer fronts. However, the character does not retain or mimic these hardware details in the corresponding region.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the transformed character retain the original warm amber-brown wood color as the base tone of its body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base color of the transformed character is not the warm amber-brown wood tone that was dominant in the original cabinet's structure in Image A. Instead, the character's base color is obscured by the colorful robe, and its visible areas do not exhibit this specific wood tone.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the transformed character has feet resembling claws with no brass caps at their ends. In contrast, the original cabinet's legs in Image A had small brass caps at the bottom. This characteristic is not carried over to the transformed form.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's legs are not present; instead, it has clawed feet. The original cabinet in Image A had tapered legs, but this feature is not retained in the character's design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed character features pockets or pouches on the robe, which bear a resemblance to the original drawer stacking of the cabinet found in Image A. These pouches appear to be positioned in a vertical manner on the character’s body, mimicking the original drawer configuration.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the transformed character (Image B), there is no visible brass foliate motif on the side of the torso. The original cabinet (Image A) displayed this motif prominently on its sides. This decorative element is not shown on the transformed character.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In analyzing Image B, the transformed character wears a crown that does not retain the semi-circular edge shape of the original marble top from Image A. The crown is distinctively crown-shaped and decorated with jewels, diverging from the original semi-circle design.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the pouches on the character's robe appear to have a dark interior, suggesting depth, similar to how the original cabinet's open drawers (in Image A) would look. This suggests that the aspect of depth has been retained in the transformation.",
