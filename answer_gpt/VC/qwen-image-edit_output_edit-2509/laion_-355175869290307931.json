      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the chevron quilting pattern present on the front panel of the bag, forming a series of diagonal V-shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which appears to be a stylized illustration, the front panel of the bag shows lines forming V-shapes. In illustrations, even simplified representations aim to capture recognizable features, similar to quilting patterns visible through such repetitive detailing. This hints at an implied chevron pattern.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there gold-colored zippers located horizontally across the front pocket and vertically along the side panels of the bag?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, being an illustration, depicts simple lines and colored elements to mimic zipper elements. Only a horizontal line is visible, representing the front zipper, but not enough information to ascertain vertical side zippers, which doesn't imply their presence.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration in Image B depicts a central emblem above a horizontal line (representing a zipper), but clear signage or text details are not visible. Without visible words, one cannot confidently confirm the presence or style.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bag's illustration in Image B features two prominently visible handles, a typical hue of black in contrast, likely attached at the top with hint-like details of colored connections resembling metallic hardware.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a strap can be discerned alongside smaller elements suggesting attachment, though detailed coloring for metal or confirmation of D-rings isnâ€™t overtly clear in illustrations.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the bag maintain a rectangular shape with slightly rounded corners and a flat base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The general shape depicted in Image B, with illustrated contours and corners, supports a geometric, rectangular impression. Even stylized, illustrations try to maintain key structural elements, suggesting usability akin to full angles rather than flat corners.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the brand plaque located directly above the horizontal front zipper, with the zipper positioned below it and centered on the front panel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks detailed close-ups or distinctive text and markings necessary to identify a specific branded tag on zippers or pulls. Illustrations simplify features, often omitting delicate elements.",
