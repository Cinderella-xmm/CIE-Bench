        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B indicate that the figure still has a wig that is similar in appearance to traditional white powdered wigs with tightly curled sides, as indicated by the white curls visible beneath the tricorne hat.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's right hand is extended forward and holding an intricate instrument, with the grip being evident as the thumb and fingers are wrapped around the object.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's left hand is positioned near the lower torso, and the palm orientation is consistent with being inward or downward, similar to a natural resting position when the arm is slightly bent.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features cannot be evaluated due to the blurred area where the face is present, making it impossible to determine the consistency with the original depiction. As no facial details can be observed, the previous description is no longer applicable.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of the figure indeed appears to be in a three-quarter view. The body is angled such that it faces slightly to the viewerâ€™s right, which is consistent with a three-quarter pose where part of the chest and side are visible, commonly used in portraiture to give depth.",
