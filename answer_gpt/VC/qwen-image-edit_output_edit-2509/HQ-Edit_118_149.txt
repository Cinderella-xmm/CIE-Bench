    "Question": "Q1: Is the dancer’s left leg extended vertically upward in a full arabesque, with the right foot en pointe?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi representations on the stickers show the dancer's left leg lifted high and her right foot supporting her body. However, the chibi style simplifies and exaggerates certain features and motions, so the accuracy of an arabesque cannot be confirmed solely based on these stickers. Given the artistic representation, it is highly possible that some traditional ballet positions have been abstracted and simplified.", 
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are both feet wearing pink pointe shoes with visible ribbons wrapped around the ankles?",
    "explanation": "Image B features chibi stickers of two dancers, one of whom is depicted in a light pink outfit; however, the simplified and stylized nature of the stickers makes it difficult to confirm the exact details of the footwear. Although the original image had pink pointe shoes with ribbons, the abstract design of the stickers doesn't explicitly showcase the detailed features such as ribbons.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the dancer’s hair styled into a tight, round bun at the top of her head?",
    "explanation": "Within Image B, the dancers in the stickers have their hair depicted as round buns on the top of their heads. This corresponds with traditional ballet styles where dancers often sport tight buns to keep hair secure during performances.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the dancer wear a sleeveless, fitted pink leotard paired with white tights?",
    "explanation": "The sticker in Image B on the left side displays a dancer in a simplified representation wearing a pink leotard, and the overall visual cues suggest the stylized depiction likely represents ballet attire. However, being a chibi sticker, it doesn't specifically indicate white tights due to the abstract design format.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is one arm extended forward and slightly out to the side, while the other grips the barre?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, being chibi stickers, both dancers are not depicted interacting with a barre, nor are their arms indicated in such a naturalistic position due to stylized representation. The artistic transformation does not permit the same level of interaction detail as realistic imagery.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the dancer facing to the right side of the image, with her body in a side profile view?",
    "explanation": "Within Image B, the dancer is represented in a sideways pose that indicates a facing direction; however, due to the artistic and abstract representation of the chibi stickers, the accurate direction faced and side profile are not explicit as in the realistic portrayal in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is there a visible seam running down the center back of the leotard?",
    "explanation": "In the abstract chibi sticker representation in Image B, details such as the seam on clothing are typically not included due to the stylized nature, focusing more on key shapes and outlines than intricate clothing construction details.",
    "answer": "No"
