      "question": "Is the subject's arms-raised pose preserved in the chibi-style figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figure is depicted with both arms raised in a gesture typically associated with excitement or celebration, which is a common pose in chibi art to convey a joyful emotion. This can be observed through the positioning of the arms away from the body and the expression of delight on the figure's face, suggesting that the pose has been preserved.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the multiple plates of burgers, fries, and drinks still present on the table in the same positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figure is depicted with multiple burgers and a serving of fries on the table. However, the exact number of items and their arrangement may not exactly match those in Image A, where several distinct plates with burgers and fries, along with drinks, are visible. Therefore, although burgers and fries are present, the exact positions and count are not mirrored.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the table still circular with a blue surface and metallic edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B represents a simplistic cartoon-style interpretation and the table is not depicted with the same level of detail found in Image A. Instead of detailed blue and metallic features, the focus is more on the food items and the chibi character. The presence of a circular table is not apparent with distinct color or metallic edge.",

      "question": "Is the red booth surrounding the subject still visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style depiction omits any booth surrounding the figure. The focus is solely on the character and the food items, with a plain background that does not feature or hint at a booth. This suggests that the surrounding booth from Image A is not present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the chibi-style illustration seen in Image B, the figure is portrayed with a widely smiling mouth and closed eyes in an arch, typical features used in such art styles to convey an expression of happiness or cheerfulness.",
