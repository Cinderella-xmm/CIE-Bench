    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the zebra retain its black and white stripe pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's body retains the distinctive black and white stripes that are characteristic of zebras. This is evident from the visual cues where the stripes are clearly visible across the zebra's body, including the torso and legs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the zebra's body structure, including its legs and torso, intact?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "The zebra's body in Image B appears complete and unchanged in its natural form. The structure, including the legs and torso, is consistent with that of an intact zebra, visible through the proper display of the limbs and overall body shape.",

      "model_answer": "yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the watering hole still present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the zebra interacting with the watering hole by seemingly consuming its contents. The presence of water and the splashes made by the zebra ensure the watermark is still present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the surrounding rocks and dry earth background still visible?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the natural environment depicted in Image A, including the dry earth and the rock formation near the zebra. These elements provide context for the zebra's location and are visibly similar to Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the zebra's tail retain its natural shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the zebra's tail in a natural position in line with its usual behavior; it's elevated and slightly arched with stripes typical of zebra tails. The appearance and position suggest a consistency with the natural tail motion.",

      "model_answer": "yes",
