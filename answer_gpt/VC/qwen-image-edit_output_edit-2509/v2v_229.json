        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bed is illustrated as the prominent feature within a square frame, drawing attention with its size and central positioning. It maintains its status as the main element in the composition, much like in Image A where the bed is the focal point of the bedroom setup.",

        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) uses specific artistic color choices, such as light yellows and oranges around the lamp and candles, to simulate a warm atmosphere, suggesting ambient warmth akin to the glow seen in Image A, where the room is lit with a warm, soothing light.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses flat color planes and simple shapes to abstractly represent the scene, which does not effectively convey textures as real as in Image A, where the bedding appears soft and plush due to detailed texture and shading.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are three pillows placed against the headboard, similar to Image A where pillows are aligned likewise. The arrangement is fairly consistent between both images, retaining this key aspect of the setup.",
