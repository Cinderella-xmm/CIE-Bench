    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the text \"MICHAEL KORS\" present in uppercase letters below the 12 o'clock position on the dial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's face is drawn to resemble a clock. The portion resembling the '12 o'clock' has text that appears to be altered or creatively drawn, suggesting that it's a parody or artistic depiction rather than a literal watch face. However, the text 'MICHAEL KORS' attempting to mimic a brand is still visible amid the comic style of the representation. Despite being non-standard from a literal watch face, the impression of those words is evident, which aligns with the idea of a parody or imitation.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there three subdials located at the 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions, with the 3 o'clock subdial marked 24-hour scale, the 6 o'clock subdial marked seconds, and the 9 o'clock subdial marked minutes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is more on the exaggerated and comical features of the watch-face character rather than functional details like subdials. The artwork does not depict any subdials at these positions that align with standard watch subdial functions, focusing instead on a whimsical design. Therefore, these detailed subdial functionalities described are not present.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a rectangular date window at the 4 o'clock position showing the number \"18\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, it is clear that the style is cartoonish with a character having a watch face for a head. No specific date window equivalent is depicted in this artistic style, nor is the number '18' visibly marked anywhere around the area traditionally known as the 4 o'clock position in watches.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the watch have a black leather strap with an embossed crocodile texture and visible stitching along the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch strap-like element is indeed present as part of the character design. It is presented with a texture resembling black leather with a design similar to crocodile embossing and appears to have stitches, maintaining some degree of realistic detail appropriate for a parody illustration.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the watch case and dial finished in a silver metallic tone with a brushed texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The artistic depiction in Image B lacks realistic color detail and instead uses grayscale and comic-like strokes. Due to its comic style, silver metallic tone and brushed texture cannot be confirmed visually, as the focus is on cartoon expression rather than precise material representation.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a continuous minute track around the outer edge of the dial with markings from 5 to 60?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's watch face does not contain the minute track typically found on a watch face. Instead, it is an exaggerated comic drawing focusing on characterization rather than functional or detailed watch components.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the numbers 12, 2, 4, 8, and 10 displayed as Arabic numerals at their respective positions on the dial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B has a face that mimics a clock dial with irregular numbers possibly but not consistently placed. While the numbers might resemble the ones mentioned, their comic representation may not strictly correspond with the specific placement and styling typical of a functioning watch.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there two pushers and a crown located on the right side of the watch case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the character's face includes design elements resembling pushers and a crown on the right side of what would be the 'watch case' â€” implying an attempt to maintain the illusion of a watch-head character. While the exaggeration and humor of the presentation deviate from true technical accuracy, these features are artistically included.",
