      "question": "Are the industrial structures still positioned on the left side of the image, maintaining their relative arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the industrial structures are visible on the left side of the image. They retain their relative arrangement, characterized by the series of rectangular and geometric shapes that are typical of industrial buildings. The structures are distinguishable from the rest of the scene due to their architectural style and positioning on the hillslope, which is consistent with their placement in Image A. Despite the stylized, artistically vibrant rendition, the spatial relationship and placement remain unchanged from a typical landscape view.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the road still curve gently through the valley, connecting the industrial area to the rest of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the road is clearly depicted as a continuous curved line meandering through the valley, starting from the industrial area and extending towards the right. This suggests a path that connects the industrial zone with other parts of the valley, consistent with the depiction in Image A. The flow of the road is integral to both Image A and B as it guides the viewerâ€™s eye through the landscape.",

      "question": "Are there still frosted trees visible along the sides of the valley?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized depiction transforms the trees into swirling patterns but retains the indication of their presence along the valley sides. The blue and white hues mimic the appearance of frost-covered trees, albeit in an artistic manner. Observing Image A helps confirm that these are consistent with the frosted trees originally present, emphasizing their continued presence in the edited image.",

      "question": "Are the distant snow-covered peaks still visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features stylized mountain peaks with swirling patterns representing snow and sky, replacing realism with artistic abstraction. These peaks retain a prominent vertical form and placement on the horizon, indicative of the original snow-covered peaks seen in Image A. The edited image maintains the compositional integrity of the landscape by preserving this geographical feature.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the industrial structures still retain their general shape and form despite artistic modifications?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the industrial structures' basic geometrical shapes and arrangement are maintained, despite the transformation to a stylized artistic form. This artistic interpretation features exaggerated lines and curves typical of a 'Starry Night' style but does not alter the original essence of the structures visible in Image A. The recognition of their structural purpose is evident, suggesting retention of their general shape and form.",
