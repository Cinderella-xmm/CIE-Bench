    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the tan and white fur pattern, including the white blaze on the face and chest patch, present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse maintains a tan fur pattern similar to Image A, with a white blaze on its face as well as a white patch on its chest. This matches the color scheme found in Image A, indicating the pattern has been retained in the edited image.",

    },
    {

      "question": "Are the dark brown mane and tail present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While analyzing Image B, the mane and tail show a similar dark brown color as depicted in Image A. Therefore, it can be inferred that the mane and tail have been retained in their existing dark brown color.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the brown fabric bridle with a wooden handle present on the horse’s head in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse has a representation of a bridle when converted to cartoon form. This implies a cartoon stylization of the original fabric bridle from Image A, maintaining its presence in the edited image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the four dark brown wheels attached to the legs of the horse present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon resembles the horse toys with wheels similar to Image A. The presence of wheels in the lower parts of the horse in both images confirms that they are retained.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks the brand name ‘Rockin’ Rider’ as clearly visible in Image A. While the horse’s rocking base is similarly colored light brown, branding visibility isn't present in the edited image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white blaze is shown prominently on the horse's face, as is the white patch on the chest, aligning with the original depiction in Image A. Thus, both elements are clearly visible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited horse character in Image B doesn’t visibly show the detailed red and yellow logo present in Image A on the left ear, as such details are not featured in the cartoon representation.",
