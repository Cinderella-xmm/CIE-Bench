      "question": "Is the frisbee visible in mid-air between the two individuals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, between the two individuals, there is a disc-shaped object in the air, which matches the shape and visual characteristics of a frisbee. This suggests that the frisbee is indeed visible between them, demonstrating an action of play.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does one individual have their arm extended forward, as if throwing the frisbee?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stance of the individuals suggests one has their arms slightly forward, but not fully extended in a throwing motion. More likely, both seem to be ready to interact with an airborne frisbee, rather than one being in a definitive throwing stance.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the other individual have both hands raised, prepared to catch the frisbee?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both individuals seem to have their arms raised, showing intention to interact with the airborne frisbee. The stance and positioning of their hands suggest they are prepared to make a catch rather than engage in another action, like throwing.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scenery behind the characters is filled with trees creating a backdrop consistent with a park-like setting. The presence of numerous trees verifies that they are indeed present in the background.",

      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The attire of both individuals in Image B is depicted as white shirts and casual jeans, which aligns with everyday casual clothing rather than sport-specific attire, indicating they are dressed in non-athletic, common casual outfits suitable for general outdoor leisure.",
