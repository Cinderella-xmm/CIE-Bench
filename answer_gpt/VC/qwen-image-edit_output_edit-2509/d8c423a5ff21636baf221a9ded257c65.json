      "question": "Are two stone columns visible on the left and right sides of the background, framing the landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background does not include stone columns framing the landscape. Instead, the background appears to be a painted scene with architectural detailing but lacks columns that frame the landscape like in classic portrait settings. World knowledge tells us that portraits of this nature often have prominent vertical elements framing the subject, which are absent here.",
