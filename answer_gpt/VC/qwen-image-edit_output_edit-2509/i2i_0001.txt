    "Question": "Q1: Does the chibi keychain feature a large, singular pearl earring on the girl's left ear?",
    "explanation": "In the chibi keychain image (Image B), the visual cues show a simplified representation of the earring area, which does not clearly depict a large pearl earring as seen in classic artworks. The chibi style usually simplifies details, and here it appears as a small dot or absence of detailed jewelry. Thus, it does not feature a large, singular pearl earring based on typical chibi representations.",
