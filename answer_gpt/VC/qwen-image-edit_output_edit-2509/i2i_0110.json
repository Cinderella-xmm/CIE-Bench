      "question": "Are the thick, textured brushstrokes of the original painting retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture of the brushstrokes is completely absent. Instead of the thick, textured brushstrokes seen in Image A, Image B presents a digitally smooth rendering. The smoothness and lack of visible brushstroke texture are characteristic of digital images and differ from the distinctive painting style evident in Image A's brushstrokes, which belong to Van Gogh’s painting technique.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the bright golden yellow color of the sunflowers preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sunflowers in Image B retain a vibrant golden yellow hue similar to that in Image A. This hue reflects the iconic sunflowers depicted in Van Gogh's painting, showcasing their bright and lively color despite differences in medium and style between the two images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the off-white and yellow color of the vase, including the handwritten signature \"Vincent,\" retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a plain white vase without the signature 'Vincent' or the off-white and yellow hues seen in Image A. Image A features an artistically distinct vase with a signature, which is part of Van Gogh’s artistic identity. However, Image B has opted for a simplistic design, lacking these artistic details.",

    {

      "question": "Are the sunflowers positioned in the vase as they were originally, maintaining their natural arrangement and angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the orientation and arrangement of sunflowers similar to Image A, with a comparable number and angling of the flowers despite differences that may result from stylistic adaptation in 3D rendering. The positioning in Image B replicates the natural orientation seen in the painting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the green color and arrangement of leaves and stems akin to those in Image A. While the texture is adapted due to the digital illustration format, the color and placement reflect the natural arrangement introduced by Van Gogh in Image A.",
