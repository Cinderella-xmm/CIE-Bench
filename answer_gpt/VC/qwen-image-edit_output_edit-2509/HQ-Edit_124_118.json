    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the central waterfall positioned vertically in the middle of the image, descending from the upper cliff to the river below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts illuminated renderings of waterfalls and trees, where the waterfalls are centered and flow vertically down a cliff, as they do in typical waterfall imagery. Analyzing this along with common representations of waterfalls, one can confirm the position of the central waterfall vertically in the middle of Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a large, curved tree on the left side of the image with a diagonal branch extending upward and bearing clusters of small purple flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases digital trees with a glowing spiral motif, unlike natural trees bearing flowers depicted in Image A. Based on the edited look and lack of flower-like details in Image B, the specific arrangement described does not exist.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the river originate in the foreground and curve toward the base of the central waterfall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features futuristic panels displaying river and waterfall images, but the physical orientation and curving of a river from the foreground toward the waterfall base aren't clearly discernible as in natural scenery. The edited image simulates river flow but doesn't provide a direct curvature originating from the foreground to the waterfall base.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible rocks scattered along the riverbed in the foreground and midground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a futuristic setting with holographic-style visuals that depict elements like waterfalls and forest, excluding concrete foreground and midground details such as rocks. Rocks are common in natural riverbeds, but given the digital nature of the edited scene, this detail is absent.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there two smaller waterfalls visible on the right-hand cliff face, behind the main waterfall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, several waterfalls are portrayed on the panels with glowing outlines, yet specific positioning on a right-hand cliff face isn't discernibly detailed as it would be in a natural setting. The digital representation diverges from geographic specification.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a dense canopy at the top of the image with sunlight streaming through gaps, creating bright patches on the foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B provides a futuristic visual with luminous tree designs. However, it lacks a canopy with sunlight interaction evident in Image A, and instead, uses glowing lights as a feature. The portrayal does not reflect sunlight streaming or canopy structure.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there small purple flowers growing on the left side of the twisted tree, near the base of its branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B projects a digital composition with glowing trees that don't inherently include organic details such as flowers. World knowledge of futuristic imagery focuses on illuminated features instead of commonplace flora observed in natural settings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there multiple mountain ridges receding into the background, fading into a hazy blue sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of panels likely housed in an indoor environment, introducing digitally rendered scenes, and excludes naturally occurring mountain ridges fading into the sky as seen in Image A. The setting does not provide realistic mountain ridge details.",

      "model_answer": "No",
