      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which features Chibi-style characters, each character still appears to be interacting with travel-related items such as suitcases and backpacks.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Chibi-style characters maintain a consistent depiction wearing clothing similar to that found in travel scenarios—such as jackets and casual attire, which is typical for travel.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Chibi-style illustrations depict characters in various travel-related postures and actions. These include holding maps, examining luggage, and standing as if waiting or preparing for departure—all indicative of travel-related activities. This mirrors the actions visible in Image A, where individuals are clearly engaged in similar activities, such as standing by a train and holding bags.",

      "question": "Are the specific types of luggage, such as suitcases and backpacks, still recognizable in their Chibi form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, even though the characters have been transformed into Chibi-style illustrations, the types of luggage, such as suitcases and backpacks, remain easily identifiable. This is achieved through simplified but clear representation of these items, which are consistent with how they are typically depicted in cartoons or illustrations. These items hold recognizable features, such as handles and rolling wheels, commonly associated with travel bags.",

      "question": "Do the characters retain enough visual detail in their Chibi form to be recognizable as the same individuals from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite being transformed into simplified Chibi forms, the characters have enough detail to imply continuity with Image A. This is achieved through consistent elements such as hairstyle, attire (jackets and jeans), and the presence of similar travel-related props, which help maintain identification with the original characters, albeit in a stylized form.",
