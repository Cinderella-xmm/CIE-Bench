      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there exactly four rotor assemblies arranged symmetrically around the central body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we can observe a robotic figure with rotor assemblies on its hands. Given common design patterns, it seems to mirror the design of a drone with four rotor assemblies. This is based on the symmetry seen in drone designs where rotors are evenly distributed around the body for balance during flight. Thus, the pattern suggests four rotor assemblies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there yellow triangular markings present on the top and side surfaces of the central body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robotic character features yellow markings seen on its armor, correlating with typical drone designs where such accent colors are used for aesthetics or visibility. Thus, combining world knowledge about typical drone design aesthetics and the visual cues leads to the conclusion of yellow triangular markings.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the landing supports shaped like V-forms at each corner of the drone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a humanoid figure without explicit landing supports, consistent with its animated style, which transforms the original drone features into more stylized representations. Therefore, the lack of clear V-shaped landing supports, as seen commonly in typical drones, leads to the conclusion.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the central body feature sharp, angular edges and a polygonal structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central body of the humanoid figure in Image B displays strong lines and edges consistent with a polygonal structure, often seen in futuristic or robotic designs. These sharp edges mirror typical designs in drones where angular edges lend a more technical and advanced appearance.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there three small rectangular lights aligned horizontally on the top surface of the central body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is a humanoid robotic creation, and it doesn't present explicit drone lighting. The visual emphasis is on the robot itself, without clear indications of small rectilinear lights as might appear on machinery or vehicles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the drone predominantly black with yellow accent markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B is primarily colored in black armor with noticeable yellow accents. This color scheme matches with the typical aesthetic design of some drones, where black is used as the primary color, complemented by yellow for contrast and visibility.",
