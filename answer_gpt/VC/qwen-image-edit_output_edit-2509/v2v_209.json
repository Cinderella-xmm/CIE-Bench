      "question": "Are the curved rockers at the base of the chair present and clearly defined?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, we can see the curved rockers extending at the base of the chair, forming the typical crescent shape associated with rocking chairs. This detail is clearly and sharply delineated, making it evident and well-defined in the illustration.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the back of the chair composed of multiple vertical spindles arranged between the top and bottom rails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the back of the chair features several vertical spindles, evenly spaced, between a defined top rail and bottom rail, which is a common design in traditional rocking chairs. These spindles are clearly shown and help communicate the structure of the chair's back.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows armrests that have a slight curve and are attached to the front legs via turned supports. These supports are visually distinguishable and positioned correctly to offer structural support, which matches the typical design of rocking chairs.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spherical finials are shown at the top of the two upright back posts in Image B, serving both an ornamental and structural role. These finials are clearly depicted and are a recognizable characteristic commonly found on rocking chair designs.",

      "question": "Does the chair maintain its original proportions, with a tall back, curved seat, and balanced leg structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the proportions similar to Image A, with a tall back supported by spindles, a subtly curved seat, and a leg structure that appears balanced for stability. The overall silhouette and proportions are consistent with those one would expect in a traditional rocking chair design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the continuous curved rockers are directly connected to the front legs, forming the rocking mechanismâ€™s base typical to rocking chairs. This connection is crucial for the rocking motion and is depicted correctly in the image.",
