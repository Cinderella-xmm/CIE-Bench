      "question": "Is the spiky, multi-tiered golden crown with a central peak and ornamental base present on the elephant’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant within the glass case is adorned with a spiky, multi-tiered golden crown on its head, characterized by a central peak and ornamental base. My analysis involved observing the intricate design elements and understanding typical characteristics of royal headdresses from historical and cultural depictions. Given these observations, the crown is indeed present on the elephant’s head.",

      "question": "Is the elaborate golden chest armor with overlapping plates and intricate geometric/floral patterns present on the elephant’s torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the elephant wearing an elaborate golden chest armor with overlapping plates and intricate geometric/floral patterns on its torso. My analysis combined visual observation of the rich detailing and design as evident on traditional ceremonial or royal armor. This confirms the presence of such armor on the elephant.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are golden bands present around all four legs of the elephant, positioned just above the hooves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, golden bands can be seen around each of the elephant's four legs, located just above the hooves. My reasoning included examining the placement and material consistency, which is typical for decorative armor or adornments. Thus, golden bands are indeed present on the elephant’s legs.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the elephant’s trunk curled upward in a distinct spiral shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's trunk is extending forward and slightly downward, rather than curled upwards in a distinct spiral shape. By considering typical trunk movements and reviewing the image, it is clear that the trunk does not exhibit a spiral shape.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the right tusk protruding from the elephant’s upper jaw, beside the trunk. This observation relies on visually identifying the distinct ivory tusk typical of elephants, which is visible and protruding in the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant’s ears are positioned outward in a partially fanned manner but not completely extended laterally. By analyzing typical anatomical positioning and movement of elephant ears, it is evident that the ears aren't fully fanned out as described.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows visible wrinkles on the elephant's trunk, areas around the eyes, and joint areas of the legs. This is determined by examining the textural details, which align with common anatomical features of an elephant's skin, indicating the presence of wrinkles.",
