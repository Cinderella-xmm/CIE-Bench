    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the central archway positioned at the center of the main structure, forming a passageway between the two vertical pillars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central archway is not distinctly visible due to the presence of a large figure with illuminated characters, which covers most of the center area and changes the focal point of the composition. The pillars that could form the sides of such an archway are obscured by the giant figure, suggesting no visible passageway between two distinct vertical pillars in this edited image.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the two vertical pillars standing symmetrically on either side of the central archway, forming a tall, narrow gateway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of a giant figure with glowing script obscures the structural elements that could form a tall, narrow gateway between pillars. The figure covers the possible area where pillars might stand symmetrically, hence there's no visible clear gateway structure.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the battlements along the top of the structure composed of repeating rectangular merlons and gaps (crenels)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the battlements are visible above the walls. These battlements consist of repeating patterns consistent with rectangular merlons and gaps, typical of crenellation seen in historical architecture often used for fortifications.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a long, low brick wall running parallel to the main structure on the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a longer, low brick wall on the left side of the image parallel to the main large structure where the giant figure is located. This alignment is visually perceivable and consistent with typical structural elements of a fortified area.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a paved pathway extending from the foreground toward the central archway, running between the low wall and the main structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area between the low brick wall and the main structure includes no visible paved pathway leading towards a central archway because the pivotal elements are obscured by the large figure. The pathway is disrupted by the edited features.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there additional arched openings visible to the right of the main central archway, integrated into the same wall structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, additional arched openings are visible on the right side of the figure, indicating continuity in the wall structure with more arches, showing complexity in the architectural design similar to what might be seen in real constructions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the small human figure located on the pathway, positioned behind the viewer and moving toward the central archway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a small glowing human figure, possibly representing a mystic or magical entity, is located on the pathway in front of the giant figure. It appears to be interacting with the large figure, rather than moving towards the archway, revealing a different contextual scene than typical human movement.",
