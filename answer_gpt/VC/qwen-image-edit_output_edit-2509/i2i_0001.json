      "question": "Does the chibi keychain feature a large, singular pearl earring on the girl's left ear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the chibi keychain image (Image B), the visual cues show a simplified representation of the earring area, which does not clearly depict a large pearl earring as seen in classic artworks. The chibi style usually simplifies details, and here it appears as a small dot or absence of detailed jewelry. Thus, it does not feature a large, singular pearl earring based on typical chibi representations.",

      "question": "Is the chibi figure wearing a headscarf with distinct blue and yellow sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi keychain in Image B displays a headscarf with distinct blue and yellow sections. The blue portion predominantly covers the head, while the yellow section hangs down beside the head. This color distinction is evident in typical chibi representations, where colors are bold and clearly delineated.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the chibi keychain show the girl dressed in a dark yellow garment with a visible white collar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the chibi keychain's garment appears to be primarily yellow, matching chibi style simplifications of clothing. The collar is depicted as white, contrasting against the garment and creating clarity given the simplified aesthetics. World knowledge of chibi figures and their emphasis on bright, distinguishable colors guides this assessment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the chibi figure depicted with the head turned slightly towards the front, facing the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi keychain shows the figure with its head oriented toward the viewer. Keychain designs often feature characters facing the viewer for clarity, and this representation shows the face in front view, a common chibi stylistic choice to engage viewers directly.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the chibi keychain attached to a small silver keyring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the chibi keychain explicitly attached to a small silver keyring. The keyring is clearly visible and integrated into the keychain's design, confirming that a silver keyring is indeed part of the complete object, matching typical chibi keychain construction.",
