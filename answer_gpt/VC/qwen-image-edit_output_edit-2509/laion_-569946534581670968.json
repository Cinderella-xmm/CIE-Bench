      "question": "Is the golden-brown color present on the plush chicken wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chicken wings appear plush and have a golden-brown color. This is inferred from observing the texture and color tones that are typical of plush objects designed to mimic the appearance of fried chicken, showcasing a resemblance to the golden-brown color of crispy fried chicken. Common knowledge about plush toys and their design often involves mimicking real objects using colors and shapes.",

      "question": "Are the plush chicken wings shaped like real chicken wings, including distinct drumettes and flats?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the plush chicken wings are shaped with distinguishable parts that mimic real chicken wings, such as the drumettes and flats. This conclusion is reached by comparing the shape and size of each plush object to the typical anatomy of chicken wings, which usually feature these distinct segments.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a small white bowl located at the bottom right corner of the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a plate of plush chicken wings without a small white bowl visible at the bottom right corner. Instead, an orange object that appears to be a plush is situated closer to the bottom right of the plate in place of where a bowl might be expected. Based on observation, the conclusion is that the bowl is missing.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the object inside the small white bowl bright orange in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination of Image B, there is no small white bowl visible; instead, a plush orange object is placed on the plate near the bottom right. This suggests a deviation from having an orange sauce-like substance inside a bowl. Therefore, based on visual cues, the presence of a bright orange substance within a bowl is negated.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there approximately ten plush chicken wings on the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Reviewing Image B reveals that there are seven plush chicken wings on the plate as identifiable by counting the visible objects distinctly mimicking chicken wing anatomy. This is contrasted with the question of having approximately ten, leading to the conclusion that the number of wings is less than ten.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no observable small white bowl near the bottom right corner. Instead, an orange plush object occupies the position on the plate. Understanding the layout indicates a discrepancy from a small white bowl being positioned there, resulting in a conclusion based on observed placement and context.",
