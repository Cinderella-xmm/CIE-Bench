    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are both feet positioned en pointe, with the right foot slightly ahead of the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue's feet do not follow the en pointe positioning indicative of ballet, which involves sustained elevation on the tips of the toes. Instead, the statue's feet are flat on the ground and not in the described position. Considering this, the feet aren't placed in an en pointe manner as suggested in the question.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both arms extended laterally from the body, with palms facing inward and fingers gently curved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue's arms are posed with the left arm extended, bent slightly at the elbow with fingers not clearly visible to confirm the gentle curve or inward positioning of palms. The right arm is slightly bent and extended outward but not laterally. No signs of the specific arm and finger positioning described are evident.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the head turned to the left, with the chin slightly raised?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From the orientation and visible profile of the statue's head in Image B, it appears to be turned slightly left, but without evident evidence of the chin being raised due to the angle and positioning which lacks the upward tilt.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the legs fully extended and aligned vertically, with the spine slightly arched backward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The statue's legs in Image B show partial extension with one leg positioned forward and bent slightly at the knee, while the spine shows a natural posture without an arched backward tendency, indicating less vertical alignment.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the arms positioned at approximately hip level, extending outward from the sides of the torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the statue with one arm extended outward from the torso but not at hip level; the arms have varied positions with one higher than the hip and another reaching outwards.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the upper body slightly tilted forward while maintaining vertical alignment through the spine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the posture of the statue indicates a straight and upright stance; the upper body's alignment and verticality do not exhibit a forward tilt.",
