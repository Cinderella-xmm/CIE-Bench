        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoe retains a triangular panel structure across the midfoot, indicating that its shape and spatial arrangement have been preserved. The panels are evident from their arrangement and appearance visually similar to how such structures are typically placed in athletic shoes for support. Comparing with Image A, the arrangement appears consistent, signifying preservation.",
