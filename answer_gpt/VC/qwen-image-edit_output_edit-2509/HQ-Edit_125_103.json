      "question": "Is there a large pink peony flower prominently displayed on the body of the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe a large cylindrical tea container adorned with red and gold motifs. There is no teapot present in the scene, which suggests that any inquiry about a teapot would yield 'No' as the correct answer because a teapot isn't visible.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a white clustered flower located next to the pink peony on the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a cylindrical tea container with golden floral motifs on its red surface. There is no visual evidence of a teapot with a pink peony or clustered white flowers. Since a teapot isn't visible in Image B, the correct response is 'No' for this question.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there green leaves and stems extending from the base of the flowers on the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object displayed is a cylindrical red tea container, not a teapot. The decorative gold patterns don't include green leaves or stems. With no teapot present to display such features, the answer is 'No'.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases red tea containers with gold floral designs lacking any of the specified colors such as pink, white, green, or orange-red berry accents. Since these elements aren't present with respect to a teapot, the answer is 'No'.",
      "weight": 2,

      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is amber-colored tea visible in all four cups?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B only displays red tea containers, with no cups with tea visible. There aren't any cups shown in the second image, so the answer is 'No'.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the floral elements centrally located on the body of the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The second image shows a red tea container, where floral designs are present but not centralized on a teapotâ€”no teapot is visible. Thus, the answer is 'No'.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include a teapot; instead, it features a smooth-surfaced red tea container, which lacks any mesh or woven patterns. Therefore, the response is 'No'.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents red tea containers without any visible cups in the surrounding. Since no cups are displayed in the edited image, 'No' is the correct answer",
