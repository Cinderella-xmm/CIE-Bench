      "question": "Is the orange circular lifebuoy still present and clearly visible in the same position near the netting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, I observe that there is no longer an orange circular lifebuoy visible near where the netting was. A creature appears in the forefront of the image, which occupies the space where the lifebuoy was once present in Image A. This suggests that the lifebuoy has been removed or is obscured in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dark mesh netting still visible along the shoreline, connected by vertical poles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dark mesh netting is no longer visible along the shoreline. In its place is a creature occupying the area where the netting was previously. This indicates that the netting has been removed or is no longer visible in the edited image. Image A contained a visible mesh netting in this position.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the shoreline maintain its original diagonal slope from the bottom left to the top right of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the diagonal composition of the shoreline is altered by the introduction of a large creature that covers part of the shoreline, obscuring the continuity of the slope. Analysis of Image A shows a clear diagonal slope from bottom left to top right. The edited image disrupts this visual line.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the orange lifebuoy physically connected to one of the vertical poles of the netting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orange lifebuoy is not visible at all, let alone being connected to any vertical poles. Image A showed the lifebuoy physically attached to a vertical pole of the netting. The absence of both the lifebuoy and the netting in the edited image confirms that there is no such connection.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible white foam patterns in the water immediately adjacent to the shoreline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that there are still visible white foam patterns in the water adjacent to the shoreline, which are indicative of waves breaking along the shore. Image A also had these foam patterns, and they have been retained in the edited image, despite the creature's presence.",

      "question": "Is the sand along the shoreline still light beige in color, without significant discoloration or tinting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sand along the shoreline maintains its original light beige color, consistent with the appearance in Image A. There is no noticeable discoloration or additional tinting introduced in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vertical poles that supported the netting are not visible at all. The presence of the creature covers the area where the poles and netting appeared in Image A, effectively removing them from the edited scene.",
