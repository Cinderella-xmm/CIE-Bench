      "question": "Is the central positioning and rectangular shape of the light blue sofa retained in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sofa is centrally positioned within the composition, and it maintains its recognizable rectangular shape with cushions similar to those in traditional sofas. Although the texture and colors are altered to reflect a painting style, the basic shape and position are clearly consistent with a central placement. Thus, based on the visual information and world knowledge about typical sofa arrangements, the central positioning and shape are retained.",

      "question": "Is the framed landscape painting above the sofa still present in its original rectangular proportions and central alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the painting is positioned centrally above the sofa, and its rectangular shape remains consistent, although its texture and style are transformed with a Van Gogh-like artistic approach. The central alignment is preserved, as indicated by its direct placement above the sofa and equal spacing on either side. This analysis, combined with knowledge of common wall decoration practices, confirms the retention of the painting's central positioning and proportions.",

      "question": "Are the large green leaves of the plant on the left side of the sofa preserved in terms of shape and location?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a plant with distinct large green leaves situated on the left side of the sofa, akin to how plants naturally complement living room settings. Despite stylistic changes in texture, the overall shape and position relative to the sofa correspond with those typical in home decor. This coherence in visual structuring, even within a painted aesthetic, verifies that the plant’s location and leaf shape are preserved.",

      "question": "Is the blue-based lamp with the white shade positioned on the table to the right of the sofa preserved in terms of shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a lamp on a side table to the right of the sofa, maintaining its blue color with a white lamp shade. The shape and position are consistent with traditional table lamps found in similar settings, providing lighting and decoration. Although the painting style modifies the texture, the visual cues ensure these attributes are retained.",

      "question": "Is the presence of the light-colored rug beneath the sofa retained in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an area beneath the sofa consistent with the placement of a rug. The texture and appearance are altered with vibrant, swirling colors associated with an artistic rendition, yet the presence of an element of similar size and location suggests retention of a rug or floor furnishing typical in residential settings.",
