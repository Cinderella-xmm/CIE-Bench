      "question": "Is the dark brown tree branch on which the bird is perched clearly visible and positioned in the same location as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited bird is perched on a branch that appears consistent with world knowledge of a tree branch, characterized by its thick, sturdy appearance. This tree branch is in a similar position to the original image (Image A), located centrally in the frame and supporting the bird. The primary visual cues, such as its color and thickness, suggest that it remains unchanged in positioning relative to the original image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the pink five-petaled cherry blossoms with visible yellow stamens and red centers still present in the scene, particularly near the bird and along the branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, pink cherry blossoms are indeed present along the branches near the bird, consistent with the visual depiction in Image A. Despite the edit, the characteristic pink five-petaled shape can be recognized, with the blossoms appearing unchanged in their placement, reinforcing continuity across both images.",

      "question": "Is the bird (or its transformed spirit form) positioned on the same branch, in the same central-left location, facing toward the left side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited bird in Image B, which appears in a transformed form, maintains its position on the same branch seen in the original image (Image A). Consistently located towards the central-left part of the frame, it is facing left, aligned with the original bird's orientation, thereby preserving positional accuracy.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently displays green leaves sprouting from the branches, particularly near the bird, similar to the original image. These leaves, characterized by their freshness and visible vein details, provide the same foreground botanical context as seen in Image A.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunlight illuminates the scene from the upper left, producing a warm golden glow. This subtle lighting enhances the bird and blossoms, consistent with the direction and effect of sunlight prevalent in the original image. The lighting condition remains unchanged.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
