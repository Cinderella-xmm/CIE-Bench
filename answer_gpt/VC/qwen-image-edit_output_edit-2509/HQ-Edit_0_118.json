      "question": "Is the woman’s hair short, silver-gray, and styled in a neat bob with soft waves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair appears in the depiction with silver-gray color, styled in a fashion that resembles a neat bob with soft waves. This can be deduced from the typical stylized representation in such illustrations, where the texture and flow of the hair suggest a bob cut. Such hairstyles are often used in imagery to denote elegance and simplicity, likely due to the context of a calm reading scene in nature.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glasses are slightly obscured, but you can faintly detect small, circular shapes above where the eyes would be, implying circular lenses. Thin frames often accompany such designs to maintain subtlety and not distract from other facial features. This conclusion is aided by recognizing common eyewear styles for older adults, where circular shapes are often chosen for a classic and unobtrusive look.",
