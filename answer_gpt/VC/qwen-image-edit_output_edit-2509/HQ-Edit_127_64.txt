    "Question": "Q3: Does the sandy pathway extend directly from the foreground toward the Eiffel Tower, maintaining a straight trajectory without bends or interruptions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pathway runs straight from the foreground toward the Eiffel Tower without any visible bends or interruptions. The analysis relies on linear trajectory observation of the pathway connecting the foreground to the background, verifying its straightness and continuity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the sun located in the upper-left portion of the sky with a clear starburst effect radiating outward?",
    "explanation": "Image B features the sun in the upper-left section of the sky, displaying a pronounced starburst effect characterized by rays radiating outward. The examination involves noting the sun's positioning in the sky and the visual impact created by the starburst rays.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are black lampposts with traditional lanterns evenly spaced along both sides of the pathway?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, black lampposts with traditional lantern designs are positioned evenly on the sides of the pathway. The evaluation includes observing the lampposts' placement relative to each other and the consistency of spacing along the path.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there multiple individuals visible in the park, positioned naturally along the path and grassy areas, interacting with the environment?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts people distributed throughout the park, both along the pathway and on the grass, creating a natural and dynamic scene. The analysis involves identifying human figures, their positions, and their interactions with the surroundings, confirming the presence of multiple individuals engaging with the environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
