      "question": "Is the light blue botanical pattern (leaf and vine motifs) present on the bedding in the LEGO version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO version of the bed, the bedding is covered with LEGO elements. It features a color pattern of cyan and white, similar to a blocky camouflage, but there's no visible botanical pattern like leaves or vines. This suggests the botanical pattern seen in Image A is no longer present, suggesting the transformation into a LEGO style removed it.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bedding and bed frame rendered in white with light blue accents in the LEGO version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bedding and the bed frame are constructed using predominantly white and light blue LEGO bricks. These bricks create a pattern distinct from a solid color, but the overall impression is that of a white base with cyan (a shade of light blue) accents. This matches the description, indicating a design that includes white as a dominant color with a light blue-related color.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there exactly two pillows stacked vertically on the left side of the bed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are three pillows visible on the left side of the bed. These are designed with LEGO bricks, incorporating both white and cyan colors. This stack comprises more than two, meaning the description of two pillows doesn't match this LEGO version.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the blanket folded and positioned on the right half of the bed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blanket is constructed with LEGO bricks, forming a geometric pattern over the entire bed. This implies a style more integrated into the design rather than a blanket folded over half, as evident in the LEGO blocks arrangement, covers more than half the bed surface uniformly.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background a uniform neutral gray with no additional textures or elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a plain and consistent neutral gray, aligning with the description of having no patterns or textures. It's a simple color backdrop without any additional visual elements, providing a neutral context for the LEGO bed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a small, dark brown rectangular object visible in the upper right corner, consistent with its presence in Image A, indicating that this element is unchanged in the edited version.",

      "question": "Is the bed positioned horizontally and centered within the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bed is placed horizontally, extending from left to right within the frame. It appears centered vertically and horizontally within the image boundaries. The LEGO structure, along with the bed's alignment, supports this centered positioning.",
