      "question": "Is the Fender logo visible on the headstock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the headstock is shown with vibrant colors and graphical elements. However, upon close inspection, the visual cue of the Fender logo is necessary to determine its presence. Typical headstock designs include brand logos for identification. Here, the graphical elements and design modifications may obscure any logo presence. After inspection, no visible Fender logo is present.",

      "question": "Are there exactly six strings running from the bridge to the tuning pegs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a guitar neck with strings visible. In guitar construction, six-string guitars conventionally have six strings attached between the bridge and tuning pegs — a standard for most guitars. Analyzing Image B visually, it shows six delineated strings across the fretboard heading towards tuning pegs, aligning with this standard.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a cutaway on the upper right side of the guitar body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The graphic modifications in Image B showcase the body with stylized decoration elements. Typically, a cutaway on a guitar allows easier access to higher frets. Image B appears to lack this design feature on the upper right side and instead features artistic elements, deviating from the typical cutaway design.",

      "question": "Is the soundhole located in the center of the guitar body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Soundholes are generally placed in the center of a guitar's body for optimal sound projection. Examining the graphics in Image B, the fundamental design retains the guitar's typical central soundhole positioned in its body, confirming its placement aligned with conventional guitars.",

      "question": "Does the neck extend directly from the body to the headstock without significant deviation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The neck of a guitar commonly extends straight from the body to the headstock for structural integrity and playability. Image B retains this linear extension, consistent with traditional guitar design, without any major deviations or unusual angles interrupting its typical direct path.",

      "question": "Does the guitar body retain the classic dreadnought shape with a rounded lower bout and a cutaway on the upper right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dreadnought shape characteristically features a rounded lower bout and possibly a cutaway for accessing higher frets. Image B shows significant modifications with bold graphical styles altering its perception. With detailed view, the classic dreadnought shape is visually obscured without a cutaway, indicated by the artistic deviations present, indicating a departure from the classic design.",
