      "question": "Is the keychain version of the character still predominantly yellow in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain depicts a character that is predominantly yellow. This is evident from the visible hue of the character's body and head on the keychain. Without needing to compare to Image A, world knowledge about this character suggests that Psyduck, a Pokémon, is usually portrayed in a yellow color. This confirms that the keychain retains the traditional yellow color scheme.",

      "question": "Does the keychain version retain the large, flat duck-like bill?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keychain in Image B shows the character with a prominent, flat, duck-like bill, which is characteristic of the Pokémon Psyduck. This is visible as a light-colored, large feature on the face which is consistent with world knowledge of the character's design. Thus, it retains this feature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the keychain version retain the wide-eyed expression and puzzled look?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain depicts the character with wide, circular eyes and a blank, somewhat puzzled expression. This matches the classical portrayal of Psyduck's confused demeanor, according to general knowledge. Thus, the keychain maintains this distinctive expression.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the small triangular ears still visible on the keychain version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain character doesn’t distinctly display the ears that are present on Psyduck’s original design. The character primarily shows the head and large bill, but details such as the triangular-shaped ears are not distinctly visible. Therefore, the keychain does not prominently feature the ears.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keychain in Image B presents a character with a rounded form, evident in the overall shape of the figure, maintaining the typical roundness associated with Psyduck. This shape is part of the Pokémon’s standard design and is visible here.",
