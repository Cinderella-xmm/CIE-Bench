    "Question": "Q1: Is the 'Schildkröt' brand name visible on the ball box and/or paddle surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, which is a cartoonish illustration, the focus is on the characters which are personified paddles and not on any real product branding.

    "Question": "Q2: Are the paddles clearly depicted with one red rubber surface and one blue rubber surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the paddles are anthropomorphized characters with a red and a blue face, indicating they are colored similarly to standard ping pong paddle rubbers.

}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a diamond-shaped logo present on the handle of each paddle?",

    "Question": "Q4: Are exactly two paddles included in the set?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, two paddles are illustrated as characters, suggesting a pair, although they are not part of a 'set' in the traditional sense of a physical product. Their depiction as animated figures implies a duo, consistent with the idea of two paddles.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is a rope handle visibly attached to the left side of the box?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not depict a physical box with a rope handle, as it is a cartoonish scene depicting an adventure theme with chest-like elements rather than a realistic box representation.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a horizontal partition inside the box that separates and holds the paddles?",

    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the box have a rectangular shape with a hinged lid that opens upward?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a stylized treasure chest which opens with a hinged lid, but its shape is not rectangular in the realistic, commercial sense. The design is whimsical rather than literal.",
