      "question": "Is the white and red color scheme of the train retained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the train features a prominent white and red color scheme, which is evident in the visual appearance of the train. The color scheme is typically used to provide a striking contrast and is common in contemporary train designs to signify speed and modernity. Without referring to Image A, Image B clearly shows this specific color scheme.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the train remain on a suitable track or elevated system, consistent with the maglev design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train is seen on an elevated track system, consistent with the design for high-speed or maglev trains. Such designs are integral for their operation to ensure reduced friction and increased speeds. The image provides a clear view of the train's alignment on tracks, which align with common maglev track designs.",

      "question": "Is the background environment, including the horizon and setting, largely consistent with the original scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a sea and sky in the distance along with some clouds, indicating a coastal setting. The positioning of these features along the train's route suggests that the environment is consistent with a scenic coastal train line. Without comparing to Image A, the presence of these elements gives a coherent background that aligns with train routes often designed through scenic locations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the lighting and shadows consistent with those in the original image, preserving the realistic look of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows realistic lighting with shadows that fall naturally due to the presumed position of the sun, as indicated by the direction of shadows on the track and the train. The lighting seems to be consistent with typical sunny day conditions, reinforcing a realistic depiction of the environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the train maintain realistic proportions and scale in relation to its surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The train in Image B appears to have proportions that align with common expectations for high-speed or maglev trains, with a streamlined body and windows appropriately scaled to fit passenger size. Its size in comparison to the visible background conveys the appropriate scale for such a transport system relative to its environment.",
