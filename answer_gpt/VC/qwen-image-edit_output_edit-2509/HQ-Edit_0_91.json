      "question": "Is the circular golden medallion located at the center of the floral panel on the chest still present and positioned in the same place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral panel on the chest features a circular golden medallion, similar to Image A. The floral pattern in Image B is stylistically similar but not identical; however, the medallion maintains its central position. Given the consistent placement, the answer is based on visual observation and the positioning remains unchanged.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the multicolored floral patterns (including red, blue, yellow, and white flowers) visible on the sleeves and shoulders of the robe, maintaining their original positions and compositions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns on the sleeves and shoulders are stylized in a more simplified and uniform color palette, primarily featuring gold and blue without the original multicolored design seen in Image A. The positions may be similar, but the compositions are notably different due to limited color variety.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair is styled in a simplified illustration showing white hair neatly swept back from the forehead without a clear left-side parting. Image A shows a more detailed hair division and part styling, which isn't clearly reflected in Image B.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
