      "question": "Is the plaid pattern (with red, blue, and black intersecting lines) on the left tie preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left figure is holding a watch in his hand and wearing a tie with a pattern, similar to the plaid tie in Image A, with intersecting lines of red, blue, and black, indicating that the plaid pattern is indeed preserved. The visual information, coupled with the knowledge of common tie patterns, confirms this.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the green and yellow bear-shaped emblem on the right tie preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right figure has been depicted with a large camera head, and there is no detail of a tie or an emblem visible as the cartoon focuses on the camera aspect as his head. The emblem itself is not visible in Image B.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are both ties preserved in their original necktie shape (narrow, tapered, diagonal across the chest)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left tie is visible and maintains a typical necktie shape, consistent with the description in Image A. However, the right figure in Image B has been altered to have a camera head and the focus is on the gadget in hand, so the traditional necktie is not present. One of the ties loses its original form.",

      "question": "Is the figure with the plaid tie on the left side of the image, and the figure with the emblem on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the configuration of the two figures maintains consistency with Image A. The figure holding the watch and with a plaid tie is on the left, while the one with the altered camera head (originally with the emblem) is positioned on the right. This setup is clear from their depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the general background features green grassy areas extending into the distance. Despite Image B being a cartoon, it replicates this environment faithfully, showcasing a similar grassy setting as seen in Image A.",
