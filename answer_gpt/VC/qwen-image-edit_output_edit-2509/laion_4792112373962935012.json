      "question": "Is the cocktail liquid pale yellow in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a glass with liquid that appears to be a light yellow color. This observation is based on the visual cues in the image, which are typical of certain types of cocktails like margaritas. The visual representation shows the liquid is not dark or highly saturated, leading to the conclusion that it is indeed pale yellow.",

      "question": "Does the lime wedge have a bright green outer rind and visible segmented interior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, rather than a typical lime wedge, there is a whole lime with a sombrero and maracas, appearing as an anthropomorphized lime figure. Therefore, since there is no visible slice of lime with a segmented interior, it cannot have the characteristic features described.",

      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rim of the glass in the edited image shows a coating of granules that appear to be a mixture of white and red particles. This is typical of a salt and chili powder mixture often used to rim glasses of certain cocktails.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a glass that clearly contains translucent angular shapes that resemble ice cubes. This is derived from the reflective properties and geometry commonly associated with ice cubes in beverages.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the background is richly colorful with confetti, likely indicating a festive atmosphere. The surface under the glass is also blue, but it is difficult to determine the exact hue due to the presence of numerous visual elements.",
