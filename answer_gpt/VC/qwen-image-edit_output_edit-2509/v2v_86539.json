      "question": "Do the characters retain their potato-like shape and texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are depicted with a smooth, rounded shape, consistent with a potato-like appearance. They have no distinct features that alter this perception, such as limbs or facial features typical of more anthropomorphic forms. The texture is simple and flat, often seen in stylized cartoon depictions, further supporting the potato comparison.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the potato character in the first panel still depicted as exercising with dumbbells and wearing a green headband?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the first panel shows the potato-like character holding what appear to be dumbbells, which implies exercising. Additionally, the character wears a headband, which is typically associated with workouts to keep sweat at bay. These visual clues suggest the activity is consistent with exercising.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the potato character in the second panel remain inside a cardboard box, indicating sleep?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second panel of Image B, the potato character is shown lying down inside a cardboard box, tucked with a blanket, indicating sleep. The use of a box as a bed is a stylized choice, but the presence of a blanket suggests the character is resting or sleeping.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the third panel shows the potato character at a table with food items, suggesting the character is engaging in eating. The presence of a spoon in the character's hand alongside bowls on the table reinforce the activity as dining.",

      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B distinctly represents three separate activities across the panels: the first panel shows exercising with dumbbells, the second panel depicts sleeping in a box, and the third panel illustrates eating at a table with food items. Each panel has clear visual cues that align with these specific activities.",
