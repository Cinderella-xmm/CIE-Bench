      "question": "Does the image retain the stark black-and-white contrast characteristic of the zebra's stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes are still very distinct, maintaining the classical stark black-and-white contrast that is characteristic of zebras. This can be seen from the clear delineation and high contrast between the black and white stripes on the zebra's body, which stand out against the altered background. Zebras are known for their unique black and white patterns, which are generally high in contrast, ensuring they remain prominent. The edited background also enhances this contrast by using black and white stripes.",

      "question": "Is the zebra's mane still upright and striped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's mane remains upright and follows the same pattern as in natural images where each individual hair seems to be standing perpendicular to the neck. The mane's stripes continue to maintain the black-and-white pattern, in keeping with the zebra's overall striped motif, which is normally seen in zebras in the wild. The visual cue of an upright, striped mane is a characteristic feature of zebras.",

      "question": "Are the zebra's ears still pointed and visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the zebra's ears are indeed pointed and distinctly visible. They retain their usual shape, protruding from the sides of the zebra's head, similar to what is commonly seen in these animals. Zebras have pointed ears that are both noticeable and integral to their silhouette, and the image accurately preserves this characteristic.",

      "question": "Is the zebra depicted in a grazing posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is depicted with its head lowered towards the ground in a position that signifies grazing, which is typical behavior for these animals. This posture is aligned with how zebras are often seen in their natural habitat when they eat grass. The body stance and position of the head in Image B reflect this typical grazing behavior.",

      "question": "Is the background still primarily composed of green grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a background that has been drastically altered from what would typically be expected in a zebra habitat. Instead of green grass, the background now consists of an abstract, stylized pattern of black and white stripes that mimic the zebra's own stripes. Such a change deviates from natural environments zebras inhabit, which usually include stretches of grassland.",
