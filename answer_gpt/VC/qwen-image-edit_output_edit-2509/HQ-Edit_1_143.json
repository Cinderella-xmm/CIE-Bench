      "question": "Is the scientist depicted with her right hand holding a pipette or similar instrument, angled toward the test tubes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scientist's posture indicates that her right hand is holding a pipette, as inferred from the angle and position of the hand toward the test tubes. This suggests an action typical of laboratory work involving handling of liquids.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there multiple test tubes arranged in metal racks, containing teal or greenish-blue liquid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows multiple test tubes neatly organized in metal racks, and the color of the liquid inside them appears to be teal or greenish-blue. This setup is consistent with a laboratory environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a microscope visible on the right side of the workbench, with an eyepiece and stage clearly defined?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, on the right side of the workbench, there is a piece of laboratory equipment that resembles a high-tech analysis tool with digital screens. However, there does not appear to be a traditional microscope with an eyepiece and stage as typically defined.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features two digital screens displaying patterns that are circular and intricate, characteristic of molecular or crystalline structures. The blue-green tone enhances the scientific context of the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The attire of the scientist in Image B includes a white lab coat and glasses with a round frame. These details align with a stereotypical depiction of a scientist actively engaged in a laboratory setting.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The liquids in the test tubes in Image B are indeed a shade of teal or greenish-blue. This color choice complements the overall scientific and futuristic theme of the image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the scientist positioned in front of the test tubes, with the microscope to her right and digital screens behind her?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scientist is indeed positioned in front of the test tubes. However, while the digital screens are behind her, what could be interpreted as a microscope in a broader context is more of a digital instrument setup to her right, aligning generally with the description.",
