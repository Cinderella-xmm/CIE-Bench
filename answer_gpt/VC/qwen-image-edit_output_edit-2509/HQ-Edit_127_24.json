    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there exactly two chalet-style buildings visible in the scene, positioned side-by-side on a snowy slope?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the castle is depicted with several spires and features an icy design, unlike traditional chalets, which are typically wooden alpine houses. Therefore, there are no chalet-style buildings visible side-by-side.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there visible smoke rising from at least one chimney on a building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a large castle made of ice, with clear blue colors and no visible chimney structures similar to those found on chalets. Therefore, there is no smoke rising from chimneys.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there multiple windows across both buildings that emit a warm yellow-orange glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The windows in Image B are part of the icy castle and do not emit any warm glow; instead, they blend with the icy-blue color of the structure. There is no indication of warm yellow-orange glows.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there tall, conical evergreen trees with snow-covered branches visible behind and around the chalets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features tall trees with snow-covered branches, similar to evergreen trees found in wintry landscapes, around the icy castle. However, there are no chalets, only a castle. The image does feature tall, snowy trees.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a large, snow-capped mountain peak visible in the background, rising above the treeline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the background includes snowy mountains, they are not prominently rising above the treeline in the same way as depicted in mountainous chalet scenes. The focus is on the castle with an aurora in the sky.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there smooth, rounded snowdrifts in the foreground, casting soft shadows toward the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts icy terrain rather than smooth, rounded snowdrifts usually cast with soft shadows. The foreground consists of an ice-like pathway leading to the castle, without distinct shadows similar to those from snowdrifts.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a bright, circular light source (moon) visible in the upper-right portion of the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no circular moon visible in the sky; instead, the scene features the aurora borealis lighting up the sky which is greenish and wavy, and not circular like a moon.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
