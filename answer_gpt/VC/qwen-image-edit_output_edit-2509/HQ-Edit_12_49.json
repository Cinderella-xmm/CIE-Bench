      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the baroque-style scrollwork and acanthus leaf motifs present and accurately reproduced in the same positions and forms as in the original clock frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging features ornate detailing that echoes the lavish aesthetic present in image A's clock frame. The box's exterior incorporates scrollwork and motifs similar to those in baroque art, defined by elaborate decorations and foliage designs such as acanthus leaves. However, there are variations due to the functional differences between a clock frame and a box, their positioning, and form don't replicate the clock's exact design, accommodating the watch's display and allowing for a different arrangement that fits the box structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the symmetrical arrangement of the top and bottom finials and side scrollwork preserved exactly as in the original clock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the arrangement of decorative elements on the box does display symmetric attributes typical of luxurious packaging, similar to the symmetrical elements on clock frames like in Image A. However, due to the nature of a box and a clock frame, the exact symmetrical arrangement of finials and scrollwork isn't replicated, with adjustments made to fit the packaging structure and design intent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the rich mahogany tone and visible wood grain texture of the frame preserved in the packaging design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a watch packaging with a pronounced reddish-brown hue, often associated with mahogany. The detailing includes crafted edges pointing to a finished wooden appearance, likely intended to mimic fine craftsmanship. However, the actual media of the box contrasts with the clock's crafted wood frame due to differing material features such as the grain texture seen in natural wood.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the distressed gold finish of the clock face preserved in the watch face within the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals that the watch's face shares a gold-tone similar to the clock face seen in Image A when considered in terms of color. However, the nuanced distressed effect seen on the clock face in Image A isn't directly mirrored in Image B, likely due to the polished nature of watch designs demanding a clean finish that doesn't embody a weathered appearance.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the black Roman numerals (I–XII) present in the same positions and style as in the original clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's watch face includes Roman numerals I–XII that mirror a typical clock's numbering stylistically, suggesting an intent to reflect the aesthetic in Image A where Roman numerals are similarly positioned. Due to the standardization in such numbering, the positions remain consistent across the clock and watch face.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the inscriptions \"2010\" and \"2012\" present in the same positions on the clock/watch face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, the watch face does feature inscriptions akin to a clock face, but the specific numbers '2010' and '2012' that appear on Image A's clock face aren't in the same spots, indicating the packaging draws from the clock aesthetically but replaces specific numbered details necessary for the watch's identity or design narrative.",
