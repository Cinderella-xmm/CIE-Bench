        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture depicts a pug with detailed forehead wrinkles.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the pug with ears that are positioned symmetrically, resembling the folded and floppy ears typical of the breed. While they match the general shape seen in Image A, the sculpture lacks color differentiation because of the material used.",
