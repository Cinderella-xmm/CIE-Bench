      "question": "Does the owl retain its brown and white spotted feather pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl appears to be represented as a LEGO figure. The LEGO design shows a simplified form where intricate details like a brown and white spotted feather pattern are less visible and are instead replaced by a solid brown color to create a 'blocky' look typical of LEGO figures. Therefore, the distinct spotted pattern is absent.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl is depicted as a LEGO figure. LEGO figures usually have minimal facial features. Here, the face region is blurred, making any features like large yellow eyes and a black beak indiscernible. Hence, it's not possible to confirm their presence.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO figure of the owl clearly includes a graduation cap on its head. The design is similar to a typical graduation cap with its flat top and tassel, indicating it is part of the owl's attire in this representation.",
