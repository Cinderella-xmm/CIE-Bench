    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the background a uniform beige color without any gradient, pattern, or texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to be a beige color, but due to the presence of the mechanical beetle and circuit board, there are slight variations in lighting and shading. The transitions in shading around the objects suggest some variation, not a completely uniform background.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the background have no visible texture, grain, or surface variation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B looks smooth and lacks any apparent texture, grain, or visible surface variations. It serves as a plain backdrop for the detailed central subject of the mechanical beetle and the circuit board.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there no shadows, reflections, or light variations on the background surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are shadows and possible reflections from the beetle and circuit board. These cause variations in light across the surface, indicating that the light is not perfectly even. The presence of such elements shows that shadows and light variations exist on the background.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the image framed with straight edges and no border or crop distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image in Image B appears neatly framed with straight edges. There is no visible border or distortion that could suggest cropping or warping. The positioning of the circuit board and beetle within the frame supports this observation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighting on the background evenly distributed with no hotspots or directional shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B shows areas of differing illumination, primarily due to the three-dimensional nature of the central subject casting shadows. These shadows create zones of contrast, indicating that the lighting isn't uniformly distributed across the background.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
