    "Question": "Q1: Are the original seam lines (including those around the front pocket and vertical panel divisions) preserved as embossed linear patterns on the transformed glass vessel?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a glass bottle transformed with elements resembling a wheeled suitcase with intact seam lines. The seam lines are typically visible in fabric luggage but may not be mirrored in glass due to the difference in material texture. Upon inspection, the glass bottle does not show preserved seam lines or patterns similar to those in the original luggage, suggesting that these have not been embossed on the glass surface.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the brand logo positioned near the top center of the front face of the transformed object?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass vessel features a logo situated near the frontal top area of the bottle. This is akin to a branding strategy common for luxury items where placement is strategic for visibility. Analyzing the positioning shows it is approximately in an equivalent location to where logos appear for branding purposes on luggage. Thus, the logo is placed near the top center of the object's front face.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the metallic spray nozzle located at the top center of the object, aligned vertically with the original handle’s position?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a glass perfume bottle design resembling a luggage piece, with its spray nozzle situated centrally at the top. Comparing this positioning with Image A, the suitcase design shows the handle at the top center. Maintaining the vertical alignment between the nozzle on the glass bottle and handle position on the suitcase confirms that this feature remains consistent with the original design logic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are four decorative caps present at the base corners of the transformed object, corresponding to the original wheel positions?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the designed perfume bottle mimics a suitcase by incorporating wheeled elements at its base corners. These resemble decorative caps in this context. In Image A, the suitcase has wheels at its corners, which is typical for rolly luggage. Thus, the placement of wheels/caps corresponds accurately to the original positions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the two zipper tracks of the front pocket preserved as linear features on the transformed object, maintaining their parallel alignment and position within the front panel?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the bottle does not display linear features akin to zipper tracks on its surface. While Image A shows zippers as parallel textured lines, these are absent in the glass transformation. Etching such fine details on glass would not lend practicality nor design coherence for a perfume bottle. Consequently, zipper tracks are not preserved as linear features on the transformed object.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is a handle present on the right side of the transformed object, corresponding to the original side handle’s position?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible side handle present on the right of the glass vessel. Image A, notably displays a handle on the luggage's side, used for carrying purposes. Given glass bottles typically avoid such protrusions due to design sensibilities, the handle is not replicated nor observed in Image B, consistent with its streamlined design of this transformation.",
    "answer": "No"
