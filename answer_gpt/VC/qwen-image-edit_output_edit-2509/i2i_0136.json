      "question": "Does the edited image retain the green stem at the top of the orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object appears to have a green stem at the top, resembling the stem on a real orange. This is visually similar to the stem observed in Image A, which indicates the stem has been retained during the editing process. Therefore, the edited image keeps the green stem visible, indicating its presence at the top.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glossy texture of the orange still present on the keychain model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an object with a glossy texture, evidenced by visible reflections of light on the surface of the orange-like keychain. The same glossy texture is evident in Image A, indicating consistency between the real and edited images. Consequently, the glossy texture is retained in the edited image.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the keychain primarily colored in an orange hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain model predominantly displays an orange color, which matches the primarily orange hue from Image A. The analysis of the edited image suggests that it retains the main orange color scheme, ensuring the keychain matches the color appearance of a real orange.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the surface imperfections and texture patterns of the orange persist on the keychain model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, shows a model with the same visible surface texture patterns and imperfections characteristic of a real orange, as was seen in Image A. The detailed patterns mimic the natural surface of an orange, allowing the texture to remain unchanged in the editing process.",

      "question": "Does the keychain maintain a proportional size and shape relative to the plate it rests on?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the object resting on the plate appears to maintain a similar proportional size and shape. This suggests that despite the addition of keychain elements, the size and shape of the model relative to the plate remain consistent with the original proportions observed in Image A.",
