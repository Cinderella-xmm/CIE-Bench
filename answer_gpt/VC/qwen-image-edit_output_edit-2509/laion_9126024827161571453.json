      "question": "Are the battery tops rendered in copper color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the dominant visual features are a group of characters rather than batteries. These characters exhibit futuristic and robotic designs, implying that the emphasis is not on actual batteries. Thus, the concept of battery tops does not directly apply here, based on the visual cues. Therefore, there is no presentation of copper-colored tops as seen traditionally in batteries.",

      "question": "Is the word \"DURACELL\" printed vertically in white on the black body of each battery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'DURACELL' is not printed vertically on any object resembling batteries because there are no conventional batteries depicted. Instead, the image features robotic characters that do not have any white 'DURACELL' text on a black surface.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a silver band near the base of each battery with the word \"DURALOCK\" inscribed on it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features robotic characters and lacks any depiction of batteries themselves, which means there are no silver bands or inscriptions of 'DURALOCK' visible. The design elements focused instead on the aesthetic representation of futuristic guardians.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the phrase '10 Years in Storage' is indeed visibly present, displayed prominently within a signboard-like element. This aligns with common advertising and graphic design strategies to highlight important product features and guarantees.",

      "question": "Are there exactly four batteries or battery-inspired characters depicted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, five robotic figures are visible and they are designed with traits that can be likened to power-related or battery-inspired aesthetic, being potentially reminiscent of the branding theme associated with Duracell. Thus, four battery-inspired characters are not depicted, as five characters appear instead.",
      "weight": 2,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brand name 'DURACELL' is prominently displayed in large, bold letters at the top of Image B, fitting with typical branding practices to ensure the brand is immediately recognizable to viewers and to establish a connection with the guardians as symbolic representations of product features.",
