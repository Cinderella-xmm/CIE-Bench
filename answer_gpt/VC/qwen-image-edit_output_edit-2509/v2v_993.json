      "question": "Does the chibi character maintain the exact martial arts pose, including the forward leg stance and outward-facing palms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character is seated within an Instagram frame, which makes it impossible to maintain the exact martial arts pose requiring a wide leg stance and arm positioning. The legs are bent and the arms are raised differently due to the setting. Therefore, the chibi character does not maintain the exact stance seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the chibi character wearing a black outfit identical to the original, including the loose-fitting shirt and pants?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B feature the character in a black outfit. The outfit in Image B visually resembles the original, as both include a black long-sleeve shirt and pants, mirroring the original's simplicity and color scheme. However, it may not replicate the same fit entirely due to the stylistic character depiction.",

      "question": "Does the chibi character have a neat bun hairstyle similar to the original subject?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the character's hair appears styled in a neat bun. The chibi representation in Image B reflects this hairstyle by showcasing a smooth, gathered bun, retaining a core element of the original's appearance.",

      "question": "Does the black outfit on the chibi character fit in a way that logically matches the martial arts pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character is seated, affecting how the outfit fits relative to a martial arts pose. The attire may not logically match the requirements of martial arts because there is no demonstration of a wide stance or the typical martial arts movement influences on clothing fit observed in Image A.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both the original and the chibi character's outfits in Image B are simple, lacking patterns or additional design elements, thereby retaining the clean and minimalist aesthetic observed in Image A.",
