      "question": "Is the baby’s head bald with minimal hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the baby appears to have a bald head with minimal visible hair, which is deduced from the smooth and even appearance of the scalp. This visual cue, combined with knowledge about babies often having little to no hair, leads to the conclusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image has the face blurred, so it is impossible to describe or assess the characteristics of the baby’s eyes in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the baby is positioned upright on the couch with legs appearing bent at the knees, but the feet are not flat; rather, they are extended and not pressed against the couch surface. The visible posture supports this conclusion.",
      "weight": 2,

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The baby in Image B clearly grips black-rimmed round glasses with both hands positioned in front of the chest. This visual evidence supports that the baby is indeed holding the glasses in this manner.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question": "Are the baby’s feet covered with black socks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the baby's feet are visible and covered by black socks, as evidenced by their distinct contrast against the rest of the attire and couch. This straightforward observation leads to the answer.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents even lighting, which creates soft shadows around the baby's body and attire, indicating a natural lighting setup without harsh contrast. This lighting analysis supports the conclusion.",
