        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror's frame appears to be of a metallic color with a warm tone, akin to gold. By observing the reflections and the nature of the surface, which is consistent with the properties of gold in being reflective and metallic, I conclude that the mirror frame is likely still gold. Commonly, a gold frame has a warm hue and metallic shine, aligning with what is seen in the image.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the countertop maintains the veined and smooth appearance typical of marble. The visual texture and color-pattern consistency are indicative of marble.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the window on the right displays a dark scene of a city skyline at night instead of backlit greenery as expected during the day. This change suggests a complete alteration in the view, transitioning from natural to urban. Hence, there is no visibility of greenery.",
