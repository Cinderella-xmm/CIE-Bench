        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image portrays a LEGO figurine with a blocky head structure and featureless face, which is standard for such designs, therefore the facial profile of the woman is not preserved.",

      ],

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a LEGO figurine which typically has a neutral figurine face, devoid of detailed expression or skin tone representation, so these are not preserved.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the LEGO figurine design features a blank face without detailed eyes, so the eye color cannot be discerned or preserved.",
