      "question": "Does the illustration retain the man's original face shape and glasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the blurring of the man's face, visual cues suggest that the illustration features simplified facial attributes, making glasses visible. The face retains a generic shape which aligns with typical illustrations but does not specifically replicate detailed individual facial features or the exact shape in Image A. Hence, the illustration focuses more on stylistic representation rather than precise replication.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration in Image B presents the suit jacket without the detailed checkered pattern visible in Image A. The suit in Image B displays a simplified version consistent with the cartoon style, omitting intricate patterns.",
