      "question": "Is the carrot still bright orange in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot is depicted inside a futuristic chamber, maintaining its bright orange color. Analysis is based on visual cues where the carrot's vivid orange hue is clearly visible against the dark soil and encased environment. This coloring is consistent with what is expected from a healthy carrot and indicates no changes to its color in the edited image.",

      "question": "Does the carrot maintain its conical shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot retains its typical conical shape, as perceived from the portion above the soil level. The general tapering form, which is characteristic of carrots, is visually apparent in the futuristic setting, suggesting the carrot has not altered from this form in the edit.",

      "question": "Are the green leaves still present at the top of the carrot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, green leaves are evident at the top of the carrot. This aligns with the natural growth pattern of carrots, where green foliage is expected above ground, consistent with standard agrarian depictions. Given the futuristic context of the image, these leaves appear healthy and unchanged from an expected appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tapered top end of the carrot with visible roots still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the top end of the carrot, which usually features tapering and small roots near the soil surface, looks integrated into a chamber setup and not prominently visible like in traditional soil planting. Thus, in this futuristic container, the visibility of these minute details, such as small roots, may be reduced or obscured by design.",

      "question": "Is the carrot still positioned upright in the substrate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, within the futuristic chamber, the carrot remains upright, growing straight from the soil, which mirrors its natural growth direction. This vertical orientation is a typical and efficient growth pattern, especially visible when cultivated in controlled conditions designed to mimic traditional soil planting.",
