      "question": "Is there a female figure wearing a full-length kimono with a long trailing sleeve and wide hem?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is depicted in traditional Japanese attire, which includes a full-length kimono. The garment has a pronounced trailing sleeve and a wide hem, typical of traditional kimono designs. This is consistent with the common visual depictions of kimonos, which often emphasize their long, flowing nature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the figure positioned with her body angled to the right and her head turned back toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is facing mostly to the right side, in line with the visual elements such as the shoulders and direction of the kimono. The position of the head, however, is not clearly turned back toward the viewer but rather seems to follow the body’s orientation. Typically, if a figure's body is angled, the head would be turned partially or fully to meet the viewer’s gaze if the prompt describes it as looking back.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a straight stone-paved path bordered by evenly spaced cylindrical wooden posts on both sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a grey stone pathway that moves forward through the picture, bordered on both sides by evenly spaced, short cylindrical wooden posts. This type of path design is common in traditional Japanese art and landscapes, often used to denote organized paths in natural scenery.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there cherry blossom trees forming an arching canopy overhead with dense pink blooms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees adjacent to the pathway have branches with clusters of cherry blossoms. However, the branches are arranged more horizontally and do not form a complete arching canopy overhead, as seen in traditional depictions of cherry blossom arches where the branches reach over and touch the opposite side.",
      "weight": 3,

      "is_correct": false

      "question": "Are there fallen cherry blossom petals scattered along the edges of the path and surrounding grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible fallen cherry blossom petals scattered along the edges of the path or on the surrounding grass. The visual does not show any depiction of petals outside the blossoms on the trees.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the path extend straight ahead into a softly glowing, misty distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone path extends straight into the background and seems to fade into a softly glowing area, suggestive of mist or atmospheric perspective, which gives a sense of depth and continuation into the distance. This is a common technique used in art to depict vastness or a serene continuation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure has a floral hair ornament, which includes pink flower-like shapes suggestive of cherry blossoms, as well as golden details, which align with traditional Japanese hair accessories used for formal occasions or artistic depictions of figures in kimonos.",
