      "question": "Is the intricate geometric and floral pattern (including star and flower shapes) present on the exterior of the lantern/packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging features a detailed geometric and floral pattern which includes shapes like stars and flowers embossed on its surface. This observation is evident from the repeated detailed motif visible on the packaging's exterior. Such patterns are typical of intricate design work found in metalwork and traditional craftsmanship associated with cultural artifacts. Comparing with Image A, these types of patterns are visible on the lantern surface as well. Therefore, both share similar intricate geometric designs.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colored glass sections (blue, green, orange, red, yellow) arranged in star and floral patterns visible on the lantern’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, the packaging, does not feature any colored glass sections as observed in the image. It consists mainly of embossed patterns without any translucent or colored components. Image A, the lantern, clearly has colored glass sections arranged in star and floral designs that contribute to its aesthetic. Therefore, these features are not present on the packaging.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the packaging retain the lantern’s characteristic silhouette with a domed top, rounded body, and flared base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging has a rectangular shape, lacking any aspect of the round, domed silhouette seen in Image A, which describes the lantern. The characteristic silhouette of the lantern includes a domed top and rounded body, but the packaging is clearly boxy and angular, which indicates the absence of these features.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are circular patterns resembling spice bowls with colored contents (green, red, yellow, brown) visible on the sides of the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging does not display any circular patterns that resemble spice bowls with colored contents. Instead, it features geometric and logo designs. Image A shows various spice bowls under the lantern. Since the packaging lacks such features or imagery, the answer is no.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are geometric patterns derived from Moorish architecture (e.g., interlacing lines, pointed arches) visible in the texture design of the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases geometric patterns that appear to be inspired by Moorish architecture, such as the interlacing lines and pointed designs, embossed onto the surface of the packaging. This is visually similar to the detailed architectural patterns seen in traditional Moorish design. Thus, these patterns are indeed present on the packaging.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a visual indication of warm light emanating from within or through the packaging, mimicking the lantern’s glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging has a distinct glow emanating from the flame-shaped design at its center, giving the appearance of warm light coming through as it would from a lantern. This is suggestive of an internal illumination source similar to a lantern-like glow, despite the packaging being opaque. In comparison to Image A, this mimics the glowing characteristic of a lit lantern.",
