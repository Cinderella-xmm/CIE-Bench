    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the vertical white \"Under Armour\" logo clearly visible on the outer side of the calf, maintaining its original font, spacing, and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a vertical white text on the side of the sock that resembles the Under Armour logo, maintaining a clear and consistent font, spacing, and orientation on the outer calf. This is similar to common branding placement on sports socks, where such logos are prominently displayed.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there an orange tag with a black Under Armour logo located at the top edge of the sock cuff?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, an orange tag is visible at the top edge of the sock cuff. This tag includes a black logo that resembles the Under Armour logo. This logical placement of brand logos on clothing items suggests it's intended to display the brand prominently.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the stylized \"UA\" logo present on the ankle section of the sock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no distinct 'UA' logo is visually discernible on the ankle section. Logos usually stand out with distinct design features, and since no stylized 'UA' is clearly visible, it suggests that this element is not present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the gray and white geometric patterns on the foot and shin area preserved in their original positions and color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gray and white geometric patterns appear consistent and maintain their positions on the foot and shin area. This suggests that the continuity in color scheme and design has been preserved, which is typical in product designs that do not undergo significant edits.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gray sections at the heel and toe are visibly intact, retaining the shape and location consistent with such reinforced sections found in socks. These sections are often implemented for durability and appear unchanged.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no small text printed vertically along the lower leg of the sock is visible. Text of this nature would typically appear along a designated strip and is likely missing or obscured due to edits.",
