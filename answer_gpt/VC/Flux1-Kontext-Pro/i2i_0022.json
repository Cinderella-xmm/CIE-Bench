      "question": "Is the cat depicted in a curled-up position with one paw visibly stretched out?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is shown in a curled-up position with its body arranged such that the paws are tucked in towards the body. There is no clear distinction of a paw being visibly stretched out. This positioning is common for cats that are resting or sleeping to conserve warmth and feel secure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the cat shown lying on a curved surface representing the car's hood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a sticker showcasing the cat, which is depicted without any background details such as a car's hood or any surface. The image isolates the cat from its original context, focusing solely on the cat itself. There's no visual indication of a car's curved surface under the cat.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there reflection lines present on the curved surface under the cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, since the background has been removed to create a sticker, there are no surfaces like a car hood present, hence no reflection lines can be seen. This edited image focuses entirely on the cat without any external surface details.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the entire sticker image surrounded by a thick white outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the cat as a sticker, and it is indeed surrounded by a thick white outline. This is a common style for stickers to help them stand out against various surfaces when applied.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the sticker have a transparent background behind the outlined image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat sticker is surrounded by a white outline, and the rest of the background is a uniform gray, which suggests that the display method does not indicate transparency. However, stickers often are designed with backgrounds that appear gray but are intended to be transparent when used.",
