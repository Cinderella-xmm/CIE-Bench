    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the balance beam made of wood with visible wear and chipped paint?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the balance beam is not visually present as the gymnast appears to be suspended against a blue background with stars and swirls. As there is no evidence of a balance beam, we can determine that a wooden beam with visible wear is not depicted.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the gymnast maintain a handstand with her body arched backward and legs lifted vertically above her head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gymnast is depicted in an acrobatic position where her body is bent and her legs are resting on a surface, not lifted vertically above her head in a handstand position. Her legs are not positioned vertically but are bent, which disqualifies it as a handstand.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the leotard divided into silver upper body and blue lower body with a gradient transition and sparkles along the spine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leotard is divided between a silver upper body and a blue lower body. A gradient transition is visually present from silver to blue, alongside sparkles along the spine, matching the description.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the gymnast’s hair styled in a tight bun secured with a blue hair tie?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gymnast's hair is styled in a bun, and there is a hint that it might be secured with a hair tie, fitting with the typical look in gymnastics. Although the color of the hair tie isn't distinctly visible, it's plausible it could be blue given the overall theme.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible chalk marks on the balance beam beneath the gymnast’s hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include a visible balance beam, as the gymnast is shown in a position against a backdrop with stars and arcs. There are no chalk marks depicted beneath the gymnast’s hands.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a small stud earring visible on the gymnast’s left ear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gymnast's left ear is visible, but there is no indication of a small stud earring present. The area around the ear appears plain without any standout features, suggesting no earring.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the gymnast’s face turned sideways with her eyes looking downward toward the beam?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gymnast’s face position is obscured, but her orientation suggests a twist that might imply a downward glance. However, without clear visual cues of her face turning sideways, it remains uncertain.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are the gymnast’s hands placed flat on top of the beam, supporting her body in a handstand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gymnast’s hands are not depicted in contact with a balance beam. Since she is not performing a handstand on a beam, her hands are not placed flat on one as described.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Are white gymnastic grips visible on the gymnast’s hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible gymnastic grips on the gymnast's hands. This suggests that her hands are bare rather than equipped with grips commonly used in gymnastics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q10",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature any background elements such as a blurred audience or stadium lights. The background consists of an artistic blue backdrop with stars and swirling patterns, removing any depiction of an audience or lights.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
