    "Question": "Q1: Is the American flag patch present on the right shoulder of the astronaut?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut's suit is depicted in a stylized, cartoon-like manner with certain details visible. The flag patch is situated on the right area of the astronaut's suit, signifying an American nationality. This portrayal aligns with the conventional placement of national insignias on spacesuits. Therefore, the presence of the flag patch on the astronaut's right shoulder in Image B is confirmed.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the blue NASA insignia patch visible on the left shoulder of the astronaut?",
    "explanation": "Image B focuses on the dynamics of the astronaut and does not depict any NASA insignia on the left shoulder. The simplistic, minimalistic style used prioritizes movement and dynamics over detailed representation of specific patches like the NASA insignia. As such, the insignia is not illustrated.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Is Earth visible in the reflection within the astronaut’s helmet visor, appearing above the lunar horizon?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the reflection on the astronaut's helmet visor is stylized to maintain focus on the narrative theme, and specific celestial bodies like Earth are not portrayed. The artist intends to highlight the steps in astronaut dynamics rather than replicate realistic environmental details like the reflection of Earth in the visor.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the International Space Station visible in the background with its solar panels and modular structure?",
    "explanation": "Image B is an infographic showing the astronaut's dynamics within space, not the full context of the external environment. Consequently, elaborate backgrounds such as the International Space Station with distinctive features like solar panels and modular structures aren't depicted. The emphasis is not on the background structures but on the instructional content about astronaut activities.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the ground beneath the astronaut visibly cratered and gray, consistent with the Moon’s surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scene doesn't exhibit a realistic or detailed lunar surface, as it is more focused on illustrating the processes of astronaut dynamics in a space station context. The ground detail, such as a cratered, gray surface synonymous with the Moon, is not rendered in this instructive illustration.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the astronaut facing forward with both side lights on the helmet illuminated?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases an astronaut in multiple angles as they progress through various dynamics. While some of the illustrations of the astronaut indicate a forward-facing orientation, and the lights on the helmet are indicated by small visual elements representing light, the specifics of light illumination aren't a focus in the stylized depiction provided.",
    "answer": "Yes"
