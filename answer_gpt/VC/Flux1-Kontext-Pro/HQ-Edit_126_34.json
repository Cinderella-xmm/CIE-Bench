      "question": "Is the cabinâ€™s roof clearly shaped as an A-frame with snow covering its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cabin's roof is depicted as a distinctive A-frame, characterized by its steep and triangular profile. The surface of the roof is shown to be covered with snow, as evidenced by the texture and color of the artwork, which uses cool tones to simulate a snowy surface. This architectural style is common in cabins situated in snowy environments to prevent snow accumulation and enhance durability.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a chimney located at the peak of the roof, from which smoke is rising?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a chimney positioned at the peak of the roof, protruding upwards, which is a typical design in A-frame cabins to maximize efficiency in heating and smoke dispersal. There is visible smoke rising from the chimney, rendered as swirling patterns that suggest movement upwards into the sky. This use of visual cues aligns with the expectation of a chimney's function.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there exactly three illuminated windows on the upper level and three on the lower level, including one central window on the ground floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cabin displays three windows on the upper level, with warm lighting emanating from them. However, on the lower level, while there are also windows with light, upon closer inspection, there appear to be only two illuminated windows instead of three, including a central one. The distribution and count do not match the specified arrangement.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the walls of the cabin constructed from visible horizontal logs with chinking between them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B suggests the structure of the cabin with horizontal lines representing the layout of logs, typical of log cabins. However, due to the artistic style simulating a painted or drawn texture, the chinking (the material filling the gaps between logs) is not distinctly visible. The artistic approach gives a general impression of log construction without explicit detailing of chinking.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there tall, snow-covered evergreen fir trees surrounding the cabin on all sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cabin in Image B is enveloped by tall trees reaching up into the painted sky, laden with snow, suggesting a dense forest setting. This visual building blocks align with the characteristics of evergreen fir trees, which retain snow on their branches in winter conditions. Such trees commonly frame forest cabins, enhancing the scene's depth and natural setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there smoke visibly rising vertically from the chimney into the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows smoke spiraling up from the chimney, reflecting traditional smoke movement as it disperses into the atmosphere. Despite the artistic swirl and overlap typical to painted impressions, the overall trajectory of the smoke remains vertically oriented, indicating typical chimney smoke behavior.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the scene presented by Image B, there are distinguishable features resembling string lights affixed along the roof's edge beneath the eaves. These elements are depicted with a glowing color, mimicking the appearance of decorative lighting often used for aesthetic or festive purposes typically found in holiday settings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The foreground of Image B includes small, shaped forms at the cabin's base, indicative of shrubbery. These are layered with snow, in keeping with the winter landscape, similar to how snow settles on short vegetation like shrubs, positioned symmetrically around a porch.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a structure resembling a split-rail fence appears in the painting's foreground extending laterally, light in color and partially obscured as if blanketed with snow. This aspect is consistent with rural or rustic settings where such fences are traditionally used and are visible amidst snowy surroundings.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B captures an impressionistic portrayal of snowfall, evident from the swirling patterns in the sky and the texture hinting at falling snow. This artistic depiction intimates gentle snowfall surrounding the cabin, adding a dynamic element and the common winter ambiance fitting the scene.",
