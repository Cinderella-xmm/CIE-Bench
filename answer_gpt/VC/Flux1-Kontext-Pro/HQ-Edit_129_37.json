    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the cardinal direction labels N, E, S, and W clearly visible and correctly positioned on the embossed compass face of the perfume bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the compass face on the perfume bottle features visible cardinal direction labels. Based on visual cues and world knowledge of compass design, these labels are positioned at their typical locations, namely N at the top, E on the right, S at the bottom, and W on the left. This arrangement is standard and aligns with common sense understanding of direction markers on a compass.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the full 360-degree scale with numerical markings (e.g., 0, 90, 180, 270) present and evenly spaced around the outer edge of the embossed compass face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the compass face appears to have numerical markings suggesting degree increments. The even spacing is typical for a 360-degree scale on compasses, marking key angles such as 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees. These visual cues, aligned with the understanding of a standard navigational compass, suggest the presence of a full scale.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the embossed compass face retain the original eight-pointed star-like radial pattern with symmetrical arms extending from the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The embossed compass face on the perfume bottle in Image B displays an eight-pointed star-like pattern. Each arm extends symmetrically from the center, consistent with the typical design of compass roses, which often feature these radial patterns to help indicate directions. This aligns with visual expectations based on compass designs.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the body of the perfume bottle perfectly circular in shape, matching the original compass’s outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle's body is circular, mirroring the outline of a traditional compass. This circular shape is typically seen in compasses to allow for a symmetrical and balanced design. The consistent roundness indicates an attempt to maintain the original compass’s circular form.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the cap of the perfume bottle feature engraved cartographic details such as a compass rose and intersecting grid lines, matching those seen on the map fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cap of the perfume bottle in Image B does not show cartographic details such as a compass rose or intersecting grid lines that match the map fragments observed in Image A. Instead, the cap has a simpler, less detailed design. This indicates that such engravings are absent.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a small central raised dot or hub at the exact center of the embossed compass face, corresponding to the original needle pivot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the compass face on the perfume bottle does include a small central element that resembles a raised dot or hub, consistent with the pivot point typically seen on a compass. This element allows for the needle to rotate, and its presence is congruent with the design of navigational compasses.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the outer ring of the embossed compass face clearly delineated with fine engravings and consistent spacing between degree marks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The outer ring on the compass face of the perfume bottle in Image B is marked with fine engravings and appears to have consistent spacing between degree marks. This degree of craftsmanship is expected in a detailed compass design, signifying accurate and precise markings that are necessary for navigation.",
