      "question": "Is the calico pattern of orange, black, and white patches preserved in the same spatial arrangement across the catâ€™s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat displays a calico pattern with orange, black, and white patches. These patches appear distinct, but they are presented in a geometric and crystal-like texture, unlike the natural fur pattern seen in Image A. While the colors are present, the spatial arrangement differs due to the unique faceted texture, thus slightly altering the natural flow of how these colors appear on the cat's body. Additionally, the black patch covers a larger area on the cat's face in Image B than in Image A.",

      "question": "Are the eyes still green and positioned symmetrically in the center of the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's eyes are vivid green and symmetrically positioned at the center of the face, maintaining a balanced appearance. This symmetry is consistent with typical anatomical features of a cat, promoting facial balance by aligning the eyes symmetrically. Image A also depicted green eyes positioned symmetrically, so there is continuity in this feature across both images.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cat in an upright seated position with both front paws placed directly in front of the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is in an upright seated position, and its front paws are placed directly in front of the body, which is a typical sitting posture for cats. This position ensures stability and comfort when a cat is seated. Image A similarly shows the cat in the same position, so this feature is preserved in the edit.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the pink nose present at the center of the face, surrounded by white fur on the muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's nose is pink and centrally positioned, surrounded by a white area typical of many cat muzzles. This is consistent with the features of Image A, where the pink nose is similarly surrounded by white fur, giving the cat a balanced and cute facial appearance.",

      "question": "Is the cat seated on a vertical wooden block that supports its full weight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat appears to be seated on a wooden block. The texture of the block is rough and resembles wood patterns, providing stability under the cat. Image A also shows the cat on a wooden block, ensuring the cat's seated posture is supported in both images.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the tail curled to the right side and displaying alternating orange and black bands consistent with the body pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's tail appears to be wrapped around its body with alternating patches of color. However, due to the edited crystal-like textures, the consistency and form of these bands do not have the typical fur shading. While the tail is to the side, the alternating bands differ slightly in texture and clarity from Image A, which has a more defined orange and black band pattern.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ears are positioned upright on the head and pointed forward. This positioning is symmetrical, providing balance to the face, characteristic of the feline anatomy. In comparison, Image A also shows the cat with similarly positioned ears, maintaining consistency between the images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chest area is depicted with a white section extending from neck to paws. However, due to the crystal texture, the fluffiness typical of fur is diminished, although the area itself is well-defined as in Image A. The extent and positioning of the white area are consistent, albeit with a different texture.",
