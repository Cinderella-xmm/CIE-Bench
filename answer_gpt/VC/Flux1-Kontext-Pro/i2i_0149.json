      "question": "Does the cat retain its tabby pattern on its face and body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat exhibits distinctive striped patterns on its face and body, a characteristic of tabby cats. The stripes on the forehead, cheeks, and body are visible. In Image A, the same patterns are noted, confirming no change in this aspect. The logic involves recognizing the tabby's unique coat patterns, which are a key identifier of this type of cat and are unchanged in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the cat's eyes still vivid green?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cat with striking green eyes, which stand out against its fur and add to the vividness of the cat's appearance. Examining Image A shows that the cat also had green eyes, and they have been preserved in Image B. This conclusion is based on recognizing the eye color and its consistency across both images.",

      "question": "Is the cat's belly and chest area still white?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat has a white belly and chest, providing contrast to the tabby markings on the other parts of its body. Image A shows the same white-colored areas. This is analyzed by spotting the consistent white fur in the midsection and underside in both images.",

      "question": "Is the cat still positioned on the wooden surface in a relaxed lying posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is depicted resting on a wooden surface with a relaxed posture, indicated by its comfortable lie and leisurely extended front leg. In Image A, the same wooden surface and relaxed pose are observed. This conclusion is reached by recognizing the animal's body language indicative of rest and using the wooden surface as a spatial reference in both images.",

      "question": "Are the fur texture and lighting effects on the cat and the wooden surface preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits detailed fur texture and realistic lighting, enhancing the three-dimensionality of the cat and the surface. Image A similarly preserves these effects, indicating consistency. The reasoning involves noticing the play of light and shadow, as well as the intricate fur details, which are essential for a natural depiction in both images.",
