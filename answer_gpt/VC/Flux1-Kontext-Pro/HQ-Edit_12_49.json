    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the baroque-style scrollwork and acanthus leaf motifs present and accurately reproduced in the same positions and forms as in the original clock frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a watch within a box, while Image A features an ornate clock. The scrollwork and acanthus leaf motifs in Image A are intricate and form the frame of the clock. Image B does not have such motifs on the watch or its box, indicating a change in design focus and material use, rather than replicating the ornamental features of the clock.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the symmetrical arrangement of the top and bottom finials and side scrollwork preserved exactly as in the original clock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch does not exhibit any of the finials or scrollwork seen in Image A's clock. The watch is housed in a box lacking such decorative features, indicating that there was no attempt to preserve the clock's symmetrical arrangement in the watch's design or its packaging.",

      "question": "Is the rich mahogany tone and visible wood grain texture of the frame preserved in the packaging design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a watch ensconced in a box with a visible wood grain and tone reminiscent of mahogany, suggesting an effort to maintain a classic wood finish similar to the original clock's frame in Image A. The color and texture in Image B's box demonstrate a continuity of the wood aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch face contains black Roman numerals around its dial, positioned similarly to those on the clock face in Image A. This consistency in numeral style and positioning suggests an intent to mimic the classic design found in the original clock.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B contain images with clock/watch faces having inscriptions '2010' and '2012.' In Image B, these inscriptions remain in the same positions as visible in Image A. This demonstrates fidelity to the original design regarding these textual elements.",
