      "question": "Is the curved side profile of the grand piano preserved, maintaining its characteristic gentle arc and elongated form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grand piano retains the typical silhouette associated with grand pianos, which includes a curved side profile with gentle arcs extending from the keyboard area to the tail of the piano. This profile is characteristic of the elongated form of grand pianos designed to enhance sound projection. Therefore, the piano's structure in Image B reflects its traditional design. ",

      "question": "Are the four tapered legs with decorative casters present and positioned beneath the piano body as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the grand piano displays four legs with a tapered design that supports the piano's body, consistent with common piano construction. Upon close inspection, these legs have decorative elements at their base, resembling casters, often used for aesthetics and functionality in piano design. Therefore, the legs and casters appear as expected in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the piano positioned directly in the center of the corridor, aligned with the vanishing point created by the columns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the corridor setting forms an architectural vanishing point with columns extending along its sides. The grand piano is positioned such that it doesn't align directly with this vanishing point; rather, it appears slightly off-center from the corridor's perspective. Based on this visual analysis, the positioning isn't directly in line with a central axis formed by the corridor.",

      "question": "Is the floor composed of large square tiles arranged in a repeating pattern of alternating dark and light shades?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a floor with large square tiles that possess a consistent coloration, primarily in a light shade typical of polished surfaces like marble. The tiles do not alternate in dark and light shades rather, they maintain consistent coloring, lacking a repeating pattern of various shades.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there tall, evenly spaced white columns extending along both sides of the corridor, forming a symmetrical passage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the support columns lining the passage display a uniform height and are evenly spaced, contributing to a symmetrical architectural structure. While these columns appear light, they aren't distinctly white but include varied tones typical of natural building materials like marbleâ€”a characteristic in grand architectural designs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the grand piano with a polished black finish, characteristic of high-end pianos designed for both acoustic excellence and visual appeal in elegant settings. This polished surface reflects the surrounding light and architectural elements, adhering to the realistic depiction of glossy piano finishes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B creates soft shadows underneath the piano and across the floor, indicating a directional light source from above, likely through the corridor's ceiling. These shadows contribute to a realistic depiction of the environment, coherent with common lighting setups in indoor scenes with overhead illumination.",
