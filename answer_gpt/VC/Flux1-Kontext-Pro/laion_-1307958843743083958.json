      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the cheetahs in a seated position with bent hind legs, tucked tails, and upright front paws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetahs are depicted in a classic seated position with their hind legs bent at the knee, and the tails are tucked to the side, touching the base they sit on. The front paws are positioned upright and appear to support the cheetah's posture. This positioning is common for figurines designed to convey a natural resting state.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the head of each cheetah turned slightly to the side, away from the central divider?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both cheetah figurines have their heads slightly turned towards the viewer, but away from the central divider, suggesting a watchful and attentive posture. This head orientation is typical for decorative animal sculptures, to provide a more dynamic and lifelike stance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does each cheetah rest on a two-tiered base with a black upper section and a bronze-colored stepped lower section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows each cheetah placed on a base consisting of a black upper section. Since the image is under indoor lighting and taken from a perspective that might highlight reflections, the lower section appears as a continuation of the black base, with no clear bronze-colored stepped lower section visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the cheetah figures positioned symmetrically, one on the left and one on the right, equidistant from the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetah figurines are positioned symmetrically around a central glass divider, with one cheetah placed on the left and the other on the right. They are equidistant from the central divider, creating a balanced and mirrored setup commonly used in decorative pieces to enhance visual harmony.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there exactly three vertical panels positioned between the cheetahs, with two narrower ones flanking a wider central one?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a central vertical glass piece between the two cheetahs. This piece appears to be a singular, wide panel rather than a combination of three distinct panels. Furthermore, the smooth and uniform structure of the glass does not suggest the presence of two narrower panels flanking a central one.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the tail of each cheetah curve upward and rest on the base behind the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the case of Image B, the tails of each cheetah figurine curve slightly downward and rest on the base behind the body. This downward and resting tail posture is common for statues such as these to provide stability and a consistent aesthetic appeal.",
