    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the hippo's large size and wrinkled skin texture?",
    "explanation": "Based on Image B, the hippo is depicted with a substantially large size consistent with its real-world characteristics. The skin texture is smooth and stylized rather than wrinkled, indicating a change in artistic style, likely targeting a whimsical or cartoonish representation. Image A depicts a realistically large and wrinkly hippo, typical for this animal. Comparing both images, the hippo's large size is preserved, but the skin texture is altered. Thus, the edited image keeps the size but modifies the texture.",

    "explanation": "In Image B, the rabbit retains a size that is smaller relative to the hippo, consistent with the size of rabbits in the natural world. It also features upright ears, which are characteristic of rabbits. Image A similarly depicts a small rabbit with upright ears, affirming these characteristics.

    "Question": "Q3: Does the edited image keep the hippo and rabbit positioned close together and oriented towards the viewer?",

This aligns them side by side for a cohesive presentation, akin to characters in a game interface. In Image A, though positioned in proximity, perspectives slightly differ, as they face slightly different directions. Image B explicitly ensures both face the viewer, emphasizing their partnership. Therefore, the edited image maintains proximity and orientation correctly for the viewer.",
