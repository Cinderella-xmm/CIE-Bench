    {

      "question": "Is the sink positioned directly below the mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sink is visually aligned with the bottom edge of the mirror. This spatial orientation indicates that the sink is positioned centrally and directly below the mirror, which corresponds to common design layouts for practical and aesthetic balance in bathroom setups.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the image include a mirror with a black frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror is surrounded by a distinct black frame, which is prominently visible and contrasts with the neon lighting around it. The presence of the black frame is clear and consistent with typical design elements for mirrors.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the fixtures and cabinet predominantly black, while the sink remains white?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the cabinet beneath the sink and the faucet fixtures are matte black, distinguished by the ambient lighting effect. Meanwhile, the basin of the sink itself appears lighter and distinct from the fixtures, suggesting it is white, even though the lighting alters its appearance slightly.",

    {

      "question": "Do the mirror, sink, and cabinets maintain their rectangular shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the mirror's rectangular shape is defined by its frame, the sink has a rectangular basin, and the cabinet below follows a rectangular form. These geometrical shapes are consistent with typical bathroom designs, despite the altered lighting in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Is the black faucet positioned beside the black soap dispenser on the sink?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the black faucet is mounted on the wall above and slightly to the right of the sink, while the soap dispenser, also black, is located on the right side of the sink surface. They are not beside each other but rather in different positions relative to the sink layout.",
