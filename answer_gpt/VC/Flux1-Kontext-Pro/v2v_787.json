      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes almond-shaped and positioned symmetrically on the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The evaluation process can only rely on the visual cues available in Image B, and the area of focus, in this case, is not visible due to the blurred-out face. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the shape or symmetry of the eyes.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there small gold hoop earrings present in both ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the individual appears to be wearing small gold hoop earrings, visible only in the left ear due to the angle of the body and the way the hair is styled. However, without an unobstructed view, confirming the presence in both ears based solely on Image B isn't possible.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the right hand placed inside the front pocket of the trousers with fingers visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the right hand placed inside the front pocket of the trousers with the thumb resting outside, which implies the fingers are likely inside the pocket. This is a common position for relaxed poses and is visually clear in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the hair have a natural, wavy curl pattern falling over the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible hairstyle of the individual is a natural, wavy curl, which falls over the shoulders. This is evident from the visual texture and shape of the hair as it frames the shoulders in the image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the head slightly tilted forward toward the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine the head's tilt, one would look for an angle or orientation of the neckline and overall posture. However, Image B doesn't provide enough information at the facial and neck level to clearly assess whether the head is tilted forward.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the blouse as having a V-neckline, as indicated by the collar shape and the visible part of the blouse. Visible buttons running down the center are also apparent, which are significant details in the visual style of the blouse.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the trousers have a high waist with a visible waistband seam and belt loops?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trousers are visibly high-waisted, as indicated by their position on the waist relative to the blouse's tuck. There are also clear visual cues of a waistband seam and belt loops, which are characteristic features of such trousers, confirming the described style.",
