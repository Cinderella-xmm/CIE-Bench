    "Question": "Q1: Is the central carved wooden panel with floral and scrollwork detailing behind the desk present and unaltered?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central wooden panel behind the desk is richly detailed with intricate wood carvings, featuring floral and scrollwork motifs. This ornate design appears to be a significant characteristic of the panel, asserting its prominence and decorative nature in the roomâ€™s design. Using common sense regarding interior decor, this panel is likely to be a consistent design feature in such richly decorated settings. Comparing this with Image A, which shows a similar feature, confirms that the panel in Image B is present and shares the same detailing with some variations in the ornate design but maintains the overall theme, leading to the determination that the central carved wooden panel is indeed present but not entirely unaltered, as the embellishments differ slightly.",

    "explanation": "In Image B, there is one visible large multi-paned window to the left of the desk, which maintains integrity with its intact glass panes.
