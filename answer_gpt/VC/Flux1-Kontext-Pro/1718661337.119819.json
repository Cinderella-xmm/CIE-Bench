      "question": "Is the white powdered wig with tightly curled sides still present on the figure's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts a figure wearing a powdered wig. This style of wig, characterized by tightly curled sides, is typical of historical attire. The presence of the wig in Image B indicates that it is white and exhibits curls, consistent with common powdered wigs. Thus, the wig remains unchanged.",

      "question": "Does the figure wear a tricorne hat with a dark blue base and gold trim around the brim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the figure is wearing a hat that has a different design compared to the typical tricorne hat. The hat in Image B is a steampunk-style top hat, with a brown base and decorative gears, not matching the description of a tricorne hat. Therefore, the description does not match the hat in Image B.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the figure's right hand is holding an object tightly, with the thumb and fingers wrapped around it. This grip suggests the hand is extended forward, indicating a noticeable posture of holding something securely, consistent with the description.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features in Image B are blurred, making it difficult to distinguish specific attributes like a straight nose, deep-set eyes, or a strong jawline. As such, these specific facial characteristics are not visible or consistent due to the blurring.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the figure is indeed presented in a three-quarter view, which implies a body orientation that is slightly angled towards the viewer and facing slightly to the right. This positioning aligns with standard depiction methods for ensuring both visual detail and depth.",
