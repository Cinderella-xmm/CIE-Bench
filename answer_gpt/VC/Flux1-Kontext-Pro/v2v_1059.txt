    "Question": "Q1: Are the zebras' bodies covered in distinct black and white stripes that follow the natural pattern seen in the original image, including variations in thickness and alignment across the torso, legs, and face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras are shown with their bodies covered in black and white stripes, which is a characteristic feature of zebras. These stripes vary in thickness and are aligned across different parts of the body, including the torso, legs, and face, mimicking the zebra's natural pattern. Without referring to Image A, we can say this pattern is consistent with what is typical for real zebras based on common knowledge about these animals.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is each zebra depicted with its head lowered toward the ground in a natural grazing pose, with legs positioned to support this stance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras are depicted with their heads lowered towards the ground, which is a typical stance for grazing animals like zebras. Their legs are positioned and spaced appropriately to support this grazing posture, typical in managing their balance while feeding.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is the horizontal wire fence with evenly spaced wooden posts clearly visible across the mid-ground of the image, separating the field from the treeline?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a horizontal wire fence with wooden posts spaced evenly across the mid-ground. This fence serves as a separation between the grassy field where the zebras are grazing and the background treeline, which is a common structure for enclosures within such landscapes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Is the ground covered in green grass with visible patches of bare soil and small green shrubs scattered throughout the field?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ground is predominantly covered in green grass. There are also visible variations in color suggesting patches of bare soil interspersed within the grassy field. Furthermore, small shrubs are scattered throughout the grassy area, adding to the natural appearance of the landscape.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is there a continuous line of green trees and bushes behind the fence, with a clear light blue sky above the horizon?",
    "explanation": "The edited image depicts a continuous line of green trees and shrubs behind the fence, which is typical for a natural setting beyond an enclosed area. Above this treeline, the sky is light blue, a standard depiction of a clear day scene without any obstructions like heavy clouds.",

    "Question": "Q7: Are the zebraâ€™s hooves dark in color and positioned on the ground in a way that supports their grazing posture?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the zebras' hooves appear dark in color, which is consistent with their natural hoof coloration. These hooves are positioned firmly on the ground, providing support for the zebras' lowered heads while grazing and maintaining their stability.",
    "answer": "Yes"
