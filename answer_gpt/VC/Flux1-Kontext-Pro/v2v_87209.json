      "question": "Does the blue owl still have large white eyes and a yellow beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the blue owl is prominently featured, and it retains its large white eyes and yellow beak. This is a distinctive characteristic of the owl, evident through both its color palette and shape. This can be corroborated by observing that these features are pivotal in defining the owl's facial structure, which is clearly visible in the edited image.",

      "question": "Are there still smaller owls present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B predominantly features two owls: the larger, central blue owl and a smaller owl next to it. However, there is no depiction of other small owls apart from these two in Image B. In contrast, Image A has multiple small owls visible at the bottom. This suggests that only one of the smaller owls as seen in the original context remains in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'OWLEGORIES' is prominently displayed at the top of the image, maintaining its presence from the original version. The font style and position within the composition help identify the title of the series, ensuring its continued presence in this image.",

      "question": "Is the owl still holding a book?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The observation of Image B shows the owl without any books visibly in its grasp. Unlike the edited A version where books are visible, this detail is omitted in the stylized presentation of Image B, where the focus is more on the artistic depiction of the owls.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is an artistic rendition of the owls and does not display any interactive elements such as buttons. The absence of a 'SHOP NOW!' button, which was present in Image A as an overlay indicating interaction, demonstrates that Image B is more of an artistic or promotional poster without digital call-to-action elements.",
