      "question": "Is the train represented in a red-and-gray color block scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train is depicted with a red and gray color block pattern. The body of the train features red and gray horizontal stripes, which is consistent with many modern trains where bright, contrasting colors are used for visibility and design. This visual cue suggests a red-and-gray color block scheme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the sign circular with the text \"STOP\" clearly displayed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sign is not circular; it is a rectangular sign containing an octagonal shape that resembles a stop sign. This octagonal shape is common for stop signs globally, and the text 'STOP' is prominently displayed within it.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the train positioned parallel to the tracks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train is drawn in such a way that it aligns with the tracks beneath, suggesting a proper positioning along the railway. This parallel alignment is typical for trains and tracks, as it ensures that the train is on the correct path for movement.",

      "question": "Are there green mountain outlines in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are simplified green shapes behind the train that resemble mountain outlines. The color and shape indicate they are stylized representations of mountains, which are common in landscape depictions where a background setting is desired.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are simplified track lines present beneath the train?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are straight, simplified lines beneath the train that represent train tracks. These lines are more abstract and less detailed compared to real train tracks, indicating a simplified design approach commonly seen in illustrations.",
