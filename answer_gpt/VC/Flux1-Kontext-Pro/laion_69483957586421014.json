      "question": "Is the brand name \"WARING\" displayed in bold white capital letters on a black rectangular plaque with a textured border?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the food processor packaging shows the brand name 'WARING' on the front surface in bold white capital letters, and it's on a glossy package with no visible textured border surrounding the letters. Instead, the texture appears to be behind the letters in a black region on the box image. Hence, the answer is based on the visual appearance and typography style.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feed tube is a tall, vertical cylindrical shape that extends upwards from the lid, but it is located toward the edge, not the center. This placement is typical for wide-mouth food processors, allowing larger items to be added without pre-cutting.",
