      "question": "Is the brand name \"Karls\" clearly visible on the label of the jar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which is an illustration, there are anthropomorphic representations of popcorn and there is no actual brand name 'Karls' visible on any label. There is a jar depicted, but it features smiling popcorn rather than a label with brand text. Therefore, based on visual cues and common sense about animated or illustrative content, the brand name is not visible.",

      "question": "Is the text \"Pumpkin Spice Popcorn\" present on the label of the jar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is an illustrative depiction indicating the theme of 'Pumpkin Spice Popcorn' through creative and thematic elements but does not show a detailed label with text as seen in more realistic images. Thus, in this illustration, such specific text like 'Pumpkin Spice Popcorn' is not present.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the popcorn contained in a clear glass jar with a silver metal lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the illustrative Image B, popcorn is shown in a jar, but the depiction is stylized without realistic details such as a clear glass material or a silver metal lid. The focus is rather on the magical and playful cartoon representation. Hence, it doesn't show a realistic clear glass jar with a metal lid.",
      "weight": 3,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "question": "Is there a white ceramic bowl with a blue rim containing popped popcorn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is an illustration and doesn't include detailed realistic objects like a ceramic bowl with a blue rim. Instead, the image focuses on cartoon characters, such as animated popcorn kernels, therefore there is no depiction of a bowl with these characteristics.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, bursts of corn and a magical illustration are creatively depicted, but specific objects like clear jars containing unpopped kernels are not explicitly shown as it leans heavily into thematic, cartoonish imagery over detailed physical elements.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors of the labels and popcorn orange and brown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration in Image B uses various shades of orange and brown to establish the theme of pumpkin spice, which reflects warmth and autumn. While the style is more illustrative and animated, these colors are dominantly used, aligning with the pumpkin spice palette.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a whimsical illustration and doesn't depict a detailed setting like a wooden surface but rather uses a flat, orange background to suit the theme. The background is more abstract than a physical setting, consistent with the illustration style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are unpopped or popped popcorn kernels scattered on the surface around the jars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is an illustration that stylizes characters and ideas instead of depicting scenes with realistic details like scattered popcorn on an actual surface. It features playful representations of popcorn but does not depict realistic scattering around jars.",
