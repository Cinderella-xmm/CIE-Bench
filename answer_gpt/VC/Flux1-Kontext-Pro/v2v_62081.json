      "question": "Is the portrait of the gentleman contained within an oval shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the shape of the portrait can be evaluated by observing its boundary. In the image, the portrait is integrated into a rectangular background with a drawn rectangular frame. There is no outer oval boundary containing the gentleman's portrait; thus, the portrait is not within an oval shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the gentleman depicted in profile, facing toward the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the gentleman viewed from the side, indicating a profile view. He appears to be facing the left side of the image, as depicted by his hairstyle and the direction of his shoulders. This conclusion can be drawn by observing the alignment and posture of the figure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a cravat tied in a bow at the neck of the gentleman?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible indication of a cravat tied in a bow at the gentleman's neck. Instead, he is wearing a collared shirt and necktie that does not culminate in a bow, which is typical for a cravat.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gentleman has dark hair that is styled neatly. However, there are no visible sideburns extending from the temples to the jawline, nor is there a mustache visible in the illustration. This can be concluded from the absence of such facial hair features in the illustration.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gentleman is depicted wearing a coat that envelopes his shoulders and appears to cover his upper back, indicated by the structured lines and folds typical of a coat's construction. This is visible by the coat collar and shoulder contours in the image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depicted profile view in Image B provides visibility of the outline of the gentleman's nose and jawline quite clearly. His eye is depicted along the profile view's edge, confirming their visibility from the viewer’s right-side perspective.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B displays a rectangular framing device enclosing the main image, the gentleman's portrait itself does not adhere strictly to an oval portrait, nor is the frame itself described or depicted as classically oval. The portrait is separate from being housed in an oval form.",
