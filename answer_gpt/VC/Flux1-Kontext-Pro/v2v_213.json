      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's wings exhibit a pattern with black spots and white markings typical of certain butterfly species. These markings are clearly visible against the orange and brown hues of the wings. This pattern is also a defining characteristic observed in many butterflies, aiding in camouflage and predator deterrence. The presence of these features in Image B indicates that the specific black spots and white markings are retained.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the fuzzy texture of the butterfly's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body of the butterfly in Image B appears smooth and lacks the fuzzy texture often seen in actual butterfly pictures. A fuzzy texture on a butterflyâ€™s body might be identified by the presence of small hair-like structures. In Image B, the butterfly's body appears to be rendered without these textures, giving a clean and artificial finish in contrast to a photorealistic or natural hairy appearance.",

      "question": "Is the butterfly still positioned on the wooden surface in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background context has changed. The butterfly in this image is not positioned on a wooden surface. Instead, it appears to be placed against a plain, uniformly colored backdrop that does not exhibit any wooden texture or grain. This shift to a minimalistic and digital-style background indicates that the positioning on the wooden surface is not retained in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the detailed texture of the butterfly's wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the pattern and coloration are present, the surface texture of the wings lacks the detailed granularity that can be found in natural settings. The wings appear smooth and somewhat uniform, pointing to a more graphic-style rendering rather than a capture of real-life detailed texture that often includes slight imperfections and varied translucency.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image showcases a distinct arrangement of spots and patterns on the wings that resemble those commonly recognized on butterflies. Image B retains a pattern similar to what would be typically found on such an insect, indicating that the specific arrangement of these spots is consistent.",
