      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eagle's head is clearly visible and displays a distinct white color, which is characteristic of a bald eagle. This conclusion is drawn from the visual cue of the eagle's head color combined with the world knowledge that bald eagles have distinctive white heads.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eagle’s beak is prominently shown and is evidently yellow with a hooked tip. This matches the typical appearance of a bald eagle's beak, which is known for its yellow color and curved shape.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tail feathers of the eagle in Image B are white and appear to be fanned out. This matches the common depiction of a bald eagle's tail, where the feathers are typically white and often displayed in a spread manner when in flight.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eagle in Image B has its wings fully extended upward and outward in a manner that resembles a soaring pose. This is a typical posture for eagles when they are gliding or soaring, which is visually evident in the image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eagle's eye is not clearly visible due to the positioning and the angle of the illustration. However, given the close-up view of the eagle, the typical trait of a bald eagle's eye being yellow can be reasonably assumed to be depicted.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings in Image B are depicted with a pattern showing layers of feathers. The tips are darker while the bases of the feathers are lighter, indicating depth and detail that reflect the characteristics of a bald eagle's wings.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall silhouette of the eagle in Image B, with its distinctive white head, yellow beak, fanned tail, and extended wings, matches the iconic shape and features typical of a bald eagle in mid-flight.
