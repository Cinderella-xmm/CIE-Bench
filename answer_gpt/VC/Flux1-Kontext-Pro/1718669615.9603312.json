    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the presence of two parallel railway tracks extending into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), there are clearly two parallel railway tracks that extend from the foreground into the distance. The parallel nature of the tracks is visible as they recede toward the horizon. This indicates that the edited image retains the railway tracks from the original.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the railway track visibly curved to the right as it recedes into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the railway tracks appear to maintain their straightness as they extend into the distance. There is no visible indication of a curve to the right; instead, they seem to have a subtle turn to the left, similar to Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the UFO positioned directly above the central axis of the railway track?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a large ceramic vase instead of a UFO, which is positioned not symmetrically but slightly to the left side of the railway tracks, indicating it's not directly above the central axis.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a clear horizontal line separating the sky from the land in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a well-defined horizontal line separates the sky and the landscape in the background near the horizon. This line demarcates the transition between the land and sky, giving a clear separation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the railway track visibly elevated above the surrounding ground level?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, while there is an artistic depiction of the railway, it doesn't show an elevation above the surrounding terrain. Instead, it appears almost level with the ground as the design blends with the surrounding art style.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the railway tracks converge toward a single point on the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the railway tracks are depicted as coming together and converging toward a vanishing point on the horizon, which aligns with the principles of linear perspective often used to create depth in artwork.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
