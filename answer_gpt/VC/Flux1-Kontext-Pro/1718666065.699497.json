        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the unicorn is depicted with four legs.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn is positioned in a manner where its body is angled to reveal more than just a side profile, capturing depth with its front facing slightly toward the right side. This suggests a three-quarter view orientation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn's head is slightly angled toward the viewer instead of being parallel with the body, revealing more of the left side which is another characteristic often seen in depictions of such fantastical creatures to add a sense of engagement or realism.",

      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
