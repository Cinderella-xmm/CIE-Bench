      "question": "Is the wide, straight avenue leading directly toward the base of the Eiffel Tower preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no wide, straight avenue leading directly toward the base of the Eiffel Tower. Instead, the edited image depicts a perfume bottle, which lacks any road or street features. This conclusion is drawn from the visual cues in Image B, as the bottle is a static and stationary object with no connection to the avenue in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the symmetrical rows of green trees lining both sides of the avenue preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a perfume bottle, which does not contain any trees or avenue-related features. The texture and patterns on the bottle do not depict the realistic elements found in Image A such as trees lining an avenue. This judgment is based on the observed elements in Image B, which are devoid of any botanical features.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the streetlights positioned along the sides of the avenue preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the streetlights present in Image A are not visible. The altered image focuses on a perfume bottle, which includes no clear depiction of streetlights. The reasoning is based on the absence of street-related details in the edited image featuring only the bottle.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the wet asphalt surface with visible reflections preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image presents a perfume bottle situated on a neutral and dry background. Therefore, the wet asphalt surface with reflections, evident in Image A, is not preserved in Image B. This conclusion is drawn from examining the edited image, whose elements do not include any wet surfaces.",

      "question": "Is the overcast sky with dark, layered clouds preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict any sky-related features, focusing instead on the image of a perfume bottle. Thus, the overcast sky with dark, layered clouds visible in Image A is absent in the edited image. The reasoning is based on the lack of atmospheric elements in the depiction of the bottle.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Is the distant Parisian skyline with identifiable rooftops and modern high-rises preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skyline characteristic of Image A is not present. The edited image focuses exclusively on a perfume bottle, which does not include architectural components such as rooftops and high-rises. The logic is based on analyzing the edited visual, which lacks any skyline features.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the vehicles, including cars and a bus, visible on the road in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, it is clear that the vehicles present in Image A are not visible. The edited image solely depicts a perfume bottle, eliminating any vehicular components. The assessment rests on the observation that edits in the image replace road and street elements with a singular product focus.",
