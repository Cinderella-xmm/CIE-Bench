      "question": "Does the bear retain its brown fur texture and color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear has soft, fluffy brown fur with a consistent texture typically associated with a teddy bear or a realistic plush design. World knowledge of bear fur indicates that they usually have a dense and natural texture, commonly exhibited by animals or animatronics in realistic representations. The observed brown fur in Image B aligns with this expectation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the bear depicted in an upright sitting posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bear sitting directly on its hind legs, with its body upright and front paws resting on the ground, which is a classic sitting posture. This is a common position for bears when they are not in motion and at rest. An upright posture means the back is straight rather than slumped forward or to the side.",

      "question": "Does the backpack retain its blue color and black straps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backpack is predominantly blue, and the straps are black. The color contrast is quite distinct, underscoring a popular color scheme for backpacks where the main compartment is blue and the straps provide a contrasting black hue. This matches the description provided in the question.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the backpack's black straps and buckles visible and intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual assessment of Image B reveals that the backpack's black straps and the buckle are clearly visible and appear fully functional and intact. Knowing that backpacks typically feature straps and buckles for security and adjustment supports the expectation that these components are present and in good condition in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear itself has dark eyes, a black nose, and rounded ears, which are characteristic features commonly seen in bears, whether represented in natural or artistic forms like plush toys or animations. These features are detailed and emphasize a bear's realistic or mimicked traits, aligning with typical bear anatomy.",
