    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the circular orb-web with clearly defined radial and concentric threads still present and structurally intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no orb-web present. The primary focus appears to be on a fantastical spider-like creature with luminescent wings and ornate details, set against an abstract background. There are no radial and concentric threads, which are characteristic of an orb-web. Hence, based on the visual information and knowledge of what constitutes an orb-web, it is clear that the web structure is not present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the branches positioned in a natural arc around the web, supporting it from multiple directions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no branches depicted at all. The composition centers on the creature and the abstract background without any natural elements like branches to support a web. Given the absence of branches, the answer is derived from the clear lack of visual cues indicating such structures.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the leaves retain their oval shape, visible venation, and glossy surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature any leaves. The focus is entirely on the decorative spider-like creature with wings, and as such, there are no elements resembling leaves, nor any details suggesting a natural textured surface like leaf venation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there small, clear water droplets visible on the surfaces of some leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since there are no leaves present in Image B, consequently there are no surfaces where water droplets could logically be visible. The absence of natural foliage in the image directs the conclusion that water droplets on leaves do not exist within this composition.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background a soft, uniform pale blue-gray sky without additional elements such as clouds or sun?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is not merely a pale blue-gray sky; instead, it includes dynamic swirling light and color, suggesting an abstract or fantastical setting rather than a simple, uniform sky. This visual information informs us that there is more in the background than just a plain blue-gray sky.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the webâ€™s radial threads visibly connected to the branch ends at multiple points?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no radial threads or branches depicted in Image B. The scene is primarily focused on the winged creature with an abstract or ethereal background. Thus, there is no evidence of any connections between webs and branches, as neither of these elements are present.",
