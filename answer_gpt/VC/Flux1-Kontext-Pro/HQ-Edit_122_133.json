      "question": "Is the cardinal’s body predominantly bright red with a black facial mask?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal is depicted in a human-like form wearing a red and beige dress with its head displayed but lacks a bright red body with a black facial mask. The bird’s human attire obscures its natural coloration, which is typically bright red with a black mask around its face. Hence, in this creation, the cardinal's body is not predominantly bright red with its characteristic black facial mask.",

      "question": "Does the blue jay have a blue crest and wings with alternating blue and white bars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue jay is anthropomorphized and dressed in human-like blue attire with a hat, making it difficult to observe the natural crest and wing pattern it typically possesses. As it's wearing clothes, its physical features like a blue crest and wings with alternating blue and white bars are not visible. In its natural form, a blue jay indeed has these features, but in this dressed-up version, they are not apparent.",

      "question": "Is there visible snow resting on the cardinal’s head and back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal, dressed in a red and beige dress, is situated in a winter scene within a box, with snow depicted on the environment, such as on the ground and surrounding trees, but not specifically on the cardinal's head and back as part of the attire. The bird's clothing covers any such details that might typically be seen. Therefore, snow resting directly on the cardinal's head and back is not observable.",

      "question": "Does the blue jay have a black beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue jay is dressed in a blue coat with a hat, and its beak is visible. The beak appears to be black, which aligns with the typical natural feature of a blue jay that possesses a black beak. The clothing does not obscure the facial feature of the beak in this image.",

      "question": "Are the birds perched on snow-covered pine branches with visible needles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal and blue jay are presented in a diorama-style display within two separate compartments, standing upright in human-like clothing, with small potted trees around them. They are not perched on branches, and instead of being on snow-covered pine branches, they stand on a snow-covered ground. There are no visible pine needles in the setup.",

      "question": "Does the cardinal have an orange-red beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal is styled in a dressed-up form with most of its natural features resembling clothing. However, its head and beak remain visible, showing the typical orange-red color associated with cardinals. This matches the natural known trait of cardinals having an orange-red beak, as not obscured by the costume.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the cardinal and blue jay are depicted in a wooden box with two vertical compartments, each housing one bird dressed in human attire. This setup indeed shows them being positioned in separate vertical sections, allowing for distinct and clear partitioning between the two birds.",
