      "question": "Is the carrot still bright orange in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot appears to retain its bright orange hue, which is consistent with the typical color of a healthy carrot. This conclusion is drawn from the high saturation and vibrancy of the orange color visible on the carrot. The bright color is a common indicator of freshness and ripeness in carrots.",

      "question": "Does the carrot maintain its conical shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot displays the regular conical shape that is characteristic of carrots. This is evident from its wide top and gradually tapering down to a narrow point, which is a standard shape for most cultivated carrots.",

      "question": "Are the green leaves still present at the top of the carrot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The carrot in Image B has green leaves sprouting from its top. The presence of these leafy greens is typical for carrots that are freshly harvested and adds a distinctive feature to the overall appearance of the carrot.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the carrot does seem visible, as it fits snugly into the substrate with the green leaves extending upwards. However, the visible roots, typically small fibers often seen on carrots pulled from soil, are not very prominent from the visible area of the image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the carrot still positioned upright in the substrate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The carrot in Image B remains upright as observed from its perpendicular alignment to the soil surface. The depiction of the carrot being vertically oriented is indicative of how carrots generally grow underground, thus maintaining its upright position.",
