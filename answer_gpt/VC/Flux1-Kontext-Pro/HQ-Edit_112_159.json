        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car is inside a glass display case, and its visual characteristics are evident. The headlights remain angular, akin to the McLaren 720S design, featuring distinct LED outlines. The grille intake is centrally located, emphasizing the sleek aerodynamic appearance associated with the McLaren 720S. This observation supports recognition rooted in prior knowledge of supercar designs.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a miniature version within a display case, visually depicting a road with two lanes, evident from the double yellow lines visible along the center. The curvature of the road mirrors typical highways, facilitating traffic flow in opposite directions while retaining the layout from Image A. This aligns with common road designs for such settings.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a miniature road inside the glass case, where the guardrail characteristic is evident on the right side, providing separation between the roadway and adjacent areas. This element remains consistent with typical highway designs seen in coastal settings, aimed at safety and alignment with structural norms.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a scaled-down version inside a glass case, where the car is positioned on the right side but slightly tilted rather than directly forwards toward the horizon. This representation demonstrates a variation in the positioning compared to Image A, focusing more on visual presence within a limited display space.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ocean and shore elements within the display case do not exhibit the detailed natural textures seen in Image A. This includes rocky outcrops or visible mist. The minimized depiction inside the case may limit insight into such intricate elements or barriers due to scale, hindering detailed analysis.",
