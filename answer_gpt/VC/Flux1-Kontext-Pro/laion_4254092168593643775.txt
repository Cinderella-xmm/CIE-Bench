    "Question": "Q1: Is the number '7' clearly visible on both the front fender and side panel of the motorcycle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, which features the motorcycle illustration on the can, we can observe that the number '7' is visible on the front fender and side panel of the motorcycle. The design is stylized, but the number is present and legible. This is deduced from the appearance of the numeral in an area typically reserved for such branding on motorcycles, especially in racing or sports contexts.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the track outline labeled '5/5' present in the upper-right corner of the image?",
    "explanation": "Image B is a stylistic illustration on a can, designed to depict energy or race-themed graphics. There is no depiction of a track outline labeled '5/5' in the upper-right corner. Instead, the focus is on the energetic and colorful design of the can's branding, which does not include such elements.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the dust trail originate directly from the rear wheel of the motorcycle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction is more illustrative and abstract, as seen on the can's design. While the motorcycle image implies motion, there is no detailed and realistic dust trail visible originating from any part of the motorcycle, especially from the rear wheel. The artwork aims to capture the essence of motion and speed through artistic means rather than detailed realism.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the rider depicted in a forward-leaning posture with hands gripping the handlebars?",
    "explanation": "In the image on the can (Image B), the illustration shows a rider on a motorcycle leaning forward with the hands appearing to grip the handlebars. This is typical of racing or aggressive riding postures and is reinforced by the dynamic, action-oriented style of the illustration on the can. The portrayal effectively captures this pose through artistic simplification.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the front wheel circular with a blue rim?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration on the can shows the motorcycle's front wheel as circular, which is a standard representation for wheels. However, the rim is part of a stylized depiction and not distinctly colored blue. The use of color in the can's design is purposefully varied for artistic effect, so it doesn't feature a clear blue rim like in realistic renditions.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q6: Is the rider positioned in the foreground with the desert landscape behind them and the track outline in the upper-right corner?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on the rider and motorcycle depicted prominently in a graphic style on the can. The background of this design does not include a specific desert landscape or a track outline in the upper-right corner. Instead, Image B features abstract and dynamic colors and patterns that represent energy and speed rather than a realistic setting.",
