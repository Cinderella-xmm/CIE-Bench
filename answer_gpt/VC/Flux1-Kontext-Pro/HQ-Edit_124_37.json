      "question": "Is the subject's skin tone still dark brown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's visible skin tone on her arms and feet appears to be dark brown. The color consistency and natural richness of the skin tone suggest a dark brown shade. World knowledge about skin tones in photographs or artistic depictions further supports the conclusion that the subject's skin tone remains dark brown.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the subject’s head tilted upward with her gaze directed toward the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's head appears to be in a neutral position, not specifically tilted upward. The pose does not indicate a characteristic angle where the gaze would be directed toward the sky. Combined with world knowledge of common head positions, the subject is not depicted with her head tilted upward.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are both arms extended outward with hands open and palms facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject’s arms are extended outwards where the hands hold onto the garment and do not feature open palms facing forward. By understanding common body language and poses, it is clear that the hands are grasping the garment rather than open. Therefore, her palms are not facing forward in an open gesture.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the subject have braided hair, even if stylized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hairstyle appears intricately woven or stylized, resembling braids. The visual cues suggest a pattern that aligns closely with braided hair styles, which are often depicted similarly in artistic works. Thus, the subject’s hair is consistent with braided hair styling.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lower portion of the garment flaring outward, suggesting motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower part of the garment is portrayed as flaring outward, which conveys a sense of movement. The way the fabric extends outward from the subject’s body gives the impression of motion or fluidity, akin to how garments behave when influenced by movement or wind.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the subject smiling with visible teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, facial features like a smile are normally indicated or emphasized, but the specific stylization does not show an open mouth or visible teeth that would convey a smiling expression. The subject is depicted in a serene, neutral manner rather than smiling.",
