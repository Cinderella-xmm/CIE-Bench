      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch face is white and the hour markers are black, providing a clear contrast for readability.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the watch placed on a surface that appears to be a wooden or tiled floor, typical of an indoor train station or similar structure, different from the white furniture-like surface seen in Image A. This indicates a change of setting and position, indicating the watch has been moved to a completely different environment.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting has shifted to a dimmer, more diffuse quality, typical of indoor lighting in spaces with large windows like train stations. The shadows are softer and less harsh compared to those observed in Image A. Initially, in Image A, the lighting was direct and bright with evident shadows on the white surface, indicative of natural lighting near a window, demonstrating that both lighting and shadows have undergone changes.",
