    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the sunlight originating from the upper-left portion of the sky, casting diagonal rays across the mountain range?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the sunlight streaming diagonally from the upper left, casting light across the landscape, which is consistent with the shadows and highlights suggesting the direction of light. The warm, glowing part of the sky with the sun is located in the top left corner, which is typically where sunlight sources are depicted in art. Given the common depiction of sunlight direction in visual compositions, the sunlight is indeed originating from there and casting diagonal rays.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible layers of mist or haze separating the mountain ranges at different depths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits distinct layers of mist or haze that create depth by separating various mountain ranges visually. It's a common atmospheric phenomenon that adds a sense of distance by obscuring objects further away. This layered look contributes to the mystical and expansive feel of landscapes in art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the tallest, most prominent peak located near the center of the image, rising above surrounding spires?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a notably tall peak towards the center, which stands out because of its height and unique spire-like formations that are typically seen in fantastical landscapes. This peak features dramatic vertical structures rising above other mountains visible in the frame, drawing attention as the central focus.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there green leafy plants visible in the foreground, especially on the left side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a fantastical environment with a large dragon occupying part of the frame, presumably replacing any natural foliage one might expect in a realistic scene. Unlike Image A where green plants are present, Image B focuses on the dragon and its environment, which lacks leafy vegetation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the sky display a gradient from warm orange-pink near the horizon to cooler blue-gray at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky exhibits a gradient transitioning from warm hues close to the horizon, where the sun seems to be setting or rising, to cooler, blue-gray tones towards the top. This creates a naturalistic transition often seen in both real sunsets and artistic depictions, enhancing the scene's depth and mood.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible rough, dark gray rock surfaces on the mountain sides, especially on the left and right edges of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses on a dragon and a fantastical setting, where the natural rough gray rock surfaces typical to realistic mountain scenes are not prominently visible. The focus is on the mythical dragon and the environment surrounding it, featuring stylized designs instead of rough and dark mountain formations.",
