    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the boots rendered in bright red color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boots are visibly colored in a bright red hue. Red boots are often depicted in popular imagery and can be recognized by their distinct and vibrant color, which stands out against other colors in the scene. The visual cues of the chibi-style illustration emphasize this color prominently.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dress retain the visible openwork crochet pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the dress in a solid white color with bold outlines, typical of chibi-style art, which simplifies details. Crochet patterns are intricate and involve openwork designs, requiring detailed rendering that is not present in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are white socks visible beneath the red boots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white socks are depicted extending above the top of the red boots, which is a common visual choice to provide contrast within character designs. This provides a clear indication that the socks are indeed present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is a small rectangular label visible on the side of the left boot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images display a small label on the upper side of the boots. In chibi designs, details like labels are kept for recognition and simplicity. The label's appearance in Image B confirms its presence as a stylistic and emblematic feature consistent with certain boot designs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is a silver-colored buckle present on the upper part of the right boot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, shows a buckle on the right boot, but it is outlined rather than colored metallic silver, aligning with how chibi art style simplifies objects to their basic forms and uses simple coloring.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the figure bent forward at the waist with hands positioned near the ankles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a chibi character in a forward-bending pose. The visual assessment shows the hands positioned near the ankles, intended to illustrate this posture effectively in a chibi format, which simplifies and exaggerates poses for cuteness and emotive impact.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the red boots extend below the hem of the white dress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red boots are clearly shown to extend below the hemline of the dress. This is a typical characteristic of knee-high boots, often used in fashionable or artistic representations.",
