    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no woman depicted with visible earbuds.

    "Question": "Q3: Are both the man and the woman shown in profile, facing to the right?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, only a man is visible, depicted from behind and facing what appears to be the right side of the frame.

    "Question": "Q4: Is the man’s right hand positioned near his ear, holding the earbud in a manner that mimics the woman’s use?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the man is holding something in his hand, but since there is no woman visible with earbuds, there's no reference to mimic. Moreover, the man does not appear to hold an earbud, hence his posture doesn't suggest any mimicking behavior associated with earbuds.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the top-right corner of the advertisement visibly torn or peeling, revealing the underlying surface?",

    "Question": "Q6: Is the man positioned in front of the advertisement, partially overlapping it?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the man is part of the main scene rather than positioned in front of a secondary advertisement the way a person might stand in front of a billboard. This scene depicts him holding a speech bubble, integrated within the narrative context. As such, he is not overlapping any advertisement; instead, he is part of it.",
    "answer": "No"
