      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which is a colorful depiction of a Ducati motorcycle in comic book style, the 'DUCATI' text is visible on the fuel tank rather than the down tube of a bicycle frame. In contrast, Image A, which depicts a Ducati bicycle, has 'DUCATI' text visibly along the down tube of the frame. Therefore, for Image B, the answer is No.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'DUCATI' text is positioned on the motorcycle's fuel tank and the image is illustrated in a comic style. There is no text visible on any seat stay. Image A (the bicycle) has text on the seat stay, but Image B does not feature this element as it is a different style altogether. Therefore, for Image B, the answer is No.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a motorcycle setup with a vibrant background and comic elements. There is no 'SPORT' text visible on the motorcycle. Image A has 'SPORT' on the top tube, but because Image B is about a different type of vehicle, the answer is No.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on a motorcycle with no visible word 'TECH' near any bottom bracket area since it is presented in a comic illustration style. Image A, featuring a bicycle, does contain 'TECH' on the frame. Due to the absence of this text in Image B, the correct answer is No.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration of a Ducati motorcycle indeed features a predominantly red frame, consistent with Ducati's typical color scheme. The motorcycle depicted is red. Since the query regards the coloring and not the vehicle type, the answer is still Yes for the motorcycle in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts handlebars visible on the motorcycle, which are black as part of the comic style illustration. A saddle similar to a bicycle is not visible, but the seat is also black in color. Combining this observation with world knowledge about the Ducati styling, the answer is Yes for Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a sporty motorbike, which includes chain-like elements typical in motorcycle designs connecting parts of the drivetrain. However, the focus is on taking inspiration from a motorcycle, not a bicycle with a cassette and crankset. An observable chain does exist in the drivetrain, but isn't explicitly similar to a bicycle setup, thus the answer is No for Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which is styled as a comic, the tires lack such silver reflective stripes. Instead, the tires appear as commonly solid with tread but are highlighted artistically without reflective stripes. Image A (a bicycle) showcases reflective sidewalls, but Image B does not have this feature, hence No.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a stylized illustration of a motorcycle with clear center hubs in its wheels, linking to its complex mechanical structures. Since the wheel's mechanics are typically shown, the answer for Image B is Yes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a motorcycle setup, featuring an open structural frame rather than the classic diamond shape found in bicycles. While motorcycles do not utilize this specific structure, the answer comparing to typical vehicle frames stemming from Image A means the answer is No for Image B.",
