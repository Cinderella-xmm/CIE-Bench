      "question": "Are the gingham accents on the cuffs and back bow still present and crisp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress has visible gingham accents on the cuffs and the back bow. These patterns are clearly visible and retain a crisp appearance, suggesting that their design and clarity have not been altered in the editing process. Since the gingham accents are a distinct pattern commonly used in fashion, it is expected to be maintained clearly if not specifically changed.",

      "question": "Does the dress retain its original structure with long sleeves, a gathered waistline, and a flared skirt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress still has long sleeves with a gathered waistline and a flared skirt, indicating that the basic structure of the dress remains unchanged. Long sleeves and a gathered waistline are key structural elements that define this type of dress, and despite any edits or design additions, these structural features are intact.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the \"Nebraska Huskers\" text area still located in the same position on the dress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Nebraska Huskers' text is located on the upper front part of the dress. Based on common placement for branding or logos on clothing, it would typically be positioned around the chest area for visibility, which is consistent with its original location. This is confirmed through comparison with Image A, where the same text position is noted.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the dress predominantly red, even if the shade has been deepened?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress is predominantly red, though the shade appears deeper or darker compared to standard red tones. This could be an intentional design choice to enrich the color but does not change the fundamental red nature of the dress. The original dress color (as seen in Image A) was also red, reinforcing the continuity in the main color across both images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the dress still have a gathered waistline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress clearly shows a gathered waistline which is a characteristic feature of the structure. The gathered waistline allows for a defined shape that flares out into the skirt, which is visible in the image. This aligns with the dress structure seen in Image A, confirming that the gathered waistline is an enduring design element.",
