      "question": "Is the clock frame still circular in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the frame of the clock can be seen as circular, which is evident by the rounded edge around the clock face. Circular is characterized by having a consistent, round edge, which is present here. A circular frame is visually similar to a ring or a disk, and the clock in Image B maintains these characteristics. Therefore, the frame's shape is still circular.",

      "question": "Do the proportions of the clock hands and line markers remain consistent with the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock hands and line markers appear to have similar lengths and thicknesses compared to conventional minimalist clocks. Both in Image A and Image B, the line markers are evenly spaced and thin, while the hands have a distinctive tapering fashion, which is consistent with minimalist clock design. Therefore, the proportions of the clock hands and line markers are consistent with the original.",

      "question": "Is the clock face still white with black line markers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face remains white, which is discerned from the bright and neutral background color of the clock. The line markers are black, maintaining a high contrast with the white face, which is a typical color scheme for clarity in clock designs. This coloring is consistent with a classic and minimalist clock aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there still no numerals on the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows no numerals on the clock face. Instead, there are simple black line markers indicating the hour positions, which is a minimalist design choice often used for a cleaner and more stylish appearance. This design is consistent with clocks that forgo numerals for simplicity.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the clock hands and markers positioned relatively the same as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the positioning of the hour markers and hands is consistent. The position of the hands, which indicate the time, is similar, with the hour hand slightly before the 5 o'clock position, the minute hand near 7, and the second hand pointing between 7 and 8. The line markers correspond to their respective positions on a clock face without any modifications.",
