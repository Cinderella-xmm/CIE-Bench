    {

      "question": "Is the \"Fujitsu fi-7160\" model name and logo visibly present on the top-left portion of the scanner in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the holographic display showcases futuristic and branded designs and text associated with the scanner. However, the model name \"Fujitsu fi-7160\" is not prominently visible on the top-left portion in the holographic rendering of the scanner. Instead, brand designs or logos suitable for modern branding are present in holographic integrations, which might not match exactly with Fujitsu’s branding from Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the automatic document feeder (ADF) tray open and holding multiple documents, including a boarding pass, receipt, and payment slip, in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic display in Image B focuses on the scanner itself rather than showcasing documents being scanned or held. Analyzing the display doesn't reveal physical documents like a boarding pass, receipt, and payment slip visibly held in an open ADF tray as seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the five control buttons (Menu, Stop/Clear, Scan/Enter, Power, and directional navigation) arranged in the same configuration on the right side of the scanner in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the holographic display does depict buttons on the scanner but with a futuristic design. Upon comparison with Image A, button labels and exact arrangement including directional navigation as shown on Image A may not be distinctly visible or highlighted similarly in Image B.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the power button illuminated in green on the right-side control panel of the scanner in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B with a focus on the holographic display, the power button illumination may creatively utilize futuristic lighting or design, but the specific illumination in green as seen in Image A is absent. The holographic effect doesn’t clarify green illumination specifically.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the row of bristle rollers visible beneath the scanning bed of the scanner in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the scanner in a stylized holographic box design without detailed interior features like bristle rollers beneath the scanning bed that are notable in Image A. In the holographic depiction, finer mechanical details are often abstracted away.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the boarding pass, receipt, and payment slip clearly visible in the ADF tray with readable text such as \"Boarding Pass\", \"Receipt\", and \"Payment Slip\" in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the holographic representation in Image B, the display focuses more on branding and futuristic tech vibes rather than specific document details as seen in Image A. The lack of physical documents and readable text like \"Boarding Pass\", \"Receipt\", and \"Payment Slip\" is evident upon examination.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the scanner in the holographic display maintain the original black and light gray color scheme of the Fujitsu fi-7160?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes a holographic design likely emphasizing tech aesthetics with neon and futuristic elements that divert from the real-life color scheme seen in Image A, specifically the black and light gray coloration of the Fujitsu fi-7160.",
