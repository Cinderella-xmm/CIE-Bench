    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the original woman's facial structure, including the shape of her eyes, nose, and mouth?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's face is blurred and therefore does not allow us to analyze or compare her facial structure, including the shape of her eyes, nose, and mouth with Image A. Given that we cannot make this visual comparison or recognize any specific features, we can conclude that the facial structure details are not retained for analysis in the edited image.",
