        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car is consistently shown with a red color across all four views presented in the image. The visual cues indicate a bright red hue, typically associated with this sports car, observed uniformly in each quadrant of the edited image. This color coherence suggests that the car is rendered in its original color in all views. World knowledge tells us that the red color is often used for Mustangs and other sports cars to emphasize their sporty appeal.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front view of the car displays a grille design with horizontal slats and the Ford Mustang emblem prominently placed in the center. Based on world knowledge about the standard design of a Mustang's front grille, it typically features these characteristics. Comparing with Image A, the grille design and emblem appear to be unchanged and in their standard positions, indicating the original design is retained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the car's LED daytime running lights in both the front and angled side views. The style of the LED lights, which often involves distinct vertical or horizontal strips near the headlights, is consistently visible. By using world knowledge, Mustangs commonly have these LED designs, and both views in Image B appear to maintain the same configuration and style as described in Image A.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car's alloy wheels can be seen in multiple quadrants. The design appears to be consistent with a multi-spoke pattern typical of sporty designs used on Mustangs. Comparing each view in Image B and referencing Image A, the wheels are visually identical across all displayed perspectives, exhibiting the same specific design and detailing.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the car from different angles: front, side, and rear views. The body shape appears consistent and the proportions appropriate for a Ford Mustang in each view. Using knowledge of typical Mustang design, which features a long hood, distinctive rear, and a sloping roofline, the edited image accurately represents these detailed features, indicating consistent proportions across all views, similar to what is seen in Image A.",
