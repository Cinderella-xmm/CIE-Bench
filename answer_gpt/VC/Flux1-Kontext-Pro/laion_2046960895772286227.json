      "question": "Is the floral/paisley pattern in red-brown tones with green trim present on the jacket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jacket features a subtle floral or lace-like textured pattern in a light beige color, with no visible floral/paisley pattern or red-brown tones with green trim. Commonly, a floral or paisley pattern is more intricate and colorful. Hence, the description doesn't match the visual cues seen.",
