    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the mustache present with its original shape, including upward curls at the ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the region where the mustache would be is blurred. Without being able to clearly view this area, I cannot determine the presence or shape of a mustache, including any specific features like upward curls. Based on available information, I can only conclude that it's not discernible.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both eyes visible and positioned symmetrically with the bridge of the nose aligned centrally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face region is blurred, obscuring the eyes and nose. Therefore, I cannot evaluate whether the eyes are symmetrically positioned or if the nose is centrally aligned. The analysis of symmetry and alignment is not possible under these conditions.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hairline clearly defined with a receding pattern at the temples?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the head region with a blurred face, but some interpretation of the hairstyle can suggest that the hairline might be visible. However, I cannot conclusively determine if there is a receding pattern at the temples due to the artistic style in Image B that might exaggerate or alter features.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bow tie located at the center of the neck, forming a symmetrical knot beneath the collar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bow tie is artistically stylized but still located at the neck's center. It visually aligns beneath the collar and appears reasonably symmetrical, indicating an attempt to maintain its traditional placement and shape despite the vibrant alterations.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the text \"S. W. Kramer.\" present below the image in the same font and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'S. W. Kramer.' appears below the image in Image B in a similar font and position as in Image A, suggesting the text placement was likely preserved in the edited version.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the subject’s head turned slightly to the left, with the body facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurred area in Image B does not allow for an accurate assessment of head orientation. However, judging by the positioning of the suit and collar, which remain consistent with forward-facing posture, the subject’s orientation is not easily assessed for any turn direction.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the image framed within a rectangular border with visible margins on all sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B show a framed image within a rectangular border, confirmed by the visible margins on each side, maintaining the traditional presentation format in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
