      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandwich is rendered in a cartoon style. The visual cues suggest a simplified depiction; however, we can still vaguely see indications of layered ingredients like lettuce and possibly cheese. The simplification inherent in the cartoon style may obscure finer details but does not completely eliminate visibility of the layers. The observer can discern that there are multiple ingredients involved due to hints of green (lettuce) and faint hints of other ingredients. Thus, based on common understanding of sandwiches and their depiction, the sandwich cross-section can be understood but is less clear than in a realistic image.",

      "question": "Does the sandwich bread retain its golden-brown crust appearance despite the cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandwich is drawn with a warm golden-brown color, which suggests a depiction consistent with a well-baked crust. The color choice in cartoons typically serves to convey identifiable traits of objects familiar to viewers. Despite the stylization, the choice of shading and color maintains the appearance of a crusty bread, aligning with typical features expected in real sandwich bread.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited cartoon-style Image B, the sandwich is placed on a depiction of a white, rectangular plate. The cartoon style involves simple lines and shading that outline the shape and color of the plate, retaining its position relative to the sandwich. By comparing with Image A, where the plate is clearly rectangular in a realistic style, Image B maintains this form in the simplified cartoon depiction.",

      "question": "Does the background still depict a wooden table surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a background that, despite the cartoon style, uses shades of brown with linear patterns that mimic the appearance of wood grain. This consistent use of texture and color in cartoons suggests an attempt to replicate the look of a wooden table, similar to Image A where the wooden surface is clearly visible. The simplified lines and color tones ensure it is still understandable as a wooden table.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the sandwich appears to be placed toward the center of the plate. Image B keeps the same relative positioning with respect to the size and shape of the plate, maintaining a central placement. The cartoon style does not alter the positional relationship, only the artistic depiction. Therefore, despite stylistic changes, the sandwich's position remains central to the plate.",
