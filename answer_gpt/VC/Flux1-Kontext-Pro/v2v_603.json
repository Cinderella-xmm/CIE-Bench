      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two figures are visible, and it can be seen that the skier on the left is wearing a red jacket while the skier on the right is wearing a blue jacket. This distinction is made clear by the different colors of their outerwear, which are visible despite the foggy atmosphere. Such clothing choices are typical for skiers to distinguish themselves and manage environmental conditions.",

        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Based purely on visual observation from Image B, both skiers are equipped with skiing poles and skis. Each skier is holding poles in their hands, and there are skis clearly visible attached to their feet. These are typical skiing equipment used for cross-country skiing. Such items help in mobility across snowy surfaces and are commonly associated with skiers.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both skiers appear to be carrying backpacks, and these backpacks are a dark color that can be identified as black. The darker backpack color contrasts with the lighter snow background, allowing for clear observation. Backpacks are common for people in such settings to carry essential items like hydration packs, snacks, or emergency gear.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a background scene that consists of snow-covered trees and a general snow-covered vista. The air is filled with fog, which is typical for a snowy forest setting. This matches the expected atmospheric conditions in a snowy forest, where condensation and snowfall contribute to limited visibility.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two skiers are positioned next to each other and seem to be progressing forward into the forested, foggy pathway. Their bodies and direction of movement imply that they are facing forward toward the center of the image, away from the viewer. This side-by-side positioning is common for individuals skiing together.",
