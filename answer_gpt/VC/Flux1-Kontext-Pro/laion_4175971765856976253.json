      "question": "Is the horseshoe-shaped grille with central mesh present on the front of the car and on the robot’s face/torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car features a distinctive horseshoe-shaped grille with a central mesh, which is characteristic of certain luxury vehicles. The robot, which is designed to transform from this car, has design elements that include the depiction of this grille on its face or torso region. This suggests that the transformed robot maintains key visual features from the car, such as the grille. This design consistency is often seen in transformer-like toys where shared design elements are carried through different transformation stages.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the side panels, front bumper, and door sections red, and the roof, hood, and lower body black?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the color scheme of the toy is such that the car's side panels, front bumper, and door sections are red, while the roof, hood, and lower body are black. This color combination is visually evident from the image and matches the typical color pattern seen on models that aim for sporty aesthetics. The robot retains this color theme which is indicative of a transformer toy's design.",

      "question": "Do both the car and robot feature five-spoke silver wheels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a close observation of both the car and the robot reveals the presence of silver wheels with a five-spoke design. Such wheel designs are common in toy cars and robot figures, emphasizing a sporty or mechanical look. The robot's feet, which incorporate these wheels, suggest that the model retains this wheel design in both its car and robot forms, indicative of their shared components during transformation.",

      "question": "Does the robot have gold-colored segmented armor plates on its chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot visible in Image B has distinct gold-colored segmented armor plates on its chest. These plates are a design feature that adds a mechanical and technical aesthetic to the robot, often seen in toy designs meant to suggest strength or advanced technology. The segmented appearance also closely aligns with the mechanical theme of the transformable toy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the robot’s arms formed from the car’s doors and fenders, and its legs from the car’s wheels and undercarriage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the design philosophy of transformer toys, the parts of the robot in Image B are likely derived from specific car components. The visible arms of the robot appear to be formed from the car’s doors and fenders, as these parts are the ones commonly articulated to function as arms in transformer designs. Similarly, the robot's leg structure, incorporating wheels and visible car undercarriage components, supports the transformation hypothesis.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the car positioned in front of the robot, with the robot standing upright behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the composition shows the robot standing in an upright position behind the car. This arrangement is typical in marketing materials and packaging for transformer toys, where the non-transformed vehicle is placed in the foreground, showcasing the product's dual nature.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On examining Image B, it is evident that there are no white stripes present on the front bumper, side panels of the car, or on the robot's shoulders and face. The entire color scheme mainly consists of black, red, and silver elements, without the inclusion of white stripes.",
