        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there are no horses present; instead, there is a plate of colorful macarons. Therefore, it is not possible for the horses to be brown with distinct markings. The visual information in Image B indicates a completely different subject matter.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there is no wire fence visible as the image entirely comprises a plate of macarons against a white background. Thus, there is no possibility of a wire fence being present between horses and the viewer.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not contain any grass or field but only a white swatch serving as a background to a plate of macarons. Therefore, the elements of green grass and field are not present here.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The imagery of a plate of colorful macarons on a plain white background lacks any rural context or elements that would contribute to a serene rural mood. Thus, the scene doesn't have any soft overcast lighting typical of an outdoor rural setting.",
