    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the original woman’s facial features, including the shape of her eyes, nose, mouth, and jawline?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the face is intentionally obscured preventing any assessment of facial features directly. To answer the question, the necessity lies in comparing visible facial attributes like the shape of the eyes, nose, mouth, and jawline in the original image against what is evidently unknown due to deliberate modifications in the edited image. Logically, it is impossible for the edited image to retain facial features since they are not visible.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the original woman’s skin tone preserved in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "The woman's skin tone, particularly focusing on visible areas like her arms, is observable in the edited image. Comparing the edited image to the original would typically include assessment of hue, saturation, and brightness consistent with the original skin tone. The edited image lacks visibility of the nuanced skin tone due to deliberate hiding of facial features and variables like lighting in the edited setting.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the edited image preserve the walking posture with the left leg forward and the right arm bent?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the posture is upright and symmetrical, distinctly different from an active walking pose depicted in the original image where physical movement with one leg forward and possibly one arm swinging is expected. The edited image shows a posture that stands still holding an object, implying the preservation of the previous walking posture is altered.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the hand positions preserved, with the right hand extended forward and the left hand near the hip?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, both hands hold an object symmetrically across the front, rather than being extended forward or held close to the hip as described in the original image. The change in context and posture in the edited image supports the observation that the previous hand positions are altered for holding an object.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the woman continue to look directly at the camera with the same gaze direction?",
    "explanation": "The focus direction of the gaze can typically be inferred from the position and orientation of the head and eyes. In the edited image, the woman’s face direction is obscured and cannot indicate any gaze direction, which precludes retaining the original gaze toward the camera.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the body shape and proportions of the woman preserved, including her slender frame and leg length?",
    "explanation": "The edited image portrays the woman in elaborate attire, which may obscure the specific details of her slender frame and the proportions seen in the original. While the posture and attire contribute to a different perception, the underlying body proportions and leg length, though less visible due to the garment, seem preserved in structural sense.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the original volume and curl pattern of the woman’s hair preserved, even if partially obscured or styled differently?",
    "explanation": "The edited image shows curly hair with a visible volume under a hat, consistent with the described curl pattern and volume of the hair from the original image. Regardless of any styling change or obstruction by hat, these characteristics maintain to a reasonable extent.",
    "answer": "Yes"
