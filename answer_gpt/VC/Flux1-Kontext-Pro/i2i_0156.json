      "question": "Are the printed texts on both open pages still clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texts on the book's open pages appear to be crisp and readable without any distortion or blurring. The clarity is such that individual letters and words can be easily distinguished, indicating that the printing is still clear. By using common knowledge, clear visibility would mean that the text doesn't have any smudging or fading which isn't the case here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the book cover still visibly pinkish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible portion of the book cover has a distinct pink hue. Although the cover itself is not prominently displayed, the edges visible in the image suggest a pinkish tint, aligning with the description of a pinkish book cover. Common color perception confirms that the shade observed is indeed within the pink spectrum.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the wooden background with its natural texture and grain patterns intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden surface in Image B displays clear grain patterns and natural texture that are typical of wooden surfaces. The characteristic lines and shades that denote wood are visible without any alteration or obstruction, suggesting that the texture and pattern are intact. This analysis relies on the visual elements that are distinct to wooden textures.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the book still open with the pages aligned logically on the wooden surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book is open with its pages laid out in a structured manner that logically aligns with how a book naturally rests when opened. The alignment is symmetrical and standard for an open book, where both sides are balanced and not disturbed. This understanding is based on the general behavior of physical books when placed open on a flat surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the pages retain their beige color and slightly aged texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pages in Image B portray a beige hue combined with a texture that appears aged, which is typical for older or well-used books. The visual presentation suggests a consistent tone and texture that aligns with paper that has been exposed to atmospheric conditions over time. These visual cues match what is expected from beige, slightly aged pages.",
