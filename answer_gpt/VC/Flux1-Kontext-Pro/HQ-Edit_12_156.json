      "question": "Does the structure retain four distinct legs forming a wide base that converge upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure depicted follows a similar design to the Eiffel Tower, which traditionally consists of four legs forming a wide base that converges upward into a single spire. The edited image maintains these structural elements as the legs visibly connect to form a singular edifice. Based on common architectural principles of such towers, the structural integrity is achieved through this design, and thus, visual cues indicate that the structure does retain this form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the tower’s shape vertically tapered, narrowing progressively from base to spire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a tower that visually tapers as it ascends from its base towards its topmost point. This form is consistent with the architectural design of the Eiffel Tower, which progressively narrows, providing stability and an aesthetic sense of reaching towards the sky. The tapering in the edited image is visually discernible as it outlines the structural narrowing typical of such tall edifices.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there three distinct horizontal levels or platforms visible along the tower’s height?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, upon close examination, the typical presence of three platforms associated with the Eiffel Tower's design is not prominently visible or highlighted. The visual representation emphasizes a more artistic and slightly abstract depiction, which does not clearly showcase these distinct horizontal platforms, differing from the real-life tower which has three observation decks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tower centrally positioned in the image, aligned with the center of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly positions the tower at the midpoint of the visual frame, ensuring it serves as the focal point of the image. By aligning the tower centrally, the composition directs the viewer’s attention directly upon it, leveraging symmetry which is often used in architectural photography and art to convey balance.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a straight, symmetrical pathway extending from the foreground directly toward the base of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a distinct pathway is prominently visible, extending from the foreground leading directly towards the base of the tower. This pathway enhances the symmetry of the composition and serves as a visual guide for the viewer’s eye from the base of the image up to the tower, which is a common element in scenic portrayal of monumental structures.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the light source (sun or equivalent) located directly behind the base of the tower, creating a halo effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a bright light source, most likely the sun or a similar entity, positioned at the base of the tower. This strategic placement results in a radiant glow surrounding the tower, often referred to as a halo effect. By placing the light source in this manner, the image achieves a dramatic and captivating visual effect, accentuating the prominence and grandeur of the tower.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a visible cityscape in the background, extending horizontally behind the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual elements in Image B present a continuous cityscape that stretches across the horizon line behind the tower, contributing depth and context to the scene. Such backdrops are typical in urban landscape illustrations to convey the bustling environment and situate monumental structures within their geographical context.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the tower significantly taller than all other structures in the image, dominating the vertical space?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower is clearly the predominant vertical element, towering over any other discernible structures within the composition. This hierarchy in relative height is an intentional design choice to underscore its significance and make the tower the primary subject dominating the vertical and visual space.",
