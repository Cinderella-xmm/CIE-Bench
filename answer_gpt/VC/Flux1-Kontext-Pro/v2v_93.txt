    "Question": "Q1: Does the thermometer retain its circular shape and metallic rim?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the thermometer's circular shape is maintained, which is apparent from the rounded perimeter of the face that aligns with our typical understanding of thermometers. Additionally, the metallic rim is discernible by its sheen and smooth texture, characteristic of materials like stainless steel or aluminum often used in gauge constructions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the temperature scale markings (-2°C to 200°C) clearly visible?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the temperature scale from -2°C to 200°C is clearly visible around the circumference of the thermometer. The numbers are in a bold font and evenly spaced, which makes them legible. Such clarity and positioning are vital for accurate readings and match the typical design of thermal gauges.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the needle present and positioned correctly relative to the temperature scale?",
    "explanation": "The needle in Image B is present as a black indicator within the thermometer, pointing at 0°C. The placement of the needle corresponds correctly with the temperature scale, adhering to the general functionality of thermometers where the needle aligns with the numerically indicated temperature readings.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the text 'TEMPERATURE' still visible in the center of the thermometer?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'TEMPERATURE' appears prominently in the center region of the thermometer's face, helping to identify the function of the gauge clearly. The visibility is maintained, allowing for easy identification, which is a common practice in labeling measuring devices.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the thermometer retain a white face for clear visibility of the markings?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays the thermometer with a white face, contributing to the contrast needed between the background and the dark numerical markings around it. This design choice ensures that the scale is visible and easy to read, adhering to the standard design principle for gauges to enhance readability.",
    "answer": "Yes"
