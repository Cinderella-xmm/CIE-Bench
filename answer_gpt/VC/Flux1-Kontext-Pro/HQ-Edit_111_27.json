        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the geisha with an intricately styled updo featuring multiple golden hairpins, floral ornaments, and embellishments hanging down, reflecting the traditional hair styling of geishas or similar figures.

      "question": "Does the geisha have a white-painted face with red lips and darkened eye makeup?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a blurred face, so detailed facial features like makeup cannot be confirmed visually. Typically, geishas are depicted with white-painted faces and distinct makeup, which suggests these features may exist under the blur. However, due to the lack of visible details, the question cannot be accurately answered based solely on Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fan in Image B is depicted in the geisha's left hand based on its orientation from the viewer's perspective. Typically, fans are held with one hand, providing additional charm and elegance to the geisha's pose and outfit. Visual confirmation of the hand holding the fan is identifiable through careful observation of the positioning and anatomy of the depicted figure.",

      "question": "Are the cherry blossoms arranged in an arching pattern above and below the geisha?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no cherry blossoms arranged in an arching pattern above and below the geisha. Instead, the image depicts a tree with branches that extend around but not necessarily forming an arch. Understanding the composition and placement of natural elements, like cherry blossoms, helps identify their arrangement in context with the figure portrayed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geisha is shown with a large red bow tied at the back of her kimono, which is visible due to its prominence and distinct red color within the apparel. The bows are traditional in kimono designs, often used to enhance the visual appeal of the garment, which aligns with the cultural depiction of geishas. Observing the distinct accessory aids in identifying its presence and significance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the geisha in profile with her head slightly turned downward, although her body appears to be facing to the left rather than to the right. The pose of a geisha is vital for conveying a sense of reserved elegance, and deducing the directional cues of the body helps in understanding the orientation and portrayal of the figure.",
