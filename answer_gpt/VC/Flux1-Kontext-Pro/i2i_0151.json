      "question": "Is the kite depicted in the shape of a diamond?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kites displayed on the cards and cutouts are diamond-shaped. This can be determined from the outline and symmetry of the shapes, which match the traditional diamond kite design. A diamond kite is typically identified by its two diagonal lines forming a symmetrical quadrilateral, which is visible in Image B. Therefore, the kites in Image B are in the shape of a diamond.",

      "question": "Does the kite retain its bright yellow color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kite representations maintain a bright yellow color. This is evident from the consistent vibrant yellow hue used throughout the cutouts and imagery displayed on the cards. Yellow is often a color that easily stands out, which matches the observed vibrant color of the kites in the image.",

      "question": "Are two strings visibly attached to the kite?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kites do not visibly have two strings attached. The kites shown in both the cutouts and the card illustration only present a single string each, typical for traditional kite designs. This indicates that there are not two strings attached to any of the kites in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the card illustration shows kites against a clear sky with some cloud elements, which creates the impression of these kites flying. This background, combined with the depiction of kites in an airborne position, suggests that the appearance of flight against a sky background is indeed present, aligning with common artistic representations of kites.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the standalone kite cutout and the kites in the card illustration possess a yellow tail. The presence of the tail is consistent with traditional kite structure, serving a functional and aesthetic role. These tails are apparent in their depiction alongside the kites in Image B.",
