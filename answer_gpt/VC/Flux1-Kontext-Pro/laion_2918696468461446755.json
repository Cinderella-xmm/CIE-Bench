      "question": "Is the mechanical eyepatch with visible screws and metallic surface present on the central character’s right eye?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central character is depicted in a typical noir style, wearing a detective-like hat and coat. Eyepatches or any mechanical gear are not evident in this style, which contrasts sharply with the sci-fi theme in Image A. The lack of visible detail characteristic of a mechanical eyepatch in the monochromatic, stylistic depiction of character B matches common portrayals of detectives without additional technological accessories. Thus, the mechanical eyepatch on the central character’s right eye typically associated with other story themes is absent.",

      "question": "Is the central character holding an open book in both hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central character is standing with a posture typical of noir detective aesthetics. Holding an item like an open book would be explicitly noticeable due to the style's emphasis on mysterious and thoughtful characters, usually seen with props that emphasize investigation, like magnifying glasses or cigarettes, not books. Thus, they are not holding an open book in both hands, based on common visual codes for detectives.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there visible Chinese-style calligraphy on the cover of the book held by the central character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B adheres to a noir theme with a detective motif. This style usually lacks distinct cultural or language markers such as Chinese-style calligraphy, particularly when items like books are not featured prominently. Based on this and the absence of any visible writing properties akin to calligraphy that would distinguish the book, there is no Chinese-style calligraphy visible.",

      "question": "Does the central character have short, straight black hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central character is depicted with a hat obscuring most typical hair view. However, within the noir context, it is common for characters to have neat, slick hairstyles which may seem black in the dark tones used. This aligns with detective archetypes, although the full hair view is not possible. Therefore, such a noir illustration likely implies short, straight black hair under the hat.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there four distinct supporting characters visible in the background, including one with white hair, one with purple hair, one with blue hair, and one with dark hair and red eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, supporting characters blend into a stylized silhouette against a mysterious backdrop, characteristic of film noir, focusing more on mood than distinct character traits like hair color. The absence of distinct vibrant hair colors and emphasis on shadow play common in noir means these styles are not evident.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the central character have a calm, neutral facial expression with a slightly downward gaze?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, aligning with noir styling, likely shows the character with a contemplative or neutral contemplation typical of detective figures, who exude stoicism as they analyze clues. The slight downward gaze can be interpreted as a reflection of the serious tone often seen in such genres though the exact expression isn't visible due to blur.",
