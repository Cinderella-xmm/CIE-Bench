      "question": "Is the wall behind the objects still light blue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall behind the objects has a light blue color. This conclusion is drawn by visually observing the hue and texture of the wall behind the knight figures, which appear consistent with a pale blue tone. World knowledge tells us that such neutral pastel blue tones are frequently used in nursery or children's room decor, and the visual cues do not suggest any change in color.",

      "question": "Does the white crib with vertical bars and a curved headboard remain in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crib with vertical bars and a curved headboard is visible to the right side of the image. Visual cues show the consistent presence of the crib in the same location as in Image A. The elements of the crib design, such as the straight vertical bars and the gentle curve of the headboard, are clearly distinguishable.",

      "question": "Is the crib mattress still patterned with yellow and gray cloud designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crib mattress in Image B displays a pattern that includes yellow and gray designs, suggestive of cloud shapes which are typical and recognizable in nursery motif patterns. This identification is supported by the visual observation of shapes on the mattress that maintain the same style as in Image A.",

      "question": "Are the new figures (medieval knights) still positioned along the wall near the crib, maintaining their relative alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The medieval knight figures in Image B are positioned along the wall in a similar arrangement as the toys in Image A, indicating that their relative alignment and position near the crib have been unchanged. This conclusion comes from analyzing the spatial configuration, where the knights are similarly lined up side by side along the wall.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floor has a beige carpet extending under the objects and crib. The carpet color is confirmed through visual examination, where the light brownish hue of the floor covering integrates with the room's soft and neutral color scheme, common in indoor spaces like nurseries.",
