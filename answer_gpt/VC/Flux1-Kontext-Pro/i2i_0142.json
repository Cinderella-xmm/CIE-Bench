      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image presents multiple angles of the glove and ball, showing the glove's open pocket and rounded edges, characteristic of a 3D shape. The baseball is round and depicted inside the glove in one of the views, emphasizing its 3D nature. The images maintain the dimensional attributes expected from such physical objects.",
