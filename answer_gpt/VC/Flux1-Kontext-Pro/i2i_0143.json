      "question": "Is the \"PARKING\" label clearly visible on the parking meter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parking meter displays a dome-shaped top section where the word 'PARKING' is printed. This label is clearly visible and legible. Based on common knowledge of how parking meters are designed, such labels are intended to be prominently displayed for users. The lighting in the image, though bright, does not obscure the text enough to make it unreadable.",

      "question": "Does the sticker on the parking meter display the text \"ComsiAcara\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a sticker on the main part of the parking meter that contains text, including 'ComsiAcara.' This is confirmed by examining the enlarged view of the sticker area through visual cues, where the text remains legible despite possible variations in font or colors. Knowing how promotional stickers or information labels are arranged typically, this label contains essential information and is visible upon inspection.",

      "question": "Is the parking meter securely attached and standing upright on a pole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parking meter is mounted on a pole and appears stable, balanced, and vertically aligned. This can be deduced from its perpendicular position relative to the road surface and its fixed positioning, which is a common characteristic for such installations to ensure functionality and durability.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the parking meter retain its original size and structural proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the parking meter has a typical size and structure consistent with standard public parking meters. Its proportions look natural and similar to what is commonly expectedâ€”without signs of distortion or alteration in scale. Comparing the two images, the dimensions and proportions of the parking meter are unchanged, further supporting the observation and maintaining its expected form and function.",

      "question": "Is the shadow of the parking meter visible on the ground beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the bright environment, the parking meter does not show a visible shadow on the ground. This absence can be due to multiple factors, such as lighting angle, which might cause the shadow to be cast away or merged with other visual elements. Knowing how shadows form relative to light direction, this particular arrangement suggests that the shadow isn't prominently or visibly cast on the ground below.",
