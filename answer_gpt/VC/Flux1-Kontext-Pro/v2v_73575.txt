    "Question": "Q1: Is the image composed of two separate panels, with one bird on the left and one on the right?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, visual observation reveals two separate panels. The left panel contains one bird, and the right panel contains another bird, indicating a division into distinct sections for each bird. This segmentation is clearly visible and helps organize the composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the bird that was originally on the left still located in the left panel, and the bird that was originally on the right still located in the right panel?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, we see a paper origami bird and a crystalline bird in their respective panels. Image A featured two real birds, where the left panel had a bird with a lighter color, and the right had a bird with darker markings. The transformation to artistic representations of birds maintains the position in their respective panels—paper origami on the left and crystalline on the right—suggesting the birds are in the same panel as they were originally.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the bird on the left have its head turned toward the viewer, with its beak slightly open and facing forward?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bird on the left is a paper origami figure with a forward-facing beak, but the beak is not open because origami representations do not have the functionality of opening parts. The origami's angular design suggests the head is pointed in an alert, forward-facing angle, but the beak remains closed due to its construction.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the bird on the right have its body angled such that its back is partially visible and it is facing left?",
    "explanation": "The bird on the right in Image B is represented with a crystalline structure, facing left with its outline suggesting visibility of parts of the body that could imply the back. The slightly turned position resonates with directional setting to the left side, but the transparency of the material may not clearly define visible parts like a back.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the feet of both birds clearly shown gripping a surface beneath them?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both birds are perched on intricate chess piece pedestals. The paper bird, despite being an origami, shows a design element acting as feet gripping the pedestal firmly, similar with the crystalline bird, whose transparent feet achieve a similar gripping concept on its pedestal. Therefore, they both show interaction with their supportive surfaces effectively.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do both birds maintain an upright, balanced silhouette with a distinct head, body, and tail?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the paper origami bird on the left has an upright stance with defined segments representing head, body, and wings. The crystalline bird maintains its upright, balanced silhouette with distinguishable features for head, body, and tail. Their artistic designs preserve clear balance and identifiable sections typically found in birds.",
    "answer": "Yes"
