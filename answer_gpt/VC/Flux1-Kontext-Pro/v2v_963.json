      "question": "Are the sausages rendered in a reddish-brown color consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Campfire Memories' box contains chibi figures and miniature campfire elements, not sausages like in Image A. The visual focus is on toys rather than food items, indicating the absence of sausages. Therefore, there are no sausages to compare in terms of color.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the sausages display parallel dark grill marks along their length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Campfire Memories' box contains chibi figures and a toy campfire, not sausages with grill marks like in Image A. Consequently, there are no sausages to check for grill marks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the sausages exhibit a glossy, reflective surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a wooden box with chibi figures and a toy campfire, not the glossy sausages seen in Image A. Therefore, the concept of sausage surfaces does not apply here.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there exactly three sausages present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no sausages depicted, only a box with three chibi figures. In Image A, there were three sausages, but this setup doesn't translate to sausages in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is each sausage attached to a metal skewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The items in Image B do not include sausages or metal skewers but rather focus on the visual theme of toys and a box labeled 'Campfire Memories.' Hence, skewered sausages are not present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the sausages show slight bulging at their ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B contains no sausages or any edible items, there are no bulging ends to observe or compare for sausages.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given that Image B lacks any depiction of sausages, the inquiry into reflective highlights on sausages is irrelevant in this context.",
