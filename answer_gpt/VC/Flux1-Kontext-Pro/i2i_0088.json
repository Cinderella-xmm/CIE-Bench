      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the napkin appears to retain its original dark blue hue, similar to Image A. This conclusion is drawn based on the consistent color intensity and tone of the fabric in both images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the napkin displays distinct fabric creases and texture that appear consistent with those seen in Image A. This observation is based on the visible folds and shadows on the fabric surface in both images.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spoon in Image B is positioned centrally on the napkin, matching the placement of the fork in Image A. Both utensils are aligned along the length of the napkin, suggesting the spoon occupies the same spot as the fork.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background retains the same solid dark blue color as seen in Image A. This conclusion is based on visual comparison, showing a consistent color plane without variations or patterns.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting and shadows on the spoon in Image B are consistent with those on the fork in Image A, with a similar directional light source indicated by the highlights and shadows on both the utensil and the napkin.",
