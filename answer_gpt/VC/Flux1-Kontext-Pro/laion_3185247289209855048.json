      "question": "Are the eyes green in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the section that would typically display the eyes is blurred, making it impossible to determine their color. Thus, based solely on visual analysis and without additional inference, the answer is 'No'.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the lipstick applied in a rich red shade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features, including lips, are obscured by a blur effect, preventing any determination of lipstick color. Hence, the answer is 'No'.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The orientation of the eyes and facial direction is obscured by the blur in Image B, making it impossible to analyze the gaze direction. The answer is therefore 'No'.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the left shoulder bare and visible in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the left shoulder is exposed, visible, and clearly illuminated in the foreground, which indicates that the shoulder is bare and prominently visible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a pinkish, fluffy texture is visible at the bottom left corner of the image. This aligns with common textures such as clothing or fabric often seen in portraits.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there soft highlights on the cheekbones and jawline created by directional lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the blurring effect, any highlights on the cheekbones and jawline cannot be discerned, so it's not possible to confirm the presence of such highlights. The logical answer, given the lack of visible detail, is 'No'.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the facial features symmetrically aligned with balanced spacing between the eyes, nose, and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features in Image B are obscured by a blur, preventing any analysis of their symmetry or spacing. Hence, it's not possible to determine the alignment of facial features, leading to a 'No' answer.",
