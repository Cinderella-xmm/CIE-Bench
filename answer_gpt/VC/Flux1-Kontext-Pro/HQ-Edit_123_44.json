    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the U.S. national insignia (white star within a blue circle, flanked by red and white bars) present on the wings and fuselage of the aircraft?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the aircraft model inside the display case has U.S. insignia painted on the underside of the left wing and visible on the fuselage, featuring a white star within a blue circle, flanked by bars. This insignia is commonly found on U.S. military aircraft. In Image A, the planes have similar insignia. Based on the insignia's depiction in both images, it is present in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there two radial engines mounted beneath the wings of the aircraft, one on each side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a model aircraft with two engines mounted beneath the wings. They are symmetrically placed, one under each wing, confirming the typical setup for this type of aircraft. Image A shows the same configuration. Combining this information, Image B has two radial engines mounted beneath the wings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does each engine have a three-bladed propeller attached to its front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each radial engine on the model aircraft has a propeller visible with three blades attached to its front, typical for military aircraft similar to that depicted. Image A also shows each engine having a similar three-bladed propeller. This confirms that Image B has engines with three-bladed propellers.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a rounded, transparent cockpit canopy located at the front of the fuselage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates a rounded cockpit canopy at the front of the model's fuselage, typical for aircraft where transparency allows visibility for pilots. This detail seems consistent with initial expectations for aircraft design. Analyzing Image A, the same feature exists, confirming the presence in Image B.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the wings extend straight and symmetrically from the fuselage, forming a dihedral angle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the wings extend directly from the fuselage without an apparent dihedral angle; they appear flat and symmetrical, a common design choice for such models. Image A shows a similar configuration, affirming the non-dihedral angle in the edited image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question": "Is the tail section composed of a vertical stabilizer and two horizontal stabilizers with small fins at the ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the model aircraft's tail section composed of one vertical stabilizer and two smaller horizontal stabilizers, each with little fins at their ends, indicative of this type of aircraft design. In Image A, the tail section matches this description, reinforcing the observation in Image B.",
