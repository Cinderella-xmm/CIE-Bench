        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure depicted is a teddy bear, not a girl. The teddy bear is wearing glasses, which are identifiable as being part of its face, along with its snout and ears. Therefore, the question about a girl does not apply here, leading to the conclusion: No.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The teddy bear in Image B is clad in a white lab coat. While the coat is indeed white and has buttons, this does not apply to a girl as the figure is a teddy bear. Thus, the analysis shows that despite the lab coat having visible buttons, the answer concerning a girl is: No.",
