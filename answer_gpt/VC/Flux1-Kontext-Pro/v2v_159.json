      "question": "Are the sneakers still beige with white soles and laces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sneakers are visually confirmed to be predominantly beige with contrasting white soles and laces. This observation is made based on the clear color contrast visible in Image B. This assessment, using visual analysis, leads to the answer.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is one foot slightly lifted as if taking a step?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts both feet resting flat on a shelf structure with no indication of motion such as lifting or stepping. Based on the positioning and shadows visible under both shoes, it appears that both feet are grounded. Therefore, analyzing the posture and visual cues from Image B leads to the conclusion.",

      "question": "Are the pants still beige in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pants are clearly beige, similar to the color depicted in Image A. Identifying the color requires recognition of shades and hues that match the neutral, warm tone typical of beige. Therefore, the color consistency observed in both images supports the answer.",

      "question": "Are the socks still white?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visual examination of Image B shows the socks as a bright, consistent white, with no apparent color changes or deviations. White socks are recognizable due to their lack of color and high contrast against other shades. Therefore, based on visual confirmation, the answer is derived.",

      "question": "Is the background still primarily composed of clouds, even if transformed into a shelf shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a background that is clearly a shelf structure rather than a formation of clouds. The straight lines and flat surfaces seen in Image B are characteristic of shelves, not clouds, which are typically soft, fluffy, and irregular. Analyzing the geometric properties indicates the absence of clouds.",
