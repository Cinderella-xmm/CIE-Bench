    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the vessel positioned in the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vessel is placed slightly off-center, more towards the right side of the image. This observation is based on the visual balance in the composition, where the vessel is more prominent on the right half of the image rather than being equidistant from both the left and right edges.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a circular tray directly beneath the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vessel is indeed placed inside a circular structure which appears as a tray. This observation comes from identifying the round base that matches the curvature of the vessel and viewing the edge that extends outward as a rim, common in vessel-tray sets.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does vapor or smoke originate from the top opening of the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is visible smoke or vapor emanating from the top small opening of the vessel. This is clear from the wispy white trails rising upwards, characteristic of smoke or steam which typically indicates a hot substance inside.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the vessel have a conical or upward-tapering shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vessel in Image B displays a shape that tapers upwards, making it look conical. This form is identified by the gradually decreasing circumference as it extends from the base to the top, which is typical of conical structures.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the vessel placed on a flat, patterned fabric surface that covers the visible ground plane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vessel in Image B is placed on a flat surface covered by a patterned fabric. The horizontal expansiveness of the textile and its patterned design covering what appears to be a table or flat plane suggest this setup.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a small opening at the top of the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a narrow opening at the apex of the vessel, from which smoke or vapor is emanating. This precise feature confirms that the top of the vessel has a small opening.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the tray made of a material visually similar to the vessel (e.g., terracotta)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the tray and vessel appear to be made from the same material, which is not terracotta but rather a metallic or ornate ceramic with a decorated surface. The consistency in design and pattern indicates they are made of similar or matching materials.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Does the fabric beneath the vessel display a structured geometric pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fabric in Image B, upon which the vessel sits, shows a prominent geometric pattern composed of various colors arranged in organized shapes and forms. This structured design is typical of geometric print textiles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
