      "question": "Does the edited image retain the platinum blonde hair with visible waves and braided sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hair is platinum blonde, stylized with visible waves and braided sections. These characteristics are consistent with hairstyles that are often used to convey a regal or noble appearance. This aligns with common historical portrayals where intricate hairstyles are used to denote status or character traits. Hence, Image B retains these hair aspects.",

      "question": "Are the facial features, including the jawline and eye shape, accurately preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features, including the jawline and eye shape, are not clearly visible or preserved well due to the blurring effect deliberately applied to the face. The blurring specifically obscures these features, preventing an accurate assessment of facial preservation, thus not maintaining these features accurately.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the subject depicted in a standing position with a slightly bowed head and hands clasped in front of the waist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the subject standing with hands held in front, which common posture suggests a poised or contemplative stance, although it does not clearly depict the head in a slightly bowed position. The artist's intention or cultural context often influences such postures in historical or theatrical representations; however, the head position is not evidently bowed in Image B.",

      "question": "Is a dagger present in the subjectâ€™s hands, held vertically with both hands clasping it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hands are clasped in front of them, but there is no visible dagger or sword being held. Instead, the hands are empty, which suggests that the subject is perhaps involved in a non-combative role or a more regal presentation, where such objects might be omitted to convey character or status.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject stands centrally amidst a particular group of figures observed to be positioned around her, extending into the background. This arrangement of surrounding figures is often used to emphasize the subject's prominence or importance within the scene, signaling a strategic composition to highlight central presence in various forms of art or cinema.",
