        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl behind the blurred area is part of a physical toy representation inside a display case. Despite the blurred face, the visible parts of the owl in Image B show the same brown and white feather pattern as depicted in Image A. This conclusion is based on the visible parts of the owl's body, which remain unchanged between the illustrations and the toy version.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl's face is blurred, making specific features like the yellow eyes and black beak indiscernible. Therefore, despite knowledge of typical owl features, it is not possible to confirm their presence in the edited image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl in the toy representation inside the display case is clearly wearing a graduation cap. This cap is the same style as in Image A, which is a common depiction of intellectual or scholarly themes associated with owls.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the blurring of the face, the owl can still be seen holding a rolled-up diploma tied with a yellow ribbon. This feature is clearly visible and matches the owl's depiction in Image A, indicating that this part of the image remains unchanged.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no evidence of books beneath the owl as seen in Image A. Instead, the owl is presented inside a display case on a labeled base, suggesting a shift from the illustration to a collectible toy form. This indicates that the books are no longer part of the composition in Image B.",
