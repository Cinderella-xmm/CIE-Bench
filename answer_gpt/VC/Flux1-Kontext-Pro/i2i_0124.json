      "question": "Does the image retain the cylindrical, elongated shape of the baseball bats?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the style has shifted to an artistic and painted representation, the baseball bats retain their cylindrical and elongated shapes. The visual cues in the illustration, such as the rounded barrel ends and tapered handles, align with the typical shape of baseball bats. World knowledge about the standard structure of baseball bats—comprising a long cylindrical body—supports the conclusion that this characteristic is retained.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the black taped handles of the bats still distinctly visible against the wooden shafts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration clearly depicts the black taped handles that contrast with the lighter, wooden color of the bat shafts. This color distinction between the handles and the shafts is evident, maintaining the visibility of the handles as separate entities. The rule of artistic representation ensures that certain key features will remain identifiable, especially when they serve as contrast elements.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the two baseball bats remain parallel to each other in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the painted style of Image B, the two baseball bats continue to be depicted as parallel, as indicated by the consistent spacing from base to tip. Despite the artistic rendering, the bats are aligned in a manner that signifies parallelism, supporting this observation. Knowledge of perspective and parallel line depiction in art assists in making this judgment.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the bats still placed on a grassy surface, indicating an outdoor setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses an illustrative style to depict a grassy surface under the bats. The green hues and texture imply grass, suggesting an outdoor setting. This characteristic is consistent with the expected visual of the natural field environment, which baseball bats are commonly associated with.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bats maintain their slight angle toward the viewer, preserving perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bats with a slight perspective angle towards the viewer, as seen in the diminishing size towards the handles, which is a technique used to imply depth. Despite the artistic conversion, this perspective is preserved through the tapered shapes of the bats, aligning with knowledge of how perspective operates in art.",
