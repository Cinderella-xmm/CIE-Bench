    "Question": "Q2: Is the glass panel of the clock clearly visible, showing the pendulum and weights inside?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the grandfather clock is illustrated with a focus on the external decorative wooden elements, and the level of detail is reduced in comparison to Image A. The sketch does not clearly depict the glass panel or the pendulum and weights with the same precision as a photograph would, as the emphasis is more on the outline and structure rather than transparency. Therefore, while the clock is present, the glass panel and internal view are not clearly visible.",
