      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a necklace that appears to have a metal base with a darkened, oxidized silver finish, evident through the contrast visible in the engraved designs.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snake tail is seen curving within the bell jar display but not specifically around a mannequin's neck. In contrast, Image A shows the snake tail wrapping around the left side of the necklace display mannequin. Therefore, Image B does not maintain the original positioning seen in Image A.",
