      "question": "Is the circular gold-tone MK logo charm present and clearly visible on the model’s attire or accessories?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine the presence of the circular gold-tone MK logo charm, I examine the visual aspects of Image B. The visual cues, such as accessories or attire details, should reflect this charm distinctly. Based on Image B, there is no indication of attire or accessories, as the image is completely black. Therefore, considering common visual occurrences of charms on attire or accessories is irrelevant here, as there is no such reflection in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the \"MICHAEL KORS\" brand name visible in gold uppercase letters near the upper right area of the model’s attire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In terms of visual cues, recognizing text details on clothing requires clear visibility. Image B shows no discernible text or clothing detail, as the image is completely black, which means that there's no possible presentation of the MICHAEL KORS brand name in any form on attire or elsewhere.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the model’s dress feature a black pebbled texture resembling the original bag’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "This involves identifying textural detail in the model's dress that mirrors the handbag's black pebbled surface. Image B, being entirely black, does not present any dress or textured surface, making it impossible to observe or analyze such qualities.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are gold-tone hardware elements (such as buckles, zippers, or clasps) visibly incorporated into the model’s accessories or outfit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "This question seeks to verify the presence of gold-tone hardware which may include buckles or clasps. Given that Image B is completely black with no visible outfit or accessory details, it's not possible to find such elements.",

      "question": "Is a zippered pocket with a gold-tone pull visible on the side of the model’s dress or outfit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "An analysis of Image B should show if there's a zippered pocket with specific gold-tone features on attire. However, Image B is fully black and lacks any visual suggestion of attire or pockets, making it impossible to locate such features.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the curved handle shapes reflected in the model’s arm or posture alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In assessing whether the curved handle shapes from the original image are mirrored in the model's posture or alignment, Image B must show such aspects. However, being entirely black, Image B has no visual representation or context of arms or posture shapes, precluding any reflection of curved handle shapes.",
