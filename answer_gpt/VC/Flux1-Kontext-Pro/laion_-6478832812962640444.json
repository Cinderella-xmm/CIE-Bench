    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the toe box of the boot rounded?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, observing the toe box, I can see it is not rounded but rather has a squared-off appearance. This conclusion is drawn from the geometric shape of the front of the boot, which has flat sides rather than a curved, rounded shape common in traditional round toe boxes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the boot have a V-shaped opening at the top of the shaft?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the boot with a clearly defined V-shaped opening at the top of the shaft. This is evident through the two sloping edges that meet at a point creating a V, which is a common design choice for cowboy boots.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a continuous white piping running vertically along the outer side of the shaft from the heel to the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any visible white piping running vertically along the outer side of the shaft. This observation is made by looking for any contrasting or additional linear detail along the side of the boot shaft, which is absent.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are decorative patterns present on both the upper shaft and the vamp area of the boot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, decorative patterns are visible on both the upper shaft and the vamp area of the boot. These patterns include stitched or embossed designs that cover the area of the shaft and extend down to the foot region (vamp), suggesting intricate detailing typical of stylized cowboy boots.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boot shown in Image B has a distinct heel block, elevating the rear, which is consistent with the typical structure of cowboy boots. This heel block is visible as a separate, elevated portion under the back section of the boot.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the surface of the boot exhibit visible texture resembling leather grain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, there is a visible texture on the boot's surface that resembles leather grain. This conclusion is drawn from the uneven, grainy appearance typical of authentic leather, which contributes to the aesthetic of a vintage or rugged boot appearance.",
