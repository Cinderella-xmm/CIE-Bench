      "question": "Is the pointed conical hat with a wide brim present on the gnome’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gnome clearly wears a pointed hat with a wide brim, which is visually prominent and classically associated with garden gnomes. The conical shape and brim are standard for such hats, confirming its presence. When comparing with Image A, the hat is present in both images, as expected due to the consistency of the gnome's appearance.",

      "question": "Does the gnome have a full, vertically striated beard extending from the chin down to the chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gnome features a full beard, which is textured in a vertically striated manner, extending from the chin down to the chest area. This is a typical characteristic of a garden gnome's appearance, giving it a rustic look. When comparing with Image A, the beard is present with similar characteristics in both images.",

      "question": "Is the gnome in a seated position with bent knees and a forward-facing upper body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gnome is depicted in a seated position. The visual posture shows bent knees, which is common for a seated figure, and the upper body is orientated in a forward-facing direction. This is consistent with the design of gnome statues, which often depict them in relaxed, seated postures. Comparison with Image A confirms that the posture in both images is consistent.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gnome's facial features include small, oval-shaped eyes, a broad nose, and a subtle closed smile. These traits are typical of playful gnome depictions, indicative of a whimsical character. When analyzed with Image A, these facial details match, affirming their presence in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the gnome’s feet shaped like round boots with visible stitching details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gnome's feet, while rounded and boot-like in shape, do not exhibit visible stitching details. The design is more simplistic and lacks detailed stitching. Comparing with Image A, the design of the feet remains consistent, confirming the absence of stitching detail.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire gnome is colored in a warm, sandy beige tone that is consistent throughout, providing a uniform look. The texture variations, like the striated beard, add depth to the figure. Image A corroborates this observation, showing the same uniform coloration and textural details.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both of the gnome's hands are depicted near the lower body, with neither hand raised. The hands appear to provide support or carry objects like flowers. This posture remains consistent when compared to Image A, where the positioning is identical, therefore, neither hand is raised.",
