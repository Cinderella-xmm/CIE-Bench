      "question": "Does the mirror retain its rectangular shape with illuminated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror retains its rectangular shape, which is evident from its straight, parallel edges forming right angles. The illumination around the edges is visible as a light or glow surrounding the rectangle. These visual cues indicate the retention of both the rectangular shape and the illuminated edges. By combining common sense understanding of mirror designs that often feature linear, geometric forms with backlighting or edge-lit features, it is reasonable to conclude that the mirror in Image B retains its original form.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bowl-style vessel sink can be identified by its distinct round, elevated shape sitting on the countertop, which is common for vessel sinks that are designed to sit above the counter surface.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the matte black towel rack can be seen attached to the wall on the left side of the vanity area. Its position is consistent with typical towel rack placements in bathrooms, which are often situated near sinks for convenience. The dark color and the right-angle arms suggest a matte black material. By using common knowledge of bathroom fixtures and the visibility of these features in the image, it confirms the presence of the towel rack.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the decorative arrangement includes a vase with visible branches and a small bottle on the countertop. Vases with branches are common as minimalist decor, often adding height and organic shapes to a space, while small bottles often contain toiletries like soap or lotion. The continued presence of these items on the countertop in Image B confirms the arrangement remains unchanged.",

      "choices": [

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vanity unit is positioned below the mirror. It consists of a white base and a natural wood countertop, recognizable by their distinct color and texture combination. White bases and wood counters are typical in modern bathroom designs for their clean and natural aesthetic. From these visual indicators, it can be confirmed that the vanity unit in Image B maintains the same design and positioning.",
