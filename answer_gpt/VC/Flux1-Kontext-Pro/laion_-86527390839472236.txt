    "Question": "Q1: Are the original seam lines (including those around the front pocket and vertical panel divisions) preserved as embossed linear patterns on the transformed glass vessel?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed glass vessel does not visibly retain any seam lines or embossed patterns derived from the original fabric seams of a suitcase seen in Image A. Suitcases typically have fabric seams and stitching, but the glass bottle in Image B has a smooth surface, except for the one marked line design feature. This indicates that it does not preserve any original seam lines as embossed patterns.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the brand logo positioned near the top center of the front face of the transformed object?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the brand logo is seen near the top of the glass vessel's front face, positioned in the center area. This is similar to the placement of the logo at the top center on the front face of the suitcase in Image A. This arrangement suggests the retention of the logo’s position on a transformed version.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the metallic spray nozzle located at the top center of the object, aligned vertically with the original handle’s position?",
    "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the metallic spray nozzle is situated at the top center of the transformed glass bottle. In Image A, the original suitcase handle is positioned on the top. Given the transformation, the spray nozzle's placement at the bottle’s top center aligns vertically with where the suitcase handle would be on the real suitcase.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are four decorative caps present at the base corners of the transformed object, corresponding to the original wheel positions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass vessel has four decorative caps at its corners, resembling wheels seen on the base corners of a suitcase in Image A. These caps mimic the original wheel placement, indicating a design choice to reflect the suitcase's features.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the two zipper tracks of the front pocket preserved as linear features on the transformed object, maintaining their parallel alignment and position within the front panel?",
    "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the front face of the glass vessel does not show any zipper tracks from a suitcase pocket. In Image A, zipper tracks run parallel on the front of the suitcase. The absence of similar linear features suggests that the zipper tracks were not preserved in the transformation.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is a handle present on the right side of the transformed object, corresponding to the original side handle’s position?",
    "explanation": "Image B of the transformed glass bottle shows no handle on the right side, whereas Image A depicts the suitcase with a handle on its right side. This lack of a side handle in Image B suggests that the design does not translate the suitcase’s features precisely in terms of the side handle’s presence.",
    "answer": "No"
