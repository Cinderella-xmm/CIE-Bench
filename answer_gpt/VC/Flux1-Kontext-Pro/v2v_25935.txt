    "Question": "Q1: Is the man depicted walking away from the viewer along the street?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character is a LEGO figure, identified by its distinctive yellow skin and block-like structure. The figure is moving forward with its back facing the viewer, as indicated by the back-facing cap and denim jacket, suggesting it is moving away. This is analogous to Image A where a man, presumably the original, was walking away. Both indicate the subject is moving away from the viewer.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the man still hold a briefcase in his right hand?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO figure is holding a briefcase in its right hand, portrayed as a brown accessory, which is typical for such figures as they cannot depict detailed hand grips but commonly hold accessories. Image A shows a man carrying a leather briefcase in the same manner. The important element here is the continuity of the briefcase being held in the right hand, which is consistent between the two images.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Is the man wearing a denim jacket?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the LEGO figure in an outfit that resembles a denim jacket, recognizable by the blue color and seam detailing, consistent with the garment style. In Image A, the man is identified wearing a blue denim jacket. Both images maintain the theme of the denim jacket through color and design cues.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the street depicted with a cobblestone path and buildings on both sides?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the pathway appears as a uniformly textured surface, representing the typical appearance of cobblestones when depicted in simplified model form, consistent with LEGO materials. The presence of buildings on both sides is maintained structurally in both images, with similar alignment and placement suggesting the street environment. Image A showed a real cobblestone street, which in Image B is represented in a stylized, simplified way.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the buildings on either side of the street still present with their general shapes intact?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the architecture is retained with clear outlines that suggest the continuation of the buildings along the street with a very similar structure but in a stylized portrayal typical of manufactured LEGO settings. Comparing with Image A, where more realistic buildings were shown, the general shapes and organization are retained in the edited model setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
