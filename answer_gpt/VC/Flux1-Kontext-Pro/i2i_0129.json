      "question": "Does the surfer maintain his original balancing posture on the manta ray?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfer is standing with bent knees and an outstretched arm, balancing on a large marine animal that resembles a shark rather than a manta ray. Analyzing the original Image A, the surfer is on a surfboard in a similar stance. Although it's not a manta ray but a shark that replaces the surfboard, the basic stance of the surfer is maintained, suggesting balance adjustment for surfing. Thus, this posture similarity indicates that the balancing posture is maintained.",

      "question": "Is the original wave formation preserved, with the surfer riding on top of it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wave is still present as in Image A, and it is evident that the surfer now stands atop a shark instead of a surfboard while retaining some elevation in alignment with the wave. Analyzing the wave appearance in Image A, the wave structure with the crest remains consistent between both images. The significant aspect here is the original wave's presence which indeed matches, asserting that the formation the surfer rides on is unchanged.",

      "question": "Are the ocean waters around the wave consistent with their appearance in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The waters in Image B appear with similar texture, color, and consistency as they do in Image A. This suggests no obvious alterations were made to the water aside from the addition of the shark. The ocean waters around the wave, characterized by subtle ripples and reflections typical of calm marine water, appear consistent upon comparison.",

      "question": "Is the horizon line and clear sky from the original image retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a clear sky is visible above the surfer with the same uninterrupted horizon line apparent in Image A. The sky retains its unobstructed and uniform blue tone with no signs of editing or alteration aside from the introduction of the shark. This intact appearance suggests that both the horizon line and clear sky are preserved as they are consistently visible across both images.",

      "question": "Does the surfer still wear black swim shorts and remain shirtless as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfer is observed wearing black swim shorts, identical to those in Image A. His upper body remains bare, consistent with his appearance in the original image. This observation confirms that the surfer's attire and lack thereof on the upper body remain unchanged, affirming that the clothing and shirtless state are preserved consistently.",
