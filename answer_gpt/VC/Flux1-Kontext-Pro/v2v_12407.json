    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the mango depicted with an oval shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango appears to have an elongated shape that aligns with the typical characteristics of an oval object. The top and bottom are rounded, with the middle slightly broader.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a small stem visible at the top of the mango?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, there seems to be a small dark pixel at the top of the mango, which likely represents a stem, as is common on the top of many mangoes.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the paper towel folded into a cradle-like shape beneath the mango?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the paper towel is shown surrounding the base of the mango in a manner that supports it, giving an impression of it being cradled. This type of folding serves the purpose of holding the object securely.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there four clearly defined flaps extending from the paper towel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual elements suggest that there are multiple segments of the paper towel protruding around the mango. The pixelated style makes the definition of the flaps less clear, but given the usual folding style, it is reasonable to interpret this as having multiple flaps.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the mango positioned in the center of the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the position of the mango along with the shadow and the placing of other objects suggests a central positioning relative to the visible part of the table, as is usually done for such compositions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the table show a horizontal wood grain pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the table as having a line pattern running horizontally across its surface, resembling the horizontal grain pattern common in woodwork.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is a wooden chair partially visible behind the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a partially visible object at the top right corner appears to be the backrest of a chair. The color and styling suggest it is wooden, commonly matching the aesthetic of wooden tables.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is there a diagonal shadow cast by the mango onto the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A shadow is visibly projected diagonally from the direction of the mango onto the table in Image B. This shadow alignment is consistent with a light source cast at an angle, a typical occurrence in such setups.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
