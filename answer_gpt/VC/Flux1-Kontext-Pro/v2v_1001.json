      "question": "Is the dinosaur depicted with its long neck extended and standing in the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dinosaur is not visible. Instead, the focus is on the lettering 'The King of Flavors' and a bottle standing in the water. Based on common sense, if an object was replaced by text and another object, the original feature is no longer present. Therefore, the dinosaur in Image A has been replaced in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the background still show a misty forest with tall trees?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the background continues to display a forest scene with trees and mist. The tall trees are still present, as is the hazy atmosphere indicating mist, similar to Image A's forest setting.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the water surface still reflective, showing the dinosaur and trees faintly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the dinosaur is absent, the water surface continues to show reflections, this time reflecting the new elements like the bottle and surrounding environment. Without the dinosaur, reflections would involve other elements or objects present in the frame.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is consistent with the soft haze seen in Image A, contributing to a natural and misty ambiance typical of foggy forest scenes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Reviewing Image B, the dinosaur is missing, replaced by a bottle with text. As the dinosaur is not present, its skin features cannot be retained in the current image.",
