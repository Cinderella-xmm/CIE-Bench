      "question": "Is the brown horse with bridle and harness present in the same position and configuration as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, there is no brown horse visible. Instead, the image showcases two chibi figurines dressed in traditional Chinese attire with intricate patterns in a formal portrait setting. The original Image A features a brown horse positioned to the left, harnessed for pulling a carriage. The change in subject and theme in the edited image signifies that the horse is not present.",

      "question": "Are the gilded carvings and red velvet curtains of the carriage preserved in their original form and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no gilded carvings or red velvet curtains. The new image focuses on the chibi figurines with floral and traditional decorations in an orange and gold color scheme consistent with Chinese cultural motifs, differing entirely from the European carriage style of Image A.",

      "question": "Is the coachman seated on the driverâ€™s seat with his hands on the reins as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict any coachman or carriage driver. Instead, it shows two stationary and ornamental chibi figures. The coachman is a feature specific to Image A, where a man is seated with reins, indicating a completely different setting compared to the subject in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The attendant seen in Image A does not appear in Image B, which instead highlights two chibi figures with a contrasting cultural and stylistic focus. Image B transforms the initial scene into a completely new cultural context without an attendant near a horse.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks any wheels or carriage features. The focus is on the ornate display of two chibi figures set against a decorative backdrop. Image A depicted a carriage with distinctive wooden wheels, which are not included in the edited image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a solid-colored backdrop with Asian-inspired decorations, entirely different from the landscape imagery of trees and sky present in Image A. The transition from a scenic landscape to an ornamental setting indicates that the elements are indeed not preserved.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits chibi figures with ornate gold detailing and vibrant red attire that draw inspiration from traditional Asian design. However, these elements do not directly preserve the specific design patterns of gold leaf and velvet curtains from Image A's carriage as the thematic approach is shifted.",
