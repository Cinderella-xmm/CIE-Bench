        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine includes large ears and a prominent trunk, which are characteristic features of an elephant's silhouette.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine is shown with an overall monochromatic grey color without differentiation in the ear tone, unlike a real elephant which might have a grey body with brownish ear tones. Therefore, the figurine does not maintain a separate brown ear tone and the grey body color.",
