      "question": "Does the illustration retain the man's original face shape and glasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the manâ€™s general body shape and attire are depicted cartoonishly, with vibrant lines and swooping dynamic motions surrounding him. His face shape and glasses, however, are obscured due to the editing. Since the question refers indirectly to the face shape and glasses, without needing detailed visibility, they were not verifiable. In such circumstances, the answer relies on assessing whether any suggestion of facial features is depicted, but in this scenario, there are none clear enough to evaluate accurately.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the pattern on the tie retained in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tie appears to have a similar patterned texture as in Image A, which seems consistent with real-world applications of carrying over details in creative transformations. The illustration captures this aspect accurately, suggesting a retention of detail.",

      "question": "Is the checkered pattern on the suit jacket retained in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration does not clearly depict a checkered pattern on the suit jacket. Instead, the jacket is represented more as a plain suit without visible checkered details, which aligns with the often abstract nature of illustrations where some minute details might become simplified or change in style.",

      "question": "Is the striped dress shirt visible and consistent beneath the suit in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a striped dress shirt underneath the suit, aligning with the dress shirt depicted in Image A. The stripes remain visibly consistent beneath the suit, indicating that this detail was retained and emphasized within the illustration.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the specific hairstyle details are less explicitly visible due to the blur or abstraction in the illustration, the overall silhouette of the short-cropped hairstyle seems to mirror the original style depicted in Image A, implying a retention of this characteristic.",
