    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the elderly woman’s facial expression, including the gentle smile and visible wrinkles around the eyes and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the face is deliberately blurred, so it cannot be determined whether the facial expression, including any smile or wrinkles, is retained. This prevents any visual confirmation of those details.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the elderly woman's hair appears to be short, white, and neatly styled, consistent with a typical style that suggests careful grooming. The editing maintains the overall shape and style of the hair.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Similar to the facial details, the glasses are obscured by the blurring effect in the edited image. Hence, it's not possible to confirm their presence or correct positioning.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
