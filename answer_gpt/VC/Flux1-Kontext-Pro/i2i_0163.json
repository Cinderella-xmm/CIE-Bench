      "question": "Are the toasters still rectangular with a smooth metallic finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toasters appear rectangular, characterized by their boxy shapes and defined edges. This shape is common for toasters, aiding even toasting and efficient space usage. The surface of the toasters showcases a metallic sheen, indicating a smooth metallic finish. Metallic finishes generally have reflective properties, providing the shiny appearance observed in the toasters. Their design and finish contribute both functionally and aesthetically, reflecting a modern kitchen appliance style.",

      "question": "Is the bread still rising slightly above the toaster slots with visible toast marks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the slices of bread protrude slightly above the toaster slots, which is typical for bread in a toaster as it needs to be easily removable. Toast marks, which are darker areas on the bread indicating browning, are visible, suggesting that the bread has undergone toasting. These visual cues confirm a standard degree of toasting which produces the typical browning or charring marks on the bread's surface.",

      "question": "Are the black control knobs and levers still present on the toasters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toasters have protruding black elements, which appear to be control knobs and levers typical for adjusting settings and activating the toasting function. Such controls are generally black on metallic toasters for contrast and ease of visibility. These features are integral to the appliance's usability, allowing users to adjust timing and settings for desired toast levels.",

      "question": "Do the toasters retain their reflective metallic sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the toasters in Image B displays a shiny, reflective quality characteristic of a metallic sheen. This sheen typically arises from the stainless steel or chrome material often used in toasters, contributing to their modern aesthetic and functionality by providing an easy-to-clean surface.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toasters are positioned adjacently, maintaining a parallel orientation on a tabletop. This side-by-side arrangement is logical for dual appliances used collectively, ensuring convenience and accessibility. They occupy a shared surface, a common setup in kitchen environments to conserve space and maintain orderly counters.",
