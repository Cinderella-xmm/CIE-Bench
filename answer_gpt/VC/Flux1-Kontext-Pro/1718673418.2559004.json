    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the elevated rocky outcrop forming the base of the island still present with its original silhouette and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elevated rocky outcrop at the base of the island is not the same as Image A. The new design features a large tree seemingly integrated with the houses, suggesting a transformation from a rocky outcrop to a more tree-dominated hill. Therefore, the original silhouette and position are not maintained.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the houses arranged in a dense, tiered cluster ascending the slope of the island?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the houses are visually arranged in a dense, tiered manner as they ascend along the base of what is now a large tree structure, indicating a cluster that ascends upwards. This is similar to the arrangement in Image A, despite the transformation of the island's base.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a visible road that connects the dock to the main cluster of houses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible road clearly connecting a dock to the main cluster of houses, unlike Image A where the road is apparent. The integration of bridges and water elements alters the layout apparent in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a wooden dock structure extending from the island into the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden dock structure extending from the island into the water, seen in Image A, is replaced by bridges and a small platform with a boat. The visual design does not include a dock similar to that in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {

      "question": "Are there trees visible in the foreground on both the left and right sides of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no prominent trees visible in the foreground on both the left and right sides, as the focus shifts to the central tree and landscape. This contrasts with Image A where trees frame both sides.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there large mountain peaks visible in the background behind the island?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B feature large mountain peaks in the background, framing the island. The mountain peaks serve as a consistent scenic backdrop in both images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting suggests that sunlight comes from the upper left as indicated by the consistent shadow orientation towards the lower right, mirroring the lighting conditions in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings feature red-tiled roofs and wooden walls with earthy tones, consistent with Image A. The color scheme of the buildings remains unchanged, maintaining the rustic aesthetic.",
