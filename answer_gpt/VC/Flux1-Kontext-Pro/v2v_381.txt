    "Question": "Q1: Do the nesting dolls maintain a triangular shape inspired by the pyramid?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a set of nesting dolls that have a rounded shape typical of traditional nesting dolls. This contrasts with the triangular shape of the pyramid depicted in Image A. The design of nesting dolls typically involves a cylindrical or rounded form, rather than a triangular one, which is apparent in the visual cues from Image B.",

    "Question": "Q2: Do the nesting dolls retain the stone texture seen in the original pyramid?",
    "explanation": "The pyramid in Image A has a stone texture, characterized by visible blocks and a rough, natural surface. In Image B, the nesting dolls have a smooth, painted surface with decorative floral elements. The stone-like texture is not evident in the dolls, indicating a difference in material and texture from the pyramid.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are the nesting dolls designed with a symmetrical structure similar to the original pyramid?",
    "explanation": "Image A shows a symmetrical pyramid with mirror-image sides and a triangular form. In Image B, the nesting dolls have a symmetrical cylindrical shape, typical of nesting dolls where each individual doll is symmetrical about its vertical axis. Therefore, while both can be considered symmetrical in different ways, their structural symmetry varies due to shape differences.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the nesting dolls arranged in descending size order on the wooden table?",
    "explanation": "The visual arrangement of the nesting dolls in Image B shows a descending order of size from left to right and back to front. This is typical of display setups for nesting dolls, where the largest is positioned first, progressively reducing in size. Such an arrangement is clear in the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
