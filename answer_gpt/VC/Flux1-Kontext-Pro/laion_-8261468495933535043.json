    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the two elongated sausage-shaped forms positioned on the left side of the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sausages are clearly positioned on the left side of the arrangement. Using common sense and observation of how meals are typically organized, sausages are often placed together on one side of a plate, and their elongated form makes it easy to identify them as such. Thus, this arrangement confirms that the sausages are on the left side.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a circular form with a central orange-yellow disc representing the egg yolk located in the lower right quadrant of the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's a fried egg with a bright orange-yellow yolk located in the lower right portion of the arrangement. Typically, a fried egg consists of a circular white with a central yolk, often appearing bright orange or yellow when cooked. This matches the description and confirms its location.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a cluster of green and red elements in the upper right portion of the plate representing the salad?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a collection of green leafy vegetables and small red circular items, likely cherry tomatoes, on the upper right of the arrangement. Salads customarily include such ingredients, helping identify them as salad elements placed in this position. Therefore, the placement of these elements confirms the presence of a salad in that part of the arrangement.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the meal arranged on a circular gray plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a mosaic tile-like design instead of a traditional plate. This mosaic pattern mimics a placemat or tile table which is not circular or solid gray. Therefore, the arrangement does not involve a circular gray plate.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sausages on the left, the egg in the lower right, and the salad in the upper right of the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sausages (left), egg (lower right), and salad (upper right) are placed accordingly within the mosaic tile framework. The arrangement of food items follows a common serving layout, assisting in identifying their positions distinctly within this framework.",
      "weight": 2,

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there distinct red circular elements interspersed among the green elements in the salad cluster?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the salad contains a few red circular shapes amid the green leaves, resembling common salad components such as cherry tomatoes. Observing salads often involves looking for complementary colors like red and green, confirming these elements within the salad.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there thin green linear elements (rosemary) placed along the sausages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows green sprigs placed on the sausages, resembling rosemary, which is commonly used as a garnish due to its distinctive linear and pointy shape. This representation of rosemary is quite evident upon observing the sausages.",
