      "question": "Do both players retain identifiable clothing (white shirts and shorts, white tank top with black bottoms) and hairstyles in the chibi version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi version, the players are illustrated with specific clothing details: one player is wearing a white shirt and shorts, while the other is in a white tank top with black bottoms, consistent with the clothing styles depicted in traditional tennis attire and in Image A. The hairstyles in Image B also suggest ponytails, commonly seen in tennis and align with Image A. By drawing on the visual cues and common tennis attire knowledge, we can deduce that the chibi version retains identifiable clothing and hairstyle elements.",

      "question": "Are both players still holding tennis rackets in the chibi rendition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both characters are depicted with tennis rackets in their hands, a detail evident from their stance and the visible rackets. Based on the visual elements and understanding of tennis matches where players hold rackets, it is clear they continue to hold tennis rackets in the chibi version.",

      "question": "Is the handshake pose still maintained between the two chibi players over the net?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two chibi characters are depicted shaking hands in a central scene with clasped hands visible, suggesting a maintained handshake pose. This aligns with the standard sportsmanship gesture often depicted in sports illustrations. Therefore, based on visual confirmation and understanding of the context, the handshake pose is indeed maintained in the chibi version.",

      "question": "Are tennis balls and the net still present in the foreground and middle ground respectively?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi representation does not depict specific tennis balls in the foreground or the net structure explicitly in the middle ground as seen in Image A. The emphasis in the chibi version is on the characters and a symbolic background rather than detailed foreground objects. Thus, there are no tennis balls or traditional net structures present in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the background still depict an outdoor tennis court or at least retain visual hints of it (e.g., court lines, fencing)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration opts for a stylized representation of a tennis court with a circular green background featuring some simplified court lines instead of a detailed depiction. There are no clear visuals of fences or full court views as observed in Image A. This aligns with the concept of a chibi rendition which uses minimalistic cues for setting depiction, indicating only hints of a tennis court rather than detailed portrayals.",
