    "explanation": "Upon examining the cover in Image B, the cover features elaborate carvings which include dragon depictions. With knowledge of typical designs, these are likely placed in quadrants. However, visually verifying without detailed close-up confirmation is difficult on smaller resolution images. World knowledge about quadrant designs suggests this is a favored layout for symmetry and balance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the dragons arranged symmetrically around the central compass, with each facing toward the center?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts dragons positioned around the centrally-placed compass. Given their placement in a symmetrical pattern across different quadrants, they appear to be oriented towards a central focal point, coinciding with the compass's symmetry; a common stylistic choice to enhance harmony and completeness in design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the dragons separated by cross-shaped lines dividing the cover into four equal quadrants?",
    "explanation": "The photograph displays lines meeting centrally on the cover, resembling a cross. In alignment with traditional quadrant divisions, these lines effectively create structured separations among the carved dragon depictions, allowing each dragon to inhabit its quadrant.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q7: Do the dragons have coiled bodies with raised heads and extended claws, consistent with traditional Chinese dragon depictions?",
    "explanation": "Evaluating the dragons in Image B, they appear to exhibit features typical of Chinese dragons, such as sinuous, coiled bodies, and dynamic, lifelike postures including raised heads and claws. Despite the image's scale limiting detail resolution, the consistent depiction across known cultural iconography supports this characteristic conclusion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
