      "question": "Does the image retain the brown and white pattern characteristic of a giraffe on the nesting dolls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are covered with a pattern that resembles the characteristic brown and white spotted pattern seen on a giraffe's coat. This is identifiable due to the irregular, geometric shapes filled with brown patches outlined by white lines, which mimic the coat of a giraffe.",

      "question": "Are the ossicones visible on the heads of the nesting dolls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The term 'ossicones' refers to the horn-like structures on a giraffe's head. In Image B, the tops of the nesting dolls do not feature any horn-like projections that would resemble ossicones. Therefore, they are not present on the nesting dolls.",

      "question": "Do the nesting dolls have elongated necks resembling those of giraffes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Elongated necks are a distinctive feature of giraffes. In Image B, the nesting dolls do not have elongated necks; their shape is consistent with that of typical nesting dolls, which are usually more rounded and do not feature distinct neck separations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are arranged linearly from left to right, with the tallest on the left and the smallest on the right. This configuration clearly shows a sequence of descending sizes, which is typical for nesting dolls.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Giraffes are known for their long legs, but in Image B, the nesting dolls do not have any legs at all; they are short and round, typical for nesting dolls. The design does not incorporate any features that resemble the long legs of a giraffe.",
