    "Question": "Q1: Are the individual flower petals shaped like elongated, recurved lily petals with six distinct segments per bloom?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the individual flower petals are shaped like elongated, crystalline structures but are not clearly defined as having six distinct segments per bloom as typical lily petals would. They have more of a faceted, jewel-like appearance rather than smooth, recurved shapes characteristic of lilies. Therefore, they do not fit the description of typical lily petals.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the bouquet arranged in a tightly packed, spherical cluster with multiple flowers overlapping?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bouquet is arranged in a tightly packed, spherical shape where multiple crystalline flowers appear to overlap. The petals seem to form a dense cluster, maintaining a rounded appearance typical of a spherical bouquet arrangement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a transparent, cylindrical glass vase holding the bouquet?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a vase holding the bouquet that appears to be made of transparent glass with a cylindrical shape. The transparency of the glass is evident from the ability to see through the vase to observe the water and stems inside.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the vase positioned directly beneath the bouquet, with stems/rods extending upward from it?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is positioned directly beneath the bouquet. The stems or rods extend upward from the vase into the bouquet, indicating a direct connection and support for the crystalline-like flowers.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there approximately ten to twelve flowers visible in the bouquet, including both open blooms and closed buds?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the number of visible floral structures does not clearly reach the estimate of ten to twelve flowers. Instead, it appears more like a singular crystal formation rather than identifiable as individual open blooms or closed buds that would typically be counted in a natural flower bouquet.",
    "answer": "No"
