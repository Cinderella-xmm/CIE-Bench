    "Question": "Q1: Is the elevated rocky outcrop forming the base of the island still present with its original silhouette and position?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the elevated rocky outcrop at the base of the island is not the same as Image A. The new design features a large tree seemingly integrated with the houses, suggesting a transformation from a rocky outcrop to a more tree-dominated hill. Therefore, the original silhouette and position are not maintained.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the houses arranged in a dense, tiered cluster ascending the slope of the island?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the houses are visually arranged in a dense, tiered manner as they ascend along the base of what is now a large tree structure, indicating a cluster that ascends upwards. This is similar to the arrangement in Image A, despite the transformation of the island's base.",
