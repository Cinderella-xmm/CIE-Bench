      "question": "Are the windows aligned vertically in the same columns across all floors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each floor of the building showcases windows aligned directly above each other, creating a uniform vertical column arrangement. The building's architectural design in terms of window placement contributes to this alignment and symmetry, which is commonly seen in multi-story residential buildings. Therefore, based solely on Image B, the conclusion is that the windows are aligned vertically across all floors.",

      "question": "Is there a red door located on the left side of the ground floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals the presence of a red door located at the forefront of the building's left side on the ground floor. This is distinguished from other doors by color and position. Typically, such doors are used as one of the various entrances to individual units within multi-unit structures. Thus, based on this observation, there is confirmation of a red door on the left side of the ground floor.",

      "question": "Is there a dark-colored door located on the right side of the ground floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, several dark-colored doors can be seen along the building's ground floor, particularly at the far right. These provide entry access to various segments of the structure, a common feature in multi-residential buildings. Combining this visual analysis confirms that there is a dark-colored door on the right side of the ground floor.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the climbing plant cover the central vertical strip of the building, spanning from near the ground floor up to the third floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any vegetation, such as climbing plants, on the building. The entire facade appears uniformly maintained without any visible flora, which implies either seasonal changes or intentional landscaping choices. Thus, there is no evidence of climbing plants spanning the vertical strip of the building from the ground floor to the third floor.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a red rectangular outline enclosing a section of the building that includes three stacked windows and a balcony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains no visible red outlines or markings that section off parts of the building. Typically, such outlines might be used to highlight or focus on particular architectural features, but in this case, the building facade is uniform without additional highlighting. Therefore, based solely on Image B, there is no red rectangular outline enclosing any section of the building.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the balconies located directly outside specific windows on the second, third, and fourth floors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, balconies appear to be placed directly outside of specific windows across the second, third, and fourth floors. Architecturally, this arrangement provides residents direct access from their units to outdoor space, a common design feature. Thus, interpreting Image B without cross-reference to Image A confirms balconies are located directly outside specific windows on those floors.",
