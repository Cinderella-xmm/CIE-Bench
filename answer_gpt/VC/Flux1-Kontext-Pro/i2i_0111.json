      "question": "Does the edited image retain the swirling vortex texture in the night sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the night sky features swirling patterns typical of Van Gogh's 'Starry Night.' The swirling vortex texture, characterized by circular, flowing brushstrokes, is prominently visible, which aligns with the style of the original painting. Therefore, based on visual observation combining world knowledge of Van Gogh's style, the swirling textures are retained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the upper right corner contains a bright circular object with a crescent shape, reflecting the moon. This matches the typical portrayal in Van Gogh's 'Starry Night,' where the moon is a key feature. Hence, the crescent moon is visible in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B shows a tall, dark structure on the left side, which aligns with the usual depiction of the cypress tree in Van Gogh's 'Starry Night.' With its elongated shape and relative position unchanged, it suggests the cypress tree is preserved as in the original.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible village scene, featuring a prominent tall spire pointing to the sky, a distinct element typical of Van Gogh's painting style and the original 'Starry Night.' Their positions seemingly intact indicate retention in the edited image.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
