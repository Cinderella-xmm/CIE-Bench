      "question": "Does the image retain the golden-brown color and flaky texture of the croissants?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the appearance of the croissants maintains a golden-brown color, similar to what is recognized as the typical baked look of croissants. The texture, though depicted in a stylized illustration, suggests a flaky appearance through the visual representation. Using visual cues combined with common knowledge of croissants having a golden-brown hue and flaky surface, it can be concluded that the image retains these characteristics.",

      "question": "Does the image retain the swirl pattern of the cupcake frosting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each cupcake still displays a distinct swirl pattern in its frosting. This pattern is visually similar to what is commonly seen in real-life cupcakes where frosting is piped in a circular motion to form swirls. This indicates that the swirl pattern is retained in the stylization of the edited illustration.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cupcake frostings are visible with distinct colors: pink, blue, and a yellow-like shade. These colors mirror the hue representation seen in Image A. Recognizing these as typical bright frosting colors, it can be concluded that the image retains these colors.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the tartlet topped with what visually discern looks like red and blue berries, utilizing stereotypical coloring for berries. This observation, combined with common knowledge of berry colors, suggests a retention of the red and blue berry depiction from Image A.",

      "question": "Does the image retain the relative positions and groupings of the desserts as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, various pastries and desserts are scattered over an illustrated map, aligning along designated paths. While Image A has a more realistic placement without such distinct separations or designated paths, the essence of grouping diverse pastries together does remain intact. However, the positions have been deliberately altered to fit a map layout. This change in layout suggests the arrangement is not retained in the sense of their precise spatial positions.",
