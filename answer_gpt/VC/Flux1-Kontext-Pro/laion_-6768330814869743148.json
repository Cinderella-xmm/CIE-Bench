      "question": "Are there exactly four wooden trays arranged in a 2x2 grid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual layout reveals four distinct sections, each with what appears to be wooden textures and outlined edges. These sections are arranged in what logically appears to be a 2x2 grid pattern. This is consistent with common displays of pastries in a bakery or cafe setup where trays are organized neatly for customers. By referring to such patterns, it is reasonable to conclude the array is indeed a 2x2 grid of trays.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the madeleines retain their distinctive shell-shaped form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pastries that are labeled as 'Madeleine' have a round and somewhat bulbous shape, which contrasts the traditional shell shape typically seen in madeleines. Madeleines usually have a distinct scallop shell appearance, which these do not exhibit in their structure based on the visual cues from the image.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the label reading \"Madeleine\" positioned near the tray containing shell-shaped pastries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, even though the label 'Madeleine' is visible, it is positioned next to pastries that do not exhibit the classic shell shape as ones typically associated with madeleines. The pastries are round, which suggests the label's association is incorrect based on visual expectations for shell shapes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the word \"craster\" visibly engraved on the front of each of the four trays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) uses artistic rendering that does not provide clear enough detail to make out precise engravings such as the word 'craster.' Areas which may carry such text are obscured by the stylization, making it difficult to verify such specific detail.",
      "weight": 3,

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is parchment paper visible inside each of the four trays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a textured layer inside what is delineated as trays can be discerned. This layer has a different color and appears to be placed under the pastries, resembling parchment paper typically used in serving baked goods. Despite the heavily stylized form, this adds up to be acknowledged as parchment paper, as in customary presentations of pastries.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the pastries in the top-right tray retain their oval, slightly flattened shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the artistic stylization of Image B, the pastries in the top-right section possess circular shapes. This conflicts with the oval, slightly flattened shape of traditional pastries usually found in similar trays, indicating that the shape has not been retained.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the pastries in the bottom-left tray clearly shaped as sliced loaf bread with visible internal texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, certain rectangular objects in the bottom-left section have an appearance that could correspond to slices of loaf bread, evidenced by regular rectangular forms. However, the texture detailing looks simplified and transformed due to the art style. These shapes do indeed seem like sliced loaf bread, affirming the appearance comparison with knowledge of usual bakery items.",
