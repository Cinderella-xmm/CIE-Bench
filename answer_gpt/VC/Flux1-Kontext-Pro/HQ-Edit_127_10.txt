    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the intricate wrought-iron lattice structure of both Eiffel Towers?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe contains two miniature Eiffel Towers which visually mimic the intricate lattice structure characteristic of the real Eiffel Tower, known for its detailed ironwork. Despite the scale variation due to the snow globe setting, the towers maintain this recognized feature. Thus, the lattice detail is preserved.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are both towers supported by a triangular base composed of four distinct pillars?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, each Eiffel Tower inside the snow globe clearly displays the traditional triangular arrangement typical in its design with four distinct and observable base legs or pillars. This is consistent with the structural design seen in the real Eiffel Tower, supporting it with a solid foundation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a clearly defined archway beneath each tower through which the path passes?",
    "explanation": "The edited image within the snow globe contains a pathway where there's an open space under each tower representative of the central archway in the Eiffel Tower's design, signifying the passage that allows visitors to walk through.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there exactly two Eiffel Towers present in the scene?",
    "explanation": "Upon reviewing Image B, we see two Eiffel Towers within the snow globe. This unusual artistic representation deliberately features two towers, which distinguishes it from the real-world landscape of Paris.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does each tower have a pointed spire at its apex?",
    "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the top of each Eiffel Tower in the snow globe includes a pointed spire, a characteristic feature seen at the summit of the real Eiffel Tower. This spire gives the towers a distinct silhouette and helps identify their iconic structural design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there three distinct horizontal platform levels visible along the height of each tower?",
    "explanation": "Typically, the Eiffel Tower features three prominent platforms or levels as part of its design. In Image B, while the snow globe reduces scale and detail, it retains enough structural likeness to identify these three main levels visible along each tower.",
    "answer": "Yes"
