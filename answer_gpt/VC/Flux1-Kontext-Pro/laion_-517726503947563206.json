    {

      "question": "Is the text \"Aurora\" visible on the side of the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a thorough inspection reveals the absence of any visible text labeled 'Aurora' on the side of the ship. The ship's exterior is covered in a reflective, mirrored surface, making any text difficult to discern or potentially not present. This requires visual analysis and understanding that text might be obscured by design features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the registration number \"QV-8880\" visible on the hull of the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hull of the ship appears similarly mirrored and reflective as the rest of the ship, resulting in a lack of visible text such as a registration number. The reflective property would likely obscure any smaller, detailed text like a registration number, which would have been checked by examining the hull area visually.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is a red flag visible at the top of the ship’s mast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is a flag clearly located at the top of the ship’s mast, which is visually identifiable by its distinct red color. This recognition comes from observing the topmost part of the mast and applying the understanding of flag positioning and common national or maritime colors.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the ship oriented in a side profile view, facing toward the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the ship in a side profile orientation, with the bow directed toward the right side of the image. This observation is based on viewing the length of the ship with visible windows and details along its side and the pointed front indicating direction.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the ship depicted as floating on a body of water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship is clearly positioned on a body of water, as evidenced by the water's surface beneath it, supporting the ship visually. This conclusion is drawn from understanding the typical environment for ships and visually confirming its placement.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the ship positioned near the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the ship slightly off-center, with a noticeable portion of the image space occupied by the expanse of water and sky to the left of the ship. This positioning is recognized by evaluating spatial distribution and the image composition.",
