        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a zebra on a flat green background, unrelated to skiing or any race starting scenario. The original context of a ski race with a 'START' banner is entirely absent. There is no 'START' text visible in Image B as the scene is completely different.",

        "Yes",
        "No"

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature any human or skier, thus there is no bib with any numbers visible. The content involves a zebra, and no elements related to skiing are present.",
