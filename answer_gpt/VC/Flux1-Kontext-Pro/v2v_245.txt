    "Question": "Q1: Are the two jet engines mounted under the wings of the airplane present and correctly positioned?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the airplane shows two engines mounted under the wings, which is a common position for commercial aircraft. The visual cues indicate that the engines are cylindrical and positioned symmetrically on either side of the fuselage.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the continuous row of oval-shaped passenger windows visible along the side of the fuselage?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the airplane displays a row of oval-shaped passenger windows running along the side of the fuselage. This feature is typical for commercial aircraft, providing passengers with views and natural light.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the rounded nose cone with the three-part cockpit window configuration present at the front of the airplane?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a rounded nose cone at the front of the airplane, along with the cockpit windows divided into three segments, which is a typical configuration for modern passenger aircraft for visibility from the cockpit.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the tall vertical stabilizer (tail fin) present at the rear of the airplane?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tall vertical stabilizer, or tail fin, is clearly visible at the rear of the airplane. It is crucial for maintaining the aircraft's stability and directional control during flight.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the landing gear assemblies with multiple wheels visible beneath the fuselage and wings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the landing gear, including the wheels, is visible beneath the fuselage. Landing gear with multiple wheels is typical for commercial airplanes to support the weight of the aircraft during takeoff, landing, and ground operations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the main wing structure extending from the fuselage with engines mounted underneath?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the main wing structure of the airplane is clearly visible, extending from the fuselage with two engines mounted underneath. This structural design is characteristic of commercial aircraft to provide necessary lift and support the engines.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the three cockpit windows arranged in a horizontal line at the front of the airplane?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cockpit windows are effectively arranged in a horizontal line, which is a typical arrangement for modern commercial aircraft, allowing pilots a wide field of view for operating the aircraft safely.",
    "answer": "Yes"
