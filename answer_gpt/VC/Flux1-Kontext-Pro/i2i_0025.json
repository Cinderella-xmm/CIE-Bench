      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman appears to be sitting close to the foreground and is somewhat off-center to the right rather than centrally positioned. She is holding a glass, which is slightly lifted as if she is about to drink from it. This conclusion is drawn from observing her posture and position relative to the rest of the setting in the image.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman in Image B is holding a wine glass. The shape and positioning of the glass suggest it contains a liquid, which is corroborated by the standard features of a typical wine glass. This analysis depends on recognizing familiar shapes and their common function.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible papers on the table in front of the woman. These papers are distinct due to their white color contrasting with the wooden table and seem to be forms or notes. The observation is based on the typical depiction of papers indicated by their rectangular shape.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an indoor environment, evident from the visible tables, chairs, and the presence of walls and a roof. The seating arrangement and furniture strongly suggest this is an indoor setting, likely a meeting or tasting session, as deduced from common indoor scenes.",
