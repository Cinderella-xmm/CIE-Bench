    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the orange circular lifebuoy still present and clearly visible in the same position near the netting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no presence of an orange circular lifebuoy near the netting. Instead, the focus of Image B has shifted to a large, cartoonish creature in the water, which occupies the space where visual attention might have been directed towards the lifebuoy. This suggests that the lifebuoy has been removed or is obscured by the presence of this creature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dark mesh netting still visible along the shoreline, connected by vertical poles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ocean and a cartoon creature dominate the scene, and there is no visible dark mesh netting as observed in Image A. The poles or netting that would typically signify such a structure are absent, indicating a significant alteration of the scene.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the shoreline maintain its original diagonal slope from the bottom left to the top right of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a complete absence of the shoreline that was prominent in Image A. The edited image features a cartoon creature surfacing in the water without any visible diagonal slope of a shoreline, signifying an alteration of the original spatial orientation captured in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the orange lifebuoy physically connected to one of the vertical poles of the netting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since the orange lifebuoy and the netting are both absent in Image B, there is no way to have a connection between them. The focal shift to a cartoon character in water suggests removal of these elements.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible white foam patterns in the water immediately adjacent to the shoreline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible white foam patterns in the water, particularly visible around the cartoon creature in the water, suggesting that wave action is still occurring. While the shoreline itself may not be depicted, the adjacent water still holds foam patterns.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the sand along the shoreline still light beige in color, without significant discoloration or tinting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible sand along the shoreline at all, indicating it has been completely obscured or removed from the frame. The focus is instead on the water and a cartoon creature, thereby the sandy area coloration cannot be evaluated.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are at least three vertical poles visible along the netting, evenly spaced from the foreground to the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a lack of any visible netting or vertical poles as seen in Image A. The scene now focuses on a cartoon creature, eliminating the original setup of poles and netting entirely.",
