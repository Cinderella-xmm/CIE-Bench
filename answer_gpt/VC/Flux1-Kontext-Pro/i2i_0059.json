        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not showcase a steak; instead, it depicts an elephant. Thus, the visual cues related to the steak, such as the charred and cooked appearance, are not present in Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include broccoli florets or any vegetables at all. It instead shows an elephant in a forest setting. Therefore, the bright green color and natural shape of broccoli are not visible in this image.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any carrot slices, as it depicts an elephant. Hence, the bright orange color and circular shape of carrot slices are absent from Image B.",
