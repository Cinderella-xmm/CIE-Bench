      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there are three women standing next to each other. Each woman is dressed in a similar burgundy gown and they are arranged in a line, which is a typical arrangement for a group of three individuals. Hence, the analysis is straightforward based on visual confirmation.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central woman in the edited image is flanked by one woman on her left and another on her right, creating a symmetrical arrangement that is typical for group portraits featuring an individual in the center.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "All three women in the edited image are holding bouquets with both hands positioned slightly in front of their bodies at waist level. This positioning is consistent across all three, indicating they are holding their bouquets in a similar manner.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The women in the edited image appear to be facing forward, indicating that they are directly facing the camera. This forward-facing orientation is typical in group portraits, particularly when they are arranged as closely together as these women are.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts all three women standing in an upright position; however, their full bodies are not visible because the image is cropped around mid-calf level. Thus, while they are upright, only a part of their bodies is visible, not the full length.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the blurred face, it is not possible from the edited image to determine the facial expression of the central woman, specifically whether she is smiling with an open mouth showing teeth. Therefore, no definitive visual judgment can be made.",
