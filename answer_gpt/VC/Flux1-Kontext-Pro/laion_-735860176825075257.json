      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each of the three sections has black-and-white half-timbered gable ends that sit at the top of each section of the building. This is a common architectural feature in Tudor-style buildings. Thus, the visual cues align with this architectural style.",
