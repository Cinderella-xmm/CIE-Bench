      "question": "Is the vase's overall shape preserved, including its three-panel body, twin scrolled handles, and flared neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the vase appears to be made of clear glass with etched patterns, and it lacks the distinct features of a three-panel body or twin scrolled handles. The design in Image B is more streamlined and simple, with no intricate or standout features that resemble a multi-panel structure or scrolled handles. In contrast, Image A shows an ornate vase with these specific elements, indicating that the vase's shape has been altered in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the bouquet extend beyond the rim of the vase, creating an overflowing effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers have a delicate, minimal arrangement, suggesting they are contained within the vase without overflowing significantly. The bouquet is composed of translucent, pastel-colored flowers, which adds to a more restrained appearance. In contrast, Image A displays a lush and abundant arrangement that appears to be overflowing the vase. Hence, Image B does not give an impression of overflowing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there scattered flowers on the surface of the pedestal, including at least one pink poppy and blue blooms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a pristine vase set on a reflective pedestal, portraying a minimalistic approach with all elements neatly contained. There are no additional flowers scattered outside the vase on the surface. In Image A, however, a more embellished scene is portrayed, with scattered flowers enhancing the overflow and informal beauty. Therefore, Image B lacks the scattered flowers present in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the vase positioned centrally on the pedestal within the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is placed squarely in the center of the pedestal and is symmetrically framed within the image. This central positioning is visually evident and adheres to aesthetic norms of symmetry and balance. In Image A, the positioning could vary but does not impact the centered and symmetrical framing observed in Image B.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do some of the flowers rest directly on the surface of the pedestal, separate from the main bouquet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement in Image B shows that all flowers are part of the vase's bouquet, with no individual flowers resting on the pedestal. The setup conveys an intentional and tidy design with no stray elements outside the main composition. This contrasts with Image A, where scattered flowers on the surface contribute to an intentional clutter effect, indicating a difference in style and presentation between the two images.",
