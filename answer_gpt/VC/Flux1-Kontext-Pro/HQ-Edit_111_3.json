      "question": "Does the butterfly retain its original iridescent electric blue wing color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is displayed in the central part with wings reflecting an electric blue color. The term 'iridescent' suggests a vibrant, shimmering effect typical of many butterflies. This color stands out distinctly, making it reasonable to conclude this attribute is retained based on visual cues and common knowledge about butterfly wings.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a depiction of a bright pink flower beneath the butterfly, which suggests it could be a cosmos flower characteristic of colorful garden scenes. This flower is prominently featured and serves as an element of the educational diagram.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a symbolic approach where the butterfly is visually hovering above or in relation to the flower without physical contact, aligning with educational illustrations that often depict objects in proximity rather than direct contact.",
