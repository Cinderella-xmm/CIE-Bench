      "question": "Is the butterfly still positioned centrally in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is visually prominent and centrally located in the image, drawing attention as the main subject. This central positioning maintains its importance and balance within the composition, making it appear as the focal point of the scene. Common photographic principles suggest centering the main subject to create a strong visual impact.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the butterfly retain its blue color theme, even if reinterpreted as energy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is enveloped in a vivid blue aura or energy that enhances its blue color theme. The wings of the butterfly have a strong blue hue, amplified by the surrounding blue energy. This energy reinterpretation maintains the butterfly's blue theme, signifying vibrancy and focus in the image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the dark silhouette below the butterfly retain its general rugged shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area below the butterfly is depicted as a rocky, rugged terrain with jagged edges and a cracked surface. This creates an impression of a natural, uneven landscape, similar to a silhouette with a rugged form. By analyzing the visual texture and comparing it to typical silhouettes, the image conveys a comparable ruggedness, indicating retention of its general shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the butterfly still depicted as hovering above the dark silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is positioned above the rocky, shadowy landscape that resembles a silhouette. The vertical separation between the butterfly and the terrain beneath suggests the butterfly is hovering or flying over it. This placement continues the theme of the butterfly's interaction with the silhouette but from an elevated position.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the dark silhouette below the butterfly retain its dark color contrast with the butterfly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly, with its vibrant blue coloring and energetic emanations, stands out against the dark, almost black color of the terrain below. This stark contrast enhances the visual prominence of the butterfly by playing against the deep, shadowy hues of the silhouette, maintaining a similar contrasting theme.",
