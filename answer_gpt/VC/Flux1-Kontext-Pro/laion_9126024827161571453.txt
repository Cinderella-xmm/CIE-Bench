    "Question": "Q1: Are the battery tops rendered in copper color?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, three human-like characters are depicted with black armor featuring orange glowing lines, rather than typical batteries with copper tops. The design could suggest metallic elements similar to copper, but it is more stylized and abstract rather than directly comparable to a simple copper color. Without distinct battery tops in typical copper, the answer is derived from the nature of the depiction rather than direct observation. Hence the characters don't explicitly have copper tops.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the word 'DURACELL' printed vertically in white on the black body of each battery?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no batteries depicted with 'DURACELL' printed vertically. Instead, there are armor-clad characters which do not resemble typical battery designs. Since no direct visual representation of batteries as in Image A appears, the answer is grounded by the depicted context.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a silver band near the base of each battery with the word 'DURALOCK' inscribed on it?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no batteries or any visible silver bands with inscriptions like 'DURALOCK.' The image depicts futuristic characters, leaving no visual evidence of such details associated with batteries. Thus, based on absence and context interpretation in the image, the answer follows logically.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the phrase '10 Years in Storage' visibly present in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a phrase '10 Years in Storage' displayed within a sign or area highlighted to convey durability, similar to product advertisements. Observing this detail in the futuristic setting of the image confirms its presence, providing the basis for the answer.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there exactly four batteries or battery-inspired characters depicted?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are three armored characters standing in a formation suggestive of guards or sentinels. Although they are not literal 'batteries,' their stylized form could be considered battery-inspired in a theoretical sense. However, there are only three characters, not four, present in the scene.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the brand name 'DURACELL' displayed in large, bold letters at the top of the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the brand 'DURACELL' is prominently displayed at the top, followed by 'GUARDIANS'. This large bold representation of the brand name matches typical product and brand emphasis in advertising, allowing for a clear conclusion to be drawn directly from visual observation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
