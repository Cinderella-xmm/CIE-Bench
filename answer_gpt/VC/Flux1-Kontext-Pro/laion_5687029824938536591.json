      "question": "Is the triangular panel structure across the midfoot preserved in shape and spatial arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B feature a shoe with a similar midfoot design, characterized by a series of triangular panels. In Image B, these panels have the same shape and spatial arrangement, contributing to the shoe's structure. The edited image mirrors the geometric layout present in Image A, ensuring functional and aesthetic consistency.",

      "question": "Is the \"SPEEDCROSS\" text positioned along the lateral side of the shoe in the same location and orientation as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature the 'SPEEDCROSS' text on the lateral side of the shoe, whereas Image A clearly shows this detail. Upon comparing both images, Image B lacks this textual component, suggesting a deviation in design elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the Salomon logo is visible on both the heel counter and tongue tab. However, in Image B, there appears to be a creative rendering that does not include specific logos, focusing instead on a wood-like texture. This indicates the absence of the logos in their original positions.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lacing system in Image B maintains the same number and spacing of eyelets as Image A, reflecting a similar structural design. Despite the wooden aesthetic modification in Image B, the functional aspect of the lacing system remains unchanged compared to the original version.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A features a distinct lug pattern on the outsole and 'contagrip' text. In Image B, while the lug pattern is visually mimicked with a wood texture, the 'contagrip' text is notably absent, indicating a change in design details.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shape of the reinforced toe cap in Image B maintains similarity with Image A in terms of form, but the embossed 'S' logo seen on Image A's toe cap is absent in Image B, reflecting a stylistic modification.",
