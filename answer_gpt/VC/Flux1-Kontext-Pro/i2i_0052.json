      "question": "Does the image retain the natural wool texture of the sheep?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual cues such as the smooth, cartoon-like style of the characters indicate that the natural wool texture is not retained. In chibi or cartoon illustrations, realistic textures are often simplified or not present at all, focusing instead on cute and stylized designs. Therefore, the natural wool texture is not evident in the edited image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the sheep retain their darker facial and leg markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the chibi illustration does not display any sheep or their markings. Instead, it showcases human characters with simplified features typically seen in caricature art. No facial or leg markings associated with sheep are apparent in the illustration.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the grassy field setting retained, including the distribution of sheep?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is heavily altered with simplified graphics that resemble a sports context rather than a grassy field with sheep. The tennis court backdrop replaces the natural setting seen in Image A, and the distribution of sheep is not retained.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tree line marking the field's border retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not depict a tree line or a countryside field. Instead, the background presents elements associated with a tennis setting, such as simple line markers. This signifies a shift from natural geography to a stylized, indoor theme typical of cartoon depictions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sheepâ€™s natural behaviors, such as grazing or standing, retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the illustration, the cartoon character design diverges completely from natural behavior of sheep like grazing or standing. Instead, human figures are depicted engaging in a sporting activity, which does not correlate with sheep behavior.",
