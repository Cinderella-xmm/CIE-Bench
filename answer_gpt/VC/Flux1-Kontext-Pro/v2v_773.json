      "question": "Is there a single dark brown seed visible in the center of the apple's cross-section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the focal point is the visually identifiable apple seed situated centrally within the cross-section. The seed appears to be singular in number, with the visual's limited complexity reaffirming its singularity. The depth and color are consistent with classic apple seeds. Without referring to Image A, these cues alone are adequate for affirming the seed's presence.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the appleâ€™s flesh show a dry, fibrous texture with visible vein-like patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apple's flesh is visible and displays surface features that are distinguishably dry and fibrous. These characteristics, paired with the subtle vein-like or web-like patterns, suggest an altered or aged state of the apple. Such textures are typically associated with dehydration or natural aging, providing evidence to conclude affirmatively.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a dark brown stem attached to the top of the apple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals a clear presence of a stem at the apple's top, with color characteristics in the darker brown spectrum. This stem is attached naturally, indicating the apple's whole support structure at the top end. This visual evidence confirms its presence without any need for reference bailout.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the apple sliced vertically, exposing a symmetrical cross-section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The symmetry seen in Image B's apple cross-section indicates a vertical slice. Symmetry is evenly revealed in both halves, embodying a centered and properly bifurcated apple slice often achieved by vertical cutting. Hence, such symmetry validates the claims of vertical slicing.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the apple placed on a flat, light gray, matte surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A thorough examination of Image B depicts the apple resting on a surface, evidently pale and resembling light gray in coloration. The surface texture gives off a matte appearance, with no noticeable gloss or sheen; standard attributes of matte surfaces. It is flat in general structure as conveyed visually in the image.",
