      "question": "Is the dorsal ridge composed of a series of raised, looped structures running along the back of the pig?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dorsal ridge of the pig consists of raised and looped structures along its back. This is apparent from observing that there are distinct, rounded shapes that appear elevated above the pig's back surface, arranged in a line from the head to the start of the tail. This structure is consistent with the description of a 'series of raised, looped structures'.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the tail extend from the rear of the pig and terminate in a fluffy pom-pom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tail extends from the rear and ends in a rounded, fuller structure that resembles a pom-pom. This is evidenced by the shape and finish of the tail in the image, which is fuller at the end, giving the impression of a pom-pom, matching the description provided.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there four short legs attached beneath the body, two on each side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig figure clearly shows four short legs, with two visible on the near side and the implication of two on the far side due to symmetric designing. The positioning beneath the body and the typical appearance of legs in such sculptures lead to this conclusion.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a rounded snout extending forward from the face of the pig?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plastinated snout in Image B has a rounded appearance and protrudes forward from its face. This is seen from observing its shape that is typical for stylized representations of pig snouts, which are usually depicted as rounded extensions.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there two small, upright ears positioned on the top of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two upright, small ears are clearly positioned on top of the pig's head. These ears are visible near the top front region of the head in the image, fitting with the common portrayal of pigs' ears in crafts, positioned such that they align with the head's curvature.",
