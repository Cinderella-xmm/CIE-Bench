      "question": "Is the central positioning and rectangular shape of the light blue sofa retained in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a light blue sofa with a rectangular shape is centrally positioned within the room. The visual cues suggest that the sofa maintains its original shape and positioning. To validate this, we assess the identical alignment, size, and form in Image A, which confirms this constancy. Both images depict the sofa as a focal point of room composition, hence the answer is based on consistent visual evidence across both images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a framed landscape painting in a rectangular shape, centrally positioned above the sofa. Analyzing the dimensions and placement, it matches the painting seen in Image A. The consistency in size and relative location compared to the sofa corroborates the presence and alignment checked in both images.",

      "question": "Are the large green leaves of the plant on the left side of the sofa preserved in terms of shape and location?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a plant with large green leaves on the left side of the sofa, similar in form and placement to what is visible in Image A. The preservation of the plant's characteristic rectangular leaf patterns and nearby location relative to the sofa in both images indicates no significant alteration. This consistency is confirmed through visual examination in both cases.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a blue-based lamp with a white shade is set on a table to the sofa's right, maintaining its expected shape and position. Image A showcases an identical lamp setup, confirming that the object retains its distinctive traits and location in the edited version. This determination relies on visual consistency and logical placement assessment.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a light-colored rug located below the sofa. The existence and positioning of such a rug can be checked against Image A, where a similar rug presence is verifiable. The visual cues, notably the textured look beneath the sofa, suggest a minor alteration in the painterly style of Image B does not significantly affect the presence or location of the rug, maintaining a consistent element.",
