      "question": "Is the flared leg silhouette preserved in the transformed design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a perfume bottle with a curved, elegant design and no features resembling pants. The flared leg silhouette described in the question implies the appearance of pants with a wider bottom section, which would not apply to a perfume bottle. Thus, based on the shape and structure of the object in Image B, the flared leg silhouette is not present. Therefore, the answer must be 'No.'",

      "question": "Are the lace-up details present on the outer sides of the lower legs in the transformed design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a perfume bottle, and there are no visible details resembling lace-up features. Lace-up details imply clothing or fabric with interwoven ties, typically observed on garments. Since Image B is entirely different from clothing and does not display any such textile features, this characteristic is absent. Therefore, the answer is 'No.'",

      "question": "Is the denim blue color retained in the transformed design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the perfume bottle contains a liquid of a blue hue, similar to the typical color of denim. Comparatively, denim blue is a common medium to dark blue color typically associated with denim fabric, and the liquid in Image B indeed matches this description. Hence, the color consistency is maintained between the two, leading to the answer 'Yes.'",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the side profile view maintained in the transformed design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a head-on view of the front facing side of a perfume bottle, not a side profile. In product photography, a side profile would show a lateral perspective highlighting the depth or side curvature typically seen in apparel. This face-forward orientation does not convey the side profile consistent with how a garment might be displayed. Consequently, the answer is 'No.'",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the proportional length and tapering from knee to ankle preserved in the transformed design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a perfume bottle which inherently lacks any features that could be compared to the human form or clothing dimensions such as tapering from knee to ankle. There is no depiction of tapering or differences in proportional length similar to a garment fit. Thus, the qualities described in the question cannot be applied to the perfume bottle in Image B. Therefore, the answer is 'No.'",
