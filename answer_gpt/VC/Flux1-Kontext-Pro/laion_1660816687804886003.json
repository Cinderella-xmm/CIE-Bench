      "question": "Is the circular logo featuring a navy blue \"C\" shape with a red semicircle at the top present on the front of the energy drink can?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the energy drink can has a sneaker design wrapping around it. The logo in question is on the side of the can that initially appears to be similar to a logo typically found on sneakers. By using common sense, logos with distinct shapes are added to branded products as identifying features. This circular logo indeed features the described shapes and colors, hence confirming its presence on the can.",

      "question": "Does the energy drink can feature the navy blue mesh texture across its main body surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On observing Image B, the drink can clearly exhibits a textured surface that mimics the mesh pattern found on sneakers. This distinctive texture covers a significant portion of the can's body, which is similar to the texture found on athletic shoes. Therefore, the navy blue mesh texture is present on the can.",

      "question": "Are the navy blue laces depicted as raised embossed ridges wrapping around the middle section of the can in their original crisscross pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows navy blue laces on the can, depicted as raised ridges that follow the original crisscross pattern commonly observed on sneakers. The depiction maintains the familiar arrangement of laces wrapping around the shoe, translated onto the can's surface, illustrating the pattern effectively.",

      "question": "Are three navy blue stripes arranged horizontally across the lower portion of the can, matching the original shoe's stripe layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When analyzing Image B, three navy blue stripes are visible on the lower portion of the can, running horizontally. This arrangement does not match the original vertical stripe layout seen in Image A where the stripes are on the shoe's side. The stripes in Image B deviate from the original, as they appear aligned differently.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the energy drink can prominently displays the word 'Kickstart' in bold red letters at the top or upper portion of the can. This style of typographic branding on cans is common for emphasizing the product's name and appeal, making it visually distinct.",
