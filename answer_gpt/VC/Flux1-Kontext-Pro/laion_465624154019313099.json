    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the grid of yellow rounded domes covering the surface of the cake present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual clues in the edited image, the main character in the comic strip has yellow rounded domes, which appear to be similar to the cake's surface in Image A. The character is likely a caricature of the cake itself. The domes are clearly indicated as frosting details along its top surface. Common sense and the context of the comic's theme suggest that the character represents the cake and its domed design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there small red dots on top of each yellow dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the main character has a strawberry hat, and additional strawberries with faces appear, but there are no indications of small red dots on their surfaces. This likely hints that each dome does not have a red dot like the cake in Image A; rather, the strawberries represent the sporadic red accents.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cross-section showing a golden sponge base, white cream layer, and deep red jam layer visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the visual representation centers around a cartoon character inspired by the cake. The fact that the comic character does not display detailed cross-section layers implies that there is no representation of the intricate layers visible in the cross-section similar to Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are two strawberries with green leaves positioned at the top center of the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the edited image, strawberries are essential characters. Their prominent depiction within the comic indicates their symbolic importance. However, they are not positioned at the top center akin to the cake in Image A; instead, they are dynamically interacting within the comic's scenes.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are chopped nuts visible around the base of the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image is focused on a comic strip where the cake's design elements have been transformed into cartoonish attributes rather than maintaining real-world decorations. Thus, chopped nuts around the base are not represented in this artistic interpretation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the cake maintain a square shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the edited image, it depicts a cartoon character which does not retain the square shape of the original cake. Instead, the character takes a rounded, amorphous form, indicating that its shape deviates from the classic square structure.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the cake placed on a silver-toned plate with an embossed floral pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the focus is shifted to the comic's narrative, with no emphasis on the cake's placement or the specifics of a plate pattern. The comic does not replicate the cake's real serving details as seen in the actual photograph.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the deep red jam layer clearly visible between the white cream and golden sponge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the comic format of the edited image, the deeper thematic reference to cake ingredients does not extend to the visualization of layers. Thus, intricate layers such as the deep red jam are not depicted in the visual storytelling mechanism.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The comic strip format eschews detailed culinary representation for visual humor and storytelling. It doesnâ€™t render the individual ingredients or their arrangement as showcased in a real cake's cross-section.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The comic does not convey the intricate detail of a cake's layers as seen in a real photograph. Instead, the elements of a cake, such as the golden sponge base, are suggested rather than visually explicit in the comic's style.",
      "weight": 3,
