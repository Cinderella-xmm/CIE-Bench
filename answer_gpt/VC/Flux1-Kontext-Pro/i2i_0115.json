      "question": "Does the edited image retain the figure's iconic screaming posture and facial expression, including the wide-open mouth and hands on ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure has a different posture and facial expression when compared to the original 'The Scream.' Instead of the iconic screaming posture with hands on ears, the figure in the edited image holds a stick and stands amidst flames. This different posture and context suggest a change in their expression and intent. Therefore, the edited image does not retain the original's iconic posture and expression.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure wears a blue garment similar to the original painting. While the face is blurred, the garment's color and overall style remain consistent with that of the original image, suggesting that this aspect has been retained.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the figure positioned on what appears to be the edge of a bridge or platform, similar to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the figure standing amidst flames, not on a bridge or platform as seen in the original image (Image A). The environment has changed significantly, indicating they are no longer positioned like in the original.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) does not use the same swirling, distorted style for the figure's limbs and body characteristic of conveying anxiety and fear as seen in the original image (Image A). Instead, lines representing flames envelop the figure in a more straightforward manner.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has different artistic elements compared to the original. Although the fire utilizes a swirled brushstroke style, the overall technique is different in the edited image, especially in how the environment is depicted. Image A incorporates these swirling textures more broadly, characterizing the original's distinct style.",
