      "question": "Is the sun-shaped ceiling light fixture present and positioned at the center of the ceiling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ceiling light fixture has a distinctive sun shape and is located in the center of the ceiling. This is evident from the radial design around the central light source which resembles sun rays, a recognizable characteristic of a sun-shaped light. The central position is determined by its placement relative to the bed and overall room layout, confirming its centered position.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floor tiles are indeed light beige and arranged in a square grid pattern.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a lamp is present on the bedside table, but it does not have a traditional patterned shade or metallic base.
