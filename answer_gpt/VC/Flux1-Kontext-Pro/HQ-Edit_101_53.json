      "question": "Are the characteristic forehead wrinkles of the pug present and accurately represented in the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture of the pug shows prominent forehead wrinkles, typical of pug characteristics. The wrinkles are well-defined and accurately capture the texture and appearance one would associate with a pug. This suggests the sculptor has accurately represented the pug's defining features. The visual recognition of these wrinkles is based on common knowledge of a pug's physical traits.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the black muzzle and surrounding facial marking (including under the eyes and around the nose) preserved in the same location and shape as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture depicts the black muzzle and markings around the eyes and nose. The black coloration remains consistent with typical pug markings known from world knowledge. Comparing to Image A, while both maintain the key configuration of facial markings, the shades and shapes do have subtle differences; however, the general location and idea are maintained. This analysis utilizes pug facial structure understanding, focusing on common breed markings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the large, round, dark eyes with clearly defined pupils preserved in the same position and shape as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture features large, round, dark eyes with visible pupils. The eyes are accurately positioned on the pug's face, aligning with common pug traits. Comparing this to Image A, both images portray the eyes similarly, preserving typical pug expressions and positions. This observation relies on distinguishing pug eye characteristics and their expression impacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the floppy black ears positioned symmetrically on top of the head and shaped as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the pug sculpture with ears that have a dark hue, unlike the solid black shown in Image A. Both images depict ears in a similar drooped position, which is common for pugs, suggesting symmetry and appropriate ear placement. This comparative reasoning draws on breed-specific ear placement knowledge.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the pug depicted in an upright sitting position with both front paws placed forward, matching the original stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture shows the pug in an upright sitting position with its front paws forward, reinforcing typical pug posture. Comparing with Image A, both images show this stance similarly, indicative of breed-specific sitting habits. The understanding is based on commonly observed seated positions for pugs.",
      "weight": 2,

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the fawn-colored body area preserved in the same region as the original, contrasting with the black facial mask?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a fawn-colored body area consistent with pug coloring norms, contrasting well against the darker facial markings. Image A similarly displays this color distinction, maintaining regional consistency for breed-specific aesthetics. This analysis relies on recognizing standard pug body and facial color differences.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the head-to-body proportion consistent with the original pug, maintaining a broad head relative to the compact body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture shows a broad head in relation to its compact bodyâ€”a distinctive pug characteristic. This proportions comparison with Image A shows both representations keep common pug dimensions, especially the breed-standard head-to-body ratio. Understanding is based on general pug morphology standards.",
