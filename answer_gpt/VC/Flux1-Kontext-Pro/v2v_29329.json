      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the baby's head appears mostly bald with minimal hair. The skin tone is visible on the head, and there are no distinct hair patches indicating a full head of hair. This is common in infants, as they may not have a lot of hair initially.",

      ],
