      "question": "Is the radish character’s body still a white oval with a pointed bottom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is a radish with a white, oval-shaped body that tapers to a pointed bottom. This shape is consistent with the typical appearance of a radish. The visual cues in Image B clearly show this characteristic shape, which aligns with the world knowledge of a radish's form.",

      "question": "Are there exactly three green leafy sprouts growing from the top of the radish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the radish character has three distinct green leafy sprouts. This is visually clear as the greens are prominent and well-defined, matching the typical appearance of radish leaves sprouting from the top. The general understanding of radish anatomy supports this observation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the radish character features two small black circular eyes, a simple curved smile, and pink spots on its cheeks representing blush marks. This face design is a standard approach in cartoon depictions to give an inanimate object a friendly and cute appearance, which matches what is seen in the image.",

      "question": "Is the radish wearing a pink frilly tutu around its midsection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the radish character is depicted wearing a pink frilly tutu around its midsection. This is evident from the styling of the garment that encircles the radish character's waist area, a typical representation in cute illustrations to add a whimsical element.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a continuous red leash is shown extending from the radish character’s right hand to the dog's collar. This visual element is clear and connects the two characters, symbolizing the control and connection between the radish and the dog during their walk, which is a common scene in pet walking illustrations.",

      "question": "Is the dog light brown with darker brown ears and tail tip, and wearing a red collar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog has an overall light brown coloration, but it does not display darker brown ears and tail tip. Instead, the dog wears a blue outfit with a matching hat rather than showing these specified features. The outfit obscures these potential color variations. However, the dog wears a red collar beneath the blue attire. The presence of the blue attire is an added element over the previous depiction in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sidewalk is not visible. The setting has changed to a snowy landscape, and the characters are depicted walking on snow rather than a sidewalk with distinct tiles and grout lines seen in Image A. The transition to a full winter scene eliminates these specific ground features.",
      "weight": 2,

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the radish and the dog are shown moving forward together on a snowy surface. However, the radish is not positioned ahead of the dog; instead, they are side by side, illustrating companionship. This contrasts with the layout in Image A, where they share a similar pace but on a sidewalk, which is now a snowy ground.",
