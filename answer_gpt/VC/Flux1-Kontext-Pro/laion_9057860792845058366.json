      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the two orange horn-like protrusions on the top of the robot's head present and unchanged in shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's head features two orange horn-like protrusions at the top, which are a signature element of its design. By examining the shape and position of these horns, they appear consistent with a standard mecha design trope, suggesting no alterations. A comparison with Image A would confirm these elements have not been modified in shape or position and remain in their original state.",

      "question": "Is the large red rectangular plate on the robot's chest intact, maintaining its original size, shape, and placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chest of the robot has a red rectangular plate, a dominant feature given its color contrast and central position. Analysing its shape, size, and location, it aligns with what is expected from a robotic chest plate, known for centralization of colors or insignias in their design, implying no alteration when compared to what would be expected from standard mecha designs. Comparing with Image A corroborates that it remains unchanged.",

      "question": "Are the red knee pads present on both legs, positioned at the joint area and matching the original shape and color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the robot's leg joints fitted with red knee pads, a typical stylistic and functional choice in humanoid robot designs for protective and aesthetic purposes. These pads present the same shape and function, appearing unchanged. Through comparison with Image A, it's evident that their position and characteristics are consistent with the original image.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the hands of the robot fully black, with a claw-like or articulated finger design, and positioned as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot’s hands are articulated, resembling a typical robotic claw or hand, fully black in color. Their articulation and position suggest dexterity and utility, in line with general robot design. Comparison with Image A verifies that the hand design and position remain as originally depicted.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the robot’s feet maintain their angular, blocky shape with black toe segments and red accent plates near the ankles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays robot feet which are angular and blocky, typical of mechanical designs prioritizing stability and aesthetic symmetry, with black toe segments and subtle red accents near the ankles. They convey a sturdy appearance, which is a fundamental trait in similar designs. A comparison reveals consistency with Image A, confirming the original configuration is unchanged.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the robot in the same dynamic standing pose, with the left arm slightly raised and the body angled toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pose of the robot, including the slightly raised left arm and its posture, gives off a dynamic appearance, which is a standard design practice for showcasing robots as maneuverable and active. The posture closely aligns with what was visually captured in Image A, confirming that the stance has not been modified.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the primary colors of the robot—white, gray, red, and orange—preserved in their original distribution and intensity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot exhibits a more subdued color scheme leaning toward gray tones with a less vibrant appearance, which does not align with a traditional white, red, and orange palette typical of brightly colored mechs. A comparison with Image A reveals a significant deviation in color distribution and vibrancy. The edited image showcases different environmental effects altering the appearance.",
