      "question": "Does the edited image retain the child's original shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child appears to have a more defined and colored appearance, with distinct colors in the clothing and hair. In terms of position, the child seems to occupy the same general location in both images, as evidenced by the alignment with the heart-shaped balloon. Since the overall composition resembles the same setup, the position is retained while the shape appears slightly enhanced.",

      "question": "Is the round red balloon retained in its original shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "The round red balloon in Image B maintains its circular shape and seems to be in the same vertical alignment directly above the child's head as seen in Image A. This indication suggests neither shape nor position of the balloon has changed.",

      "question": "Is the heart-shaped balloon retained in its original shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "The heart-shaped balloon retains its characteristic shape with a red color and a black outline. Its position is consistent with its placement in Image A, at a similar height and distance from the child who seems to be reaching out towards it.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "yes",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child's arm and hand are extended towards the direction of the heart-shaped balloon, which is the same gesture observed in Image A. This suggests that the action of reaching remains unchanged.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the relative positions of these elements remain consistent. The child is located beneath the round red balloon and extends an arm towards the heart-shaped balloon. This alignment indicates that their relational positions have been maintained.",
