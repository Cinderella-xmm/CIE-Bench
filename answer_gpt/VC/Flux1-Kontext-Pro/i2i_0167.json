      "question": "Does the apple retain its glossy red skin with visible white specks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apple displays a bright red skin that appears glossy due to the light reflections and visible white specks scattered across its surface. The use of lighting enhances the glossiness, which is visibly consistent in all views shown in Image B. This suggests that the apple maintains its glossy appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the short dried stem still present on the apple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apple is shown from multiple angles, and in all views, there is a short, brown, dried stem prominently sticking out from the top of the apple. This indicates that the stem is present in the edited image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the apple displayed on a wooden surface in all views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the apple in various orientations, and in each quadrant, the apple is placed on what appears to be a light-colored wooden surface. This consistency across all views indicates the apple is indeed displayed on a wooden surface in each instance.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The different angles shown in Image B depict the apple maintaining a consistent rounded shape that is typical of apples. There is no distortion in its shape or volume, which remains realistic across all views provided.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cross-section view of the apple reveals that the apple's flesh has a soft, somewhat grainy texture, typical of what a real apple's interior looks like. The seeds are visible in the center, adding to the realism. The texture appears consistent and appropriate for a real apple.",
