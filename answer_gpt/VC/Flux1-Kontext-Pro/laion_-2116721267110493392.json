      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boy on the right is shown with a smooth head, characteristic of being bald. The visual cues clearly depict a lack of hair, which matches the common characteristics associated with baldness.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visual indications of glasses on the first boy. Typically, glasses would be noticeable on the face, and since there isn't any seen, it's reasonable to conclude that the boy does not wear black-framed glasses.",

        "No"
      ],

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While examining Image B, the scene depicted is cartoonish and vibrant, indicating an adventurous classroom setting, though it is not clear that it is directly on a tablet screen. Since the digital scene seems vibrant and colorful, the answer applies to the depicted fictional content within the cartoon background.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no backpack visible; the scene illustrates a cartoonish classroom adventure without actual classroom items like backpacks, supporting that in this edited cartoon setting, the backpack is not present.",
