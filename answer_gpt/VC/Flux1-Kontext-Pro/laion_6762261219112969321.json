      "question": "Are there two separate, cushioned backrest sections positioned side by side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backrest consists of segments that visually appear to be distinctly puffy and characterized by a cloud-like, fluffy texture. Despite the modification in texture and appearance, these sections maintain their side-by-side arrangement as indicated by the continuation across the sofa. Therefore, they correspond to the functionality of separate backrest sections.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays armrest-like elements on either side of the sofa, integrated with the fluffy structure and matching the sofa's design in alignment with the seat cushions.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sofa features four points touching the ground, matching the typical distribution of legs at each corner of the couch. This alignment with common furniture design supports the presence of four legs, despite the alterations in appearance like the fur covering.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
