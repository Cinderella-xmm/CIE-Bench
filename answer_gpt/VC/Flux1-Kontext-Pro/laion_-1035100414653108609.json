      "question": "Is the text \"NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK, WASHINGTON, D.C.\" present at the top center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK, WASHINGTON, D.C.' is clearly visible at the top center. This analysis is straightforward as the text is placed prominently and logically at the top of the image. Often, such text indicates the location or the theme of the image, typical for postcards or informational images. Image A also features this text in the same location, reinforcing the layout that is commonly used for identification purposes.",

      "question": "Is the text \"WART HOG\" present at the bottom center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'WART HOG' is clearly visible at the bottom center. This is confirmed by the legible text that identifies the subject of the image. Image A also features this text in the same position, a consistent placement that serves to identify the animal pictured in both images.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the ground beneath the warthog covered with dry, pale yellow straw?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground beneath the warthog is not covered with straw; instead, it shows a forest scene with natural earth and greenery. Typically in zoos, animals are often depicted on straw bedding, as is evident in Image A, which features such a bedding style.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background behind the warthog a dark green-brown gradient, resembling an indoor or shaded enclosure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a forest scene with trees and greenery, not a dark gradient or indoor setting. Typically, gradients or solid color backgrounds suggest confinement or enclosure settings, but the presence of detailed outdoor elements in Image B negates this. Image A does feature such a gradient, showing a more enclosed setting.",

      "question": "Is there a white border surrounding the image, separating the artwork from the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no distinct white border separating the artwork from the edges as seen in standard postcard depictions. This is confirmed by the entire image being filled with artwork, unlike Image A which features a clear white border around the image.",

      "question": "Is the code \"5A-H618\" present in the bottom right corner of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the code at the bottom right corner is '5A-H314', not '5A-H618'. Typically, these codes are unique identifiers for images or prints, which makes them crucial for differentiating between versions or prints. Image A bears the code '5A-H618', confirming a different identifier.",
