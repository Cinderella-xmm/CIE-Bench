    "Question": "Q1: Are there exactly eight upright objects arranged in a tight vertical cluster within the container?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are eight upright objects that visually resemble decorative stir sticks or similar items, arranged vertically inside the container. This can be concluded by counting the individual objects with tips pointed upwards, forming a cluster. By using visual cues and counting them individually, we confirm the total number is eight.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a bed of small, uniformly shaped spherical objects filling the lower portion of the container?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lower portion of the container does not contain any small, spherical objects. Instead, it appears empty except for the vertical objects arranged inside. The absence of spherical objects is apparent from the transparency of the container, showing only the lace decoration and upright objects.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a decorative band located precisely at the upper rim of the container?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a lace decorative band around the upper section of the container, but it is positioned slightly below the rim. This band is visually distinct and wraps around the container, yet it does not align exactly at the container's upper rim, affirming its placement slightly lower.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the container transparent, allowing full visibility of the contents inside?",
    "explanation": "Based on Image B, the container is transparent as it allows clear visibility of the objects inside, including the vertically placed objects and the lace decoration. This is evident from the ability to see through the glass material of the container, confirming that it is indeed transparent.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are all the objects positioned vertically, with their tips pointing upward?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, all the objects inside the container are placed vertically with their tops facing upward. This is noticeable as each object's structure is consistently aligned vertically, indicated by their parallel arrangement, typical when filling a container of this type.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there at least three distinct sizes of objects visible in the cluster (large, medium, small)?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the objects visible in the cluster are uniform in size, specifically in terms of height and structure. They resemble identical decorative sticks, lacking identifiable variations in size such as large, medium, and small distinctions. This uniformity suggests the objects are of a single size group.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the container resting on a flat, horizontal surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the container is resting on what appears to be a reflective, flat surface resembling a tabletop or mirrored surface. This can be concluded by the reflection seen beneath the container, indicating a stable, flat, and horizontal support that holds the container.",
    "answer": "Yes"
