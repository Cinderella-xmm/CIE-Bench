      "question": "Are the original colors of the bicycles preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycles are presented in a red, blue, and black color scheme. Upon analyzing Image A, the red and black colors are preserved while a cream-colored bicycle in Image A is modified to blue in Image B. This demonstrates a change in color for one of the bicycles. Thus, not all original colors are preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the original designs and structural details of the bicycles preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycles maintain structural features such as frames, handlebars, and wheels similarly to conventional designs of bicycles. In Image A, the bicycles exhibit identical structural designs and components, suggesting that the structural aspects have been preserved in the edited image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the original arrangement and relative positions of the bicycles preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a row of bicycles that have relative placements to each other: they are aligned in a single file predominantly facing the left. Evaluating Image A reveals the same spatial arrangement and positioning of the bicycles. Thus, the original placement and spatial relationships are preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the shadows cast by the bicycles and their alignment with the window grid preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycles cast shadows that align with the window grid, which is evident from how the pattern on the floor aligns with the window structure. Analyzing Image A shows a similar alignment of the shadows with the grid, indicating that the shadows and their arrangement are consistent in both images.",

      "question": "Is the warm, diffused lighting from the window preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits warm and diffused lighting emanating from the window, creating a soft and ambient feel. Comparing this with Image A, which also shows warm lighting that permeates through the window, it is evident that the lighting quality is preserved in the edited image.",
