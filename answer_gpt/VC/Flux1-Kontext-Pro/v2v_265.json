        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe a locomotive with a rectangular grille at the front center, a common feature in locomotive design for ventilation. Image A, showcasing a more industrial and realistic train, also includes this grille at the front center of the locomotive, serving the same functional purpose.",
