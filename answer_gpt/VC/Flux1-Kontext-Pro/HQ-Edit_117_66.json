      "question": "Are there exactly four dragons, one in each quadrant of the cover?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the cover in Image B, the cover features elaborate carvings which include dragon depictions. With knowledge of typical designs, these are likely placed in quadrants. However, visually verifying without detailed close-up confirmation is difficult on smaller resolution images. World knowledge about quadrant designs suggests this is a favored layout for symmetry and balance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a central circular compass composed of concentric rings with inscribed characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central part of the cover in Image B shows a circular pattern with concentric rings and small, repeated elements. Through recognition of common compass motifs combined with decorative elements like inscriptions, the central design clearly resembles such a compass, likely intended to mimic traditional navigation or astrological instruments.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a star-shaped pointer located at the center of the compass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the center of the compass design features a pointed, symmetric object resembling a star with its extended tips. This shape is common in traditional compass designs, often representing directional indicators or focal points.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the dragons arranged symmetrically around the central compass, with each facing toward the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts dragons positioned around the centrally-placed compass. Given their placement in a symmetrical pattern across different quadrants, they appear to be oriented towards a central focal point, coinciding with the compass's symmetry; a common stylistic choice to enhance harmony and completeness in design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the dragons separated by cross-shaped lines dividing the cover into four equal quadrants?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The photograph displays lines meeting centrally on the cover, resembling a cross. In alignment with traditional quadrant divisions, these lines effectively create structured separations among the carved dragon depictions, allowing each dragon to inhabit its quadrant.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there Chinese characters inscribed within the concentric rings of the central compass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While examining Image B, the concentric rings feature small, character-like markings. They are similar to written symbols, potentially resembling Chinese characters often used in traditional embellishments on old navigational tools or manuscripts for decorative and informative purposes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the dragons have coiled bodies with raised heads and extended claws, consistent with traditional Chinese dragon depictions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Evaluating the dragons in Image B, they appear to exhibit features typical of Chinese dragons, such as sinuous, coiled bodies, and dynamic, lifelike postures including raised heads and claws. Despite the image's scale limiting detail resolution, the consistent depiction across known cultural iconography supports this characteristic conclusion.",
