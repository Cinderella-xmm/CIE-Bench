      "question": "Are the round wire-rimmed spectacles present on the elderly gentleman's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, Image B, the visual details of the elderly gentleman indicate that his face is blurred, making it impossible to discern if he is wearing spectacles. Common sense suggests wire-rimmed spectacles would be visible if present, but due to the blur, we cannot confirm their presence.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gentleman's hair is visible and appears white, but the blur obstructs visibility of facial features like a mustache and goatee. Without clear visual information, and considering common illustrations where facial hair is noticeable, it is safer to conclude the lack of visible facial hair.",
