      "question": "Does the open umbrella retain its circular canopy shape with visible radial ribs converging at a central hub?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene features a fantastical landscape with a tree, flowers, and a moonlit sky. Unlike Image A, there is no open umbrella with visible radial ribs or a central hub present in Image B. The scene in Image B is more like a painting or a surreal illustration, not depicting an umbrella in either an open or closed state.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the closed umbrella present with a black casing, wrist strap, and metallic tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a whimsical scene with a tree, flowers, and a late evening or night sky, but there is no element in this image that resembles a closed umbrella with any specific features like a black casing, wrist strap, or metallic tip.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the starlit sky with visible stars and nebulae still present as the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is shown with celestial bodies, notably stars and planets, against a blue backdrop. While this can resemble a starlit sky with stars, it does not show the complex features of nebulae typically associated with the night sky. Thus, it possesses elements of a celestial background, but not identical starlit sky with nebulae as seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the scene composed with flowers in the foreground, a hill in the midground, and the sky in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a composition that includes flowers prominently in the foreground, with a hill-like form supporting a tree that represents the midground, and the sky fills the background. This confirms the scene's layout, which matches with the typical visual arrangement of foreground, midground, and background elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the black support ribs visible and extending from the central hub to the edge of the canopy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of an umbrella, open or closed, let alone one that includes black support ribs or a canopy structure. The image is an artistic scene of a natural landscape, thus lacking any umbrella components.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are yellow coneflowers and red poppies present in the foreground of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both yellow flowers resembling coneflowers and red flowers resembling poppies are visibly situated in the foreground. This suggests the presence of these types of flowers, contributing to the composition of the scene described.",
