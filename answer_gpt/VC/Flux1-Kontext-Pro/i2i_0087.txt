    "Question": "Q1: Is the clock face still white after the edit?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face is a circular component displaying the time. Observing its color, it remains white, just as in the original Image A. Based on my knowledge of typical wall clocks, white clock faces are common for minimalist designs.",
