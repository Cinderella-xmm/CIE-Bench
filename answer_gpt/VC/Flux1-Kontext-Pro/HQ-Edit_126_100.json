      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the child still seated on the edge of the path near the water container, facing away from the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a noticeable context and thematic shift from a realistic depiction to a more fantastical style. The house is now perched on tree limbs rather than traditional stilts, and there is no clear evidence of a path or a child seated by it. The character at the bottom of Image B is standing rather than sitting, and the setting appears to be a whimsical environment rather than the more realistic setting in Image A. Thus, the child is not present in the same context as Image A, suggesting a different setting altogether.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the curved concrete path extend from the bottom right corner of the image toward the house without deviation or interruption?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysing Image B, there is a distinct path visible, but it differs from the typical concrete path seen in Image A. Instead, the path in Image B appears to be more natural, blending into the environment, aligning with the fantastical theme. The surface and the surroundings suggest it is not a traditional concrete path, and thus, it implies deviation in design from Image A's path.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a smaller building with a rusted corrugated metal roof visible to the left of the main house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shift to a fantastical environment resulted in significant changes to the scene's elements. There is no smaller building with a rusted metal roof visible; instead, the focus is on one main fantastical house sitting on tree limbs. This directly contrasts with Image A, which has multiple buildings, including one with a rusty metal roof.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Are the large green banana leaves and the cluster of bright orange flowers clearly visible in the foreground, just below the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shift to a fantastical scene led to the presence of different vegetation and design elements. While there are orange-like objects in the environment that could resemble flowers or fruit, the specific cluster of large banana leaves and bright orange flowers as seen in Image A do not appear prominently in the foreground below the house in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the satellite dish located on the right side of the upper floor, extending outward from the structure on a black metal pole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B feature a satellite dish. In Image B, the satellite dish is indeed present on the right side of the upper segment of the house. It extends outward, which is a similar placement as Image A, showing continuity despite the shift to a fantastical theme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the lower ends of the stilts firmly planted in the soil along the slope beneath the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the house is uniquely supported by tree limbs rather than stilts planted in soil, as was the case in Image A. The fantastical design negates the presence of traditional stilts along a slope, replacing them with natural foliage limbs supporting the structure.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the background composed of rolling green hills covered in dense forest, fading into mist under a partly cloudy blue sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B retains a background with lush greenery and a blue sky, the scene takes on an enchanted forest appearance. There is no clear depiction of rolling hills or mist as inferred in Image A. Instead, it focuses on enhancing the whimsy with towering, dense trees filling the area around the fantastical house.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a fantasy-inspired scene is depicted with vibrant natural elements, but not with a distinct cluster of orange flowers next to a banana plant as in Image A. Although orange elements are present, and greenery abounds, the specific arrangement and type as described are not identical.",
