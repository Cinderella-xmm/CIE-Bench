    {

      "question": "Is the figure in the top-right corner still shown with its right arm raised high, holding a weapon aloft?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top-right object shows a plush fish and not a figure. The fish is positioned facing left, with fins and eyes typical of a plush toy. The original content likely contained a figure with an arm raised, holding a weapon, but in Image B, there's no such characteristics. Thus, comparing the description provided with the object visible, the plush toy does not adhere to the same positional or characteristic details.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the figure in the bottom-left corner still show a hand gripping a curved blade in its right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom-left position is occupied by another plush fish. These toys have fins, not hands, and aren't designed to grip objects such as a curved blade. Given the context of the original description referencing a blade-holding position, the transformation to a plush fish negates this feature in Image B.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the figure in the bottom-left corner still in a kneeling position with one knee on the ground and the other leg bent forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottom-left plush toy in Image B is not in a kneeling position but rather rests on its belly, typical of plush toys that don't usually depict humanoid postures like kneeling. Consequently, the plush fish can't replicate the humanoid physical stance described in the original context.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the figure in the top-left corner still face slightly to the left with its head turned toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a plush fish in the top-left position is oriented toward the right of the frame. The features of plush toys, such as fish toys, are not articulated to offer a head turn in the manner of a humanoid figure. Thus, the details described do not correspond with the object visible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the figure in the bottom-right corner still hold a long, vertical weapon in its right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the provided Image B, the plush fish positioned in the bottom-right does not feature hands or weapons. Instead, as a typical plush toy, it displays fins with no capabilities or design to hold objects like vertical weapons. Thus, it diverges significantly from the description suggesting weapon holding.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the left leg of the top-right figure still bent backward, supporting a forward lunge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in the top-right of Image B shows another plush toy fish, which does not have legs or mimic any lunge position since plush toys tend to be more static and less anthropomorphic than the figures described initially. As a result, the fish toy cannot replicate the human-like pose.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a skull-shaped pendant visible around the neck of the bottom-right figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom-right object is a plush fish with no neckline, pendant, or adornments like skull-shaped jewelry. Plush toys, especially fish-shaped ones, are typically plain or patterned in textures and do not have detailed dress features like pendants. Therefore, this feature is absent in the observed image.",
