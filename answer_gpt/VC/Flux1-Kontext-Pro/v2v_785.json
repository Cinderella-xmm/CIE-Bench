      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's hair color is shown as brown. Although it is depicted with a different art style typical of manga, which often uses minimal colors and simplified forms, the color of the character's hair remains consistent across both images. My conclusion is based on the visual presentation in Image B, which uses color to indicate the character's hair is brown.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted wearing a red shirt. The use of color and the style of the shirt closely match what is worn by the character in Image A, despite the differences in artistic style. My reasoning is based on the visual cues where the color red is consistently used for the character's shirt in both images.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the frisbee held by the character and shown in the context of interaction is bright green, consistent with the bright green frisbee shown in the original Image A. The use of color in this case is clear and matches between both images despite the change in art style.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes visual elements of a grassy park setting with multiple trees, aligned with the setting provided in Image A. Despite the stylized and more cartoonish presentation in Image B, the essential elements such as grass and trees are observable and suggest a park environment.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is shown holding the frisbee in the first panel and then throwing it in the second panel. This depiction indicates interaction with the frisbee. The sequence of interaction is explicitly depicted through the storyline visualized across the two panels.",
