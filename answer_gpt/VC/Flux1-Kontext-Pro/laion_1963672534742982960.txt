    "Question": "Q1: Are the eyes of the figure still bright blue with clearly visible irises?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is enclosed in a snow globe, and without clear visibility due to the blurred region, the visibility of the eyes is compromised. Since the eyes are not discernible beneath the blurred area, we can conclude that they are not effectively visible. Therefore, the figure does not have eyes that are bright blue with clear irises in the snowglobe.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the facial texture still characterized by deep, horizontal and vertical wrinkles and a cracked, stone-like pattern?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, despite the blurred face, the rest of the figure, which is consistent with Image A, shows similar rugged textures characteristic of wrinkles and a stone-like pattern, suggesting continuity of the texture. The common characteristic lines and patterns seen are those of the White Walker representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the figure still shown with long, white hair extending past the shoulders?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, we observe long white hair that extends down beyond the character's shoulders. This is consistent with the depiction of the character from typical representations of White Walkers in popular culture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the figure still have a full, white beard covering the lower face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure retains the depiction of a full, white beard, which is noticeable below the blurred part of the face. This characteristic aligns with the representation of the character in the original Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the facial contours, including the jawline and cheekbones, still clearly defined and consistent with the original?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while the blurred face obscures some facial details, the lower part of the face suggests defined contours below the beard area. This consistency with the original is based on visible areas that maintain structure similar to Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the neck still visibly defined and structured, showing a clear transition from head to torso?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents the figure inside an enclosed snow globe, which slightly obscures specific anatomical transitions like the neck. The structure is less pronounced, not clearly showing a distinctive neck transition compared to Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
