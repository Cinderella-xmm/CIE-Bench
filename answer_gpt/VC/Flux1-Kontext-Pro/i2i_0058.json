      "question": "Does the edited subject (anthropomorphic bull) maintain the rightward walking posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the anthropomorphic bull is facing straight ahead rather than rightward as observed in the original elephant in Image A. The bull's head and body orientation indicates a forward movement along the path rather than walking towards the right. This shift in posture signifies a change in the walking direction of the subject in Image B compared to the one in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the saddle and seating arrangement for the riders preserved intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an anthropomorphic bull being ridden by a single knight in armor, unlike the original elephant in Image A that carried two individuals in a structured saddle. The armored bull in Image B does not have a saddle of the same type as the elephant, which had clearly visible seating arrangements. Therefore, the saddle and seating arrangement are not preserved intact.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the riders still positioned directly atop the anthropomorphic bull, maintaining their original relative height from the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rider (a knight in armor) is positioned directly atop the anthropomorphic bull. Comparatively, the original image had two individuals seated on an elephant, which is a natural animal. The height of the knight on the armored bull, considering the size and probable proportions, maintains the general positioning and relative height from the ground as seen with the riders on the elephant in Image A. Therefore, the positioning is maintained.",

      "question": "Does the dirt path retain its uneven and natural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both the original and edited images, the path shared similar visual textures. In Image B, the dirt path appears natural and retains a texture that suggests it is uneven, similar to Image A, which indicates the path's continuity between the images.",

      "question": "Is there natural foliage visible framing the sides of the path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, natural foliage is visible on both sides of the path, framing it just as in the original image. The trees and greenery create a natural environment in Image B, consistent with the scene presented in Image A where similar natural foliage is present on either side of the path.",
