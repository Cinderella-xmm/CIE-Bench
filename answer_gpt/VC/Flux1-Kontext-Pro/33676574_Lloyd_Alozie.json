      "question": "Is the distinctive golden lattice framework of the Address Downtown tower visible and structurally intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower on the left has a very distinct and intricate golden lattice pattern. Based on architectural knowledge and visual cues, this is characteristic of the Address Downtown tower. The presence of this design feature in the image suggests the framework is intact. The robot in the foreground does not obstruct the view of this lattice framework.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the cylindrical shape and curved top of the Emaar Tower preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Emaar Tower, known for its cylindrical shape and curved top, is obstructed by the large robot. While the general skyline includes tall structures, the specific outline of the Emaar Tower cannot be discerned due to the robot's placement.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the Address Downtown tower located to the left of the Emaar Tower in the skyline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Address Downtown tower is identifiable by its distinctive golden lattice design. The position of this tower in the image is to the left of the large robot. Assuming the Emaar Tower, which is blocked by the robot, is usually to the right of the Address Downtown tower in this skyline, the positioning remains unchanged.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the beige, low-rise buildings with arched windows visible in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground is dominated by the lower part of the robot and the surrounding cityscape, which does not prominently feature the beige, low-rise buildings with arched windows that would be expected in this skyline. The focus remains on the structures that are usually taller.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the large building with a green roof and illuminated frontage visible in the midground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is predominantly focused on the city's skyscrapers and the large robot, without distinct attention to any large building with a green roof and illuminated frontage in the midground. The lighting and angle do not highlight such a feature clearly.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the sky uniformly dark blue with no visible clouds or stars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky appears dark blue, which is consistent with a clear night. The presence of distinctly lit circular shapes floating near the large central tower does not represent stars or clouds, disrupting the otherwise uniform sky.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the tallest, tapering skyscraper in the background visible with a glowing crown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not clearly outline the entirety of a tapering skyscraper with a glowing crown due to the dominating presence of the large robot figure in the scene. Such a feature is not clearly visible, though the Address Downtown tower has a glowing section.",
