      "question": "Is the clock face present with Roman numerals I through XII arranged in a circle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face is clearly visible with Roman numerals I through XII arranged in a circular fashion around the clock hands, which is typical for such clocks. This configuration of numerals is common for analog clock faces, which display numerals in a sequence from I to XII.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the clock face located directly above the central arched opening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face is positioned directly above the central arched opening. This arrangement is a typical architectural feature where clock faces are placed above key architectural elements such as arched openings.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the top of the tower feature a pointed gable with finials at each corner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the tower exhibits a pointed gable design. Additionally, there are finial-like features at each corner, which are small, decorative architectural elements often placed on top of pinnacles or gables.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there two arched windows on the left and right sides of the tower, positioned symmetrically below the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no clear indications of two symmetrically positioned arched windows below the clock face. Instead, the structure seems to have large arch-like apertures, but they are not symmetrically positioned windows.",

      "question": "Is the undamaged stone surface of the tower uniformly light gray with visible cracks and rough texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stone surface having a uniformly light gray color. The surface appears to have visible cracks and a rough texture, which is characteristic of aged stone work, contributing to a weathered appearance.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there an intact arched opening directly above the clock face, forming a decorative frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no intact arched opening directly above the clock face. The architecture directly above is solid and part of the overall structure without any decorative frame or arched opening.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the tower maintain a tall, narrow vertical profile with distinct horizontal divisions at the base, middle, and top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower has a tall, narrow vertical profile, typically observed in traditional clock towers. There are distinct horizontal sections that define the base, middle, and top, which is a common architectural design for adding structural distinction and aesthetic appeal.",
