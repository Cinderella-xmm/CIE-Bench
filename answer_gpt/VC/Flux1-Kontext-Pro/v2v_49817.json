      "question": "Is the pencil sharpener still present and serving its function in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B (the edited image), the pencil sharpener is visibly located on the table. The leftmost individual is interacting with it, implying that it is still serving its function as a pencil sharpener. This conclusion is reached by observing the hand position of the individual operating the sharpener, which is consistent with typical usage.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the three individuals still interacting in their respective roles (scribe, observer, attendant)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the three individuals are still present and engaged in what appears to be similar roles as in Image A. The individual on the left appears to be sharpening a pencil, which aligns with the role of a scribe. The large individual is seated and observing the activity, aligning with an observer role. The central individual stands between the two, maintaining an attendant's positioning. This arrangement is based on body posture and position in the image.",

      "question": "Are the large windows still visible in the background of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B clearly shows large windows, which are visibly similar to those in Image A. These windows provide light and context to the room setting, maintaining the visual continuity between the two images.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there still scattered papers and pencils on the table in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In examining Image B, scattered papers are visible on the table alongside what appear to be pencils. This suggests that the setting has not changed materially in terms of the items present and that the table remains in use for writing or drawing activities.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spatial arrangement of the individuals in Image B remains consistent with Image A. Each person's relative position to the others and their engagement in roles suggests that their positions have not significantly changed between the images. This is deduced by comparing body posture and proximity in both images.",
