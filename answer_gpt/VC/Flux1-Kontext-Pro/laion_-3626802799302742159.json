    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the cookies still golden-yellow in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cookies' surface appears golden-yellow, evident from their bright and warm hue, characteristic of baked cookies. This coloration suggests they have been baked to a typical doneness level. The golden-yellow color can be attributed to ingredients like butter and eggs, often used in cookie recipes.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a red jam filling in the center of each cookie?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows cookies with a bright, red center, indicative of a jam filling. The vivid red color stands out against the golden-yellow cookies, suggesting a fruity jam like strawberry or raspberry, commonly used in such cookies. This design adds both visual appeal and flavor variety to each cookie.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the mug white with black speckles and a handle on the right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mug is predominantly pink with darker speckles. This design does not match the description provided in Q3, as the mug is not white, and its handle orientation cannot be determined solely from the image. The visual presentation contrasts with a typical black-and-white speckle pattern.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the plate pink with a speckled texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plate in Image B looks pink and features a speckled texture. The speckles add a patterned look to the plate, matching the design elements that are common in dishware seeking a contemporary aesthetic. This analysis is based on its hue and texture visible in the image.",
      "weight": 2,

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are some cookies inside the mug and others arranged on the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, cookies are clearly placed both inside the mug and some scattered on the plate. This arrangement not only maximizes space but also highlights the cookies display, offering an inviting presentation typical in food photography that showcases the baked goods' charm.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do both the mug and the plate have a speckled surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both the mug and the plate in Image B feature a speckled surface. This texture provides a cohesive design theme across the pieces, creating a visual unity typical in dishware sets. Speckles add an elegant touch to the otherwise plain surfaces.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the mug smaller than the plate and positioned centrally on it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mug appears smaller than the plate as it is placed on top of it, approximately centered. This perspective aligns with typical dishware arrangements where a cup or mug is centrally positioned on a saucer, suggesting an organized and balanced presentation.",
