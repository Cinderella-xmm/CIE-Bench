      "question": "Is the mushroom cloud shape (with a distinct stem and cap) present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the explosion is depicted with a clear stem and a large, rounded cap, resembling the characteristic shape of a mushroom cloud commonly associated with nuclear explosions. This is evident from the rounded top that expands outward, and the vertical column beneath it. Using world knowledge, a mushroom cloud typically appears after a substantial explosion, forming a stem and cap due to the upward force and expansion of gases. Thus, Image B shows a typical mushroom cloud shape.",

      "question": "Is there a landmass beneath the explosion in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible landmass illustrated directly beneath the explosion. It is shaped like an island, with the explosion stemming from above it. Analyzing the image shows the distinct outlines of the island base, evident from the different colors used to depict the ground versus the explosion. This visual separation indicates a region where the explosion is above solid ground.",

      "question": "Does the sea surround the island in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows an island surrounded by a blue area, which represents the sea. The depiction of the island is enclosed by this blue expanse, indicating water on all sides. Recognizing that islands are typically surrounded by water, the depiction of blue around the landmass confirms that the sea envelops the island.",

      "question": "Are palm trees visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, palm trees are visible in the foreground and around the perimeter of the illustration. These are depicted with elongated trunks and broad leaves, distinct features of palm trees. By combining knowledge of tree forms and recognizing their tropical association, these elements are consistent with palm trees.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the explosion positioned directly over the island in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the explosion is depicted as emanating from the island, meaning it is directly positioned over the landmass. The mushroom cloud expands upward from the island's base and fills the sky above it. This direct correlation between the island and the explosion clearly shows that the position of the explosion is directly above the island.",
