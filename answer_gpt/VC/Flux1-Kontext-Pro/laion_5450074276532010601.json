    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the \"Schildkröt\" brand name visible on the ball box and/or paddle surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central focus is the cartoonish treasure chest containing the ping pong paddles. The use of cartoon style and the illustration semantics doesn't clearly expose detailed text or brand identifiers like 'Schildkröt' on any items depicted, which is often the case with abstracted cartoon depictions.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the paddles clearly depicted with one red rubber surface and one blue rubber surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration shows the treasure chest containing ping pong paddles. The paddle surfaces are illustrated with clear, distinct red and blue colors, which are traditionally associated with ping pong paddles. The illustration style simplifies complex textures but maintains these color indicators.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a diamond-shaped logo present on the handle of each paddle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration in Image B adopts a cartoon style, focusing more on shapes and vibrant colors over detailed logos. The handles of the paddles in this type of quality and abstraction do not visibly feature any logo shapes like a diamond.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are exactly two paddles included in the set?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a treasure chest with two paddles visible inside; each is identified through distinct paddle handles emerging from the chest. While visually abstract as a cartoon, it aligns with the traditional set depiction of two paddles in the context of ping pong.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is a rope handle visibly attached to the left side of the box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is a cartoon, with no direct depiction of the physical packaging box from Image A. As such, there's no feature consistent with a rope handle; instead, a treasure chest setup is illustrated without such attributes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a horizontal partition inside the box that separates and holds the paddles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a stylized cartoon treasure chest rather than a literal box with partitions as seen in Image A. The chest does not show internal structures like partitions, rather focuses on the objects within like paddles, characteristic of illustrative exaggeration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the box have a rectangular shape with a hinged lid that opens upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image B visualizes a treasure chest, which deviates from a typical rectangular box seen in Image A. The treasure chest is a common trope in storytelling, often shown with a hinged lid visually analogous to an upward-opening mechanism but it's positioned within a different contextual shape.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
