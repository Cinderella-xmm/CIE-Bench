    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are both feet positioned en pointe, with the right foot slightly ahead of the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the statue's left foot is pointed forward and flat on the base, while the right foot is positioned behind, also resting flat on the ground. In ballet, 'en pointe' refers to a position where feet are fully extended and balanced on the tips of the toes, which is not the case here since both feet are flat. There is no elevation or point-based posture observed in the statue's stance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both arms extended laterally from the body, with palms facing inward and fingers gently curved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue's arms are positioned away from the body but not fully extended laterally. The arms are bent, with the right arm positioned slightly in front of the body and the left arm slightly to the side. The palms appear to face downward rather than inward, and the fingers are gently curved. The description of lateral extension with inward-facing palms does not fully align with this arrangement.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the head turned to the left, with the chin slightly raised?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the visual cues in Image B, the statue's head is facing forward and not turned to any side. The chin is neither raised significantly; it remains in a neutral position aligned with the statue's posture. There is no indication of the head being turned to the left.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the legs fully extended and aligned vertically, with the spine slightly arched backward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue's left leg is slightly bent, and the right leg is positioned behind with a clear bend at the knee, which deviates from a fully extended vertical alignment. The spine is not noticeably arched backward; instead, it maintains an upright posture without exaggerated curvature.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the arms positioned at approximately hip level, extending outward from the sides of the torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the statue's arms are positioned such that the left arm is slightly at hip level and extending outward, but the right arm is positioned more upwards rather than directly to the side at hip level. This creates an asymmetry and does not match the description of both arms being at hip level.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the upper body slightly tilted forward while maintaining vertical alignment through the spine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the upper body of the statue is upright without any recognizably forward tilt. The statue maintains a vertical alignment through the spine without tilting forward, adhering to a balanced and stable posture expected in classical sculpture.",
