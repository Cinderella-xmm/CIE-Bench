      "question": "Is the original lighting style, including the placement and intensity of shadows, preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadows indicate that light is coming from windows, casting distinct grid-like shadows on the floor and a shadow on the wall behind the chest of drawers. The lighting is detailed and suggests an authentic natural light setting commonly found in interiors with large windows. Analyzing Image A shows similar characteristics where light is streaming from a window, casting shadows of the clock and plants on the wall. However, the placement of shadows in Image B differs slightly presumably due to the different architecture and placement of windows. Therefore, while both images feature natural light, the shadows' placement due to architectural changes is different.",

      "question": "Are the items on the chest of drawers arranged in a similar fashion to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a white vase similar to the original image and features a clock on the chest of drawers, similar in function, rather than having books and greenery as in Image A. The arrangement style in terms of items' functional symmetry is preserved (clock and vase), but specific items (books and second vase) are not present, which alters their arrangement compared to what is seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the wooden parquet flooring texture still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floor is a wooden parquet flooring with a distinct pattern of arranged wood pieces, observable by the grain and structured pattern artisans typically design for parquet floors. Image A also shows a patterned wood floor, common in many interiors for aesthetics under furniture such as drawers. The parquet design is clearly consistent in style and quality.",

      "question": "Is there a large piece of furniture serving as the primary storage unit in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the storage unit consists of a tall cabinet next to a drawer buffet, which collectively comprises a large piece of furniture. This is similar in functionality to Image A where a broad chest of drawers serves as the primary storage unit. The concept remains, with minor design changes in size and structure, but both serve the primary purpose of storage, consistent with design logic.",

      "question": "Is natural light still illuminating the scene from the same direction as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second image, light is coming through the windows on the left, casting shadows across the floor and wall. Image A exhibits similar lighting from the left side, exemplified by shadows of objects extending across the wall and floor. Despite architectural variances reflecting the room's purpose, the light directionality is similar hence preserving light directionality consistency.",
