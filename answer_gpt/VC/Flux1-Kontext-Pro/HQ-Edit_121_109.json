    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the red hummingbird feeder with a transparent cylindrical reservoir and red base present in the same position and form as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hummingbird feeder is indeed similar in design, with a transparent cylindrical reservoir and red base, resembling the feeder in Image A. However, while Image A depicts the feeder hanging prominently on the right side of the frame, Image B shows it positioned more centrally and slightly to the right, indicating a change in spatial orientation. Therefore, the feeder is not in the same position and form in both images.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the thin vertical string suspending the hummingbird feeder visible and extending upward from the feeder’s top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, a thin vertical line is clearly visible, extending from the top of the hummingbird feeder, suggesting it is suspended in space. This matches the visual cue in Image A, indicating continuity in this detail across both images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the circular wooden table located on the right side of the image, with four cups and saucers arranged on it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B shows no presence of a wooden table with cups and saucers, indicating that this element is absent from the scene. In contrast, Image A clearly displays the table with these elements. Therefore, the described table setup is missing in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the teal-colored house with white-trimmed windows visible on the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any visible structure resembling a teal-colored house with white-trimmed windows. This component is notably present in Image A, but its absence in Image B suggests a significant alteration in background elements between the two images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the gray-blue house on the right side of the image fully covered in green ivy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon reviewing Image B, there's no indication of a gray-blue house. Unlike Image A, where a house is partially covered with ivy, Image B alters the scene, especially on the right side, omitting any house structure.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a narrow grassy pathway running from the foreground toward the misty forest in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a grassy pathway can be inferred in the background's alignment typical of a garden setting. While Image A explicitly shows a pathway leading from foreground to background, Image B does not reveal a pathway that distinctly heads towards a misty forest, limiting compatibility.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the arch-shaped canopy of green leaves forming a frame at the top of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's foliage, but it doesn’t align with the description of forming an arch-shaped canopy. Image A presents a detailed arch-like leaf structure, framing the top. The absence of this explicit detail in Image B suggests a deviation in compositional elements.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there dense clusters of pink, yellow, purple, and red flowers visible in the foreground garden?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a natural setting synonymous with an array of colorful flowers, including pink, yellow, purple, and red. Despite modifications in layout or presence, the vegetative diversity presents in the foreground aligns with the description, consistent with a rich garden aesthetic as seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Is the scene illuminated by soft, diffused sunlight coming from above, casting gentle highlights on the foliage and flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the lighting suggests a soft, ambient illumination that highlights natural elements. The overall light distribution mimics exposure typical of diffused sunlight. Conversely, Image A similarly uses lighting to enhance lush vegetation features.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q10",
      "question": "Is the hummingbird positioned near the feeder, facing it directly, as if about to feed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hummingbird is positioned adjacent to the feeder with its beak oriented directly towards it, simulating a feeding stance. This alignment mirrors that of Image A's depiction of a hummingbird in proximity to the feeder, reflecting the natural bird-feeder interaction common in such scenes.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
