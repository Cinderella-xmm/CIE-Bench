    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the ears upright and positioned symmetrically on top of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject exhibits long, upright ears that appear to be positioned symmetrically. This conclusion is drawn by visually observing the placement and orientation of the ears on the head, combined with the knowledge that symmetrical placement often indicates natural positioning.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the dark-framed glasses positioned directly over the eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows dark-framed glasses on the subject. Despite the lack of visible eyes due to the blurred area, the position of the glasses is such that it's reasonable to conclude that they would logically be placed over the eyes as per the standard way glasses are worn.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a red patterned bandana wrapped around the forehead, above the glasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no red patterned bandana is visible above the glasses. The subject's head is adorned with braids and decorations, but no bandana fitting the description is present. The absence of distinctive bandana patterns confirms this.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the white fur texture visible on the head and upper neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The white fur on the subject's head and upper neck is apparent in Image B, as seen in the texture and color that resembles fur. This observation, combined with the expectation of fur presence on such a character, supports that the white fur texture is indeed visible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the braids extend downward from the neck area and appear to be made from the subject’s own fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The braids in Image B extend downward from the head region, and they appear integrated as if made from the subject’s fur-like features. This is concluded from their continuity with the fur-like texture of the rest of the head, suggesting they are part of the subject’s composition.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the head turned slightly to the left, with the gaze facing forward toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body orientation and the visible symmetry of the head imply a frontal facing direction, with no clear indication of the head being turned to the left. The alignment suggests that any forward gaze would be directly at the viewer rather than angled.",

      "model_answer": "No",
