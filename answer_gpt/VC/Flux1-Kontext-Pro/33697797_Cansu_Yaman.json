        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the setting appears more fantastical with a lush jungle environment, featuring a waterfall and no visible floor that resembles a typical gray stone-paved surface. The lower part of the image is covered with vegetation, in contrast to the first image which has a visible stone-paved floor. Thus, the gray stone-paved floor is not present in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting features elaborate jungle aesthetics with wooden branches and foliage covering the structure, giving it an organic look. There are geometric patterns but they resemble glass and vines rather than metal beams or industrial grid patterns. The first image contains obvious metal supports and grid patterns typical of a modern greenhouse, so based on the fantasy-like appearance of the edited image, the metal support beams and grid patterns are not visible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there are no shelving units with visible wheels as the structure seems natural with tree-like platforms. The original image features modern shelving units with wheels which are not present in Image B. Thus, wheels attached to the base of shelving units are not visible in this edited setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains fantastical platforms serving as plant holders, which do not display the black plastic pots seen in Image A. The platforms are organically integrated as part of the larger tree structures rather than separate elements. Thus, black plastic pots are not visible in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the composition is filled with large, fantastical plants and structures, so no single large plant with broad green leaves stands out in the specified location as it did in the first image. Instead, the scene is dominated by the overall forest environment. Therefore, such a specific plant is not distinguishable as described.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited version presents a more chaotic and natural scene with no visible aisles because the layout involves cascading platforms and vegetation covering the area. In contrast, the first image shows a defined central aisle bordered by modern shelving units. Image B lacks this arrangement, indicating no clear aisle exists.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a mostly open ceiling structure with green vine-like elements, consistent with a natural jungle theme. There is no discernible woven shade canopy visible, unlike in Image A, where the shade is an evident feature in the greenhouse roof. In the edited image, the ceiling is integrated into the lush background scenery without distinct shading.",
