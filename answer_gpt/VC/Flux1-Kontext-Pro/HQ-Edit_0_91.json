        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the multicolored floral patterns are visible on the sleeves and shoulders, featuring a variety of colors such as red, blue, yellow, and orange.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair appears neatly styled, with a part on the left side and swept back as would be traditionally expected.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the background has shifted from a beige textured surface with reddish-brown smudges seen in Image A to a more structured design featuring defined lines and patterns reflective of traditional woodblock prints. Thus, the background textures and smudges are not present in the same form.",
