      "question": "Does the edited image retain the airplane's wings, engines, and tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the airplane still clearly has its wings, engines, and tail. The wings spread out horizontally from the fuselage, the jet engines are visible beneath the wings, and the tail stands vertically at the rear of the aircraft. These features are consistent with the standard structure of an airplane, indicating that they have been retained in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the airplane still positioned on the runway in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the airplane is positioned such that its landing gear is firmly on the surface of a runway. The area below the aircraft and surrounding it visually resembles typical runway textures and features, including the painted markings signaling the runway and its boundaries. This suggests that the airplane remains positioned on the runway.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image still feature a golden sunset background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B prominently displays warm colors and the lighting characteristic of a sunset. The sky is filled with shades of orange and gold, consistent with how a sunset typically appears. This suggests that a golden sunset is still present in the edited image despite additional elements like lanterns.",

      "question": "Are the runway markings (\"10\" and guiding lines) still visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the markings on the runway, specifically the large number '10' and the guiding lines typical of airport runways, are clearly visible. They serve as guides for pilots during takeoff or landing and are depicted prominently, indicating their continued presence in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a faint line representing the horizon is visible. Along this line, silhouettes of distant trees can be observed, resembling a natural landscape view from a distance. This matches typical features of a landscape horizon line and indicates that it remains in the edited image.",
