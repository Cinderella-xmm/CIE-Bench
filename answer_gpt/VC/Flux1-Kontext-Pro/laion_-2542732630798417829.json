      "question": "Is the glass bulb shaped like a teardrop with visible internal filaments present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the comic-like artistic style depicts a character and a bulb, where the bulb is drawn in a way that indicates an elongated shape similar to a teardrop, and the filament inside it is visible as glowing lines. Such depiction aligns with the traditional Edison-style bulbs. Therefore, the stylized representation includes the teardrop shape and internal filament details, even if exaggerated for comic effect.",

      "question": "Are the curved vertical bars forming a cage-like structure around the bulb present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the comic-style depiction of Image B, the bulb is enclosed within a series of curved vertical bars that resemble a wireframe cage surrounding the light bulb. This structure is portrayed to provide a whimsical, animated character representation, reflecting the wire cage commonly seen in industrial pendant lights.",

      "question": "Is the dark cylindrical housing at the top of the fixture with a visible screw detail present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the top of the bulb features a character's head that incorporates elements of a light fixture design. Although the comic transformation alters some characteristics subtlely, there's a cylindrical shape at the top that reflects the idea of a housing. This is part of how the image anthropomorphizes the bulb fixture into a character, maintaining the concept of the light fixture assembly with imaginative adaptations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The comic depiction in Image B features a light bulb character that seems to include parts resembling a fixture. While the realistic specifics of such a fixture component may be artistically exaggerated or simplified, there appears to be a semblance of a base structure at the bottom, akin to the circular cap seen in industrial light fittings.",

      "question": "Is the glass bulb positioned centrally within the metal cage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a whimsical character inspired by a light bulb design, and the bulb-like element is depicted centrally within surrounding frame-like bars that mimic a cage. Despite the cartoonish representation, this retains the visual principle of a bulb center within a fixture, fitting the context of the comic strip.",
