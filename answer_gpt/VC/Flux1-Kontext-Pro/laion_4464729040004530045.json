    {

      "question": "Is the woman in the edited image positioned in a three-quarter profile view, facing to the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the woman is facing slightly away from the camera, with her right shoulder and side of her body visible. Commonly, a three-quarter profile view shows the most visible part of a side profile along with a portion of the front. Judging by the posture and angle, she is indeed positioned with a three-quarter profile view to the left.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the woman’s head tilted downward in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman’s head appears to be held upright, parallel to the horizon, rather than tilted downward. Observing her neck position indicates that there is no downward tilt. Thus, her head is not tilted downward.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the woman’s arms positioned at her sides in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the woman’s arms are bent at the elbows, and her hands are held together at the front of her waist or slightly above. Her arms are not resting at her sides, which would show a different posture where arms are straight and aligned alongside the body.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the woman have white nail polish on her fingernails in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the woman's hands and nails, they appear to be predominantly neutral in color, matching closely with her skin tone or possibly a light pink shade. There is no dominant white color observed on her fingernails, indicating they are without white nail polish.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows the woman’s left side predominantly with visible shoulder, indicating she is indeed facing towards the left side relative to the camera frame. The direction she faces is consistent with being oriented slightly to the left.",
