      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the dancer's forehead doesn't visibly feature a bindi. A bindi is often a small decorative mark worn on the forehead. Since I can't see any contrasting dot or ornament on the forehead region of the dancer, it is reasonable to conclude that there is no bindi present.",
