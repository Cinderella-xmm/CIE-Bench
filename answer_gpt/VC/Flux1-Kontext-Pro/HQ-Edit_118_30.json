      "question": "Is the number \"1902\" clearly visible on the front of the locomotive?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the locomotive shows the number '1902' clearly. The number is positioned at the front of the train, which is a typical placement for numbering steam locomotives. The visual cue of the number's placement, combined with the clarity of the digits, ensures that the number '1902' is indeed visible.",

      "question": "Does the locomotive retain a dominant green color on its body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the locomotive is shown with a dominant green color, particularly noticeable on the main boiler area of the train. This agrees with the typical design of certain historic steam trains, which were often painted in bold colors like green. The visual cue of the green color on the train's large body area confirms its dominance.",

      "question": "Is the station building constructed from stone material with visible texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the station building with a stone-like appearance, where individual stones and their textures are visually distinguishable. This aligns with architectural practices for station buildings in rural settings during the early 20th century, which often used locally sourced stone. The visual texture on the building indicates that it is made of stone.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roof of the station building appears to have a greenish patch, suggesting the presence of moss. This is consistent with older stone structures that could accumulate moss over time, especially in rural or damp environments. The green hue's positioning on the roof helps identify it as moss.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows several items resembling luggage trunks placed on the platform near the passengers. These objects are box-shaped and are typical items that would be used for storing and transporting personal belongings, consistent with the time setting represented. Their appearance and placement on the platform indicate they are luggage trunks.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several modern wind turbines can be seen on the hilltop in the background. These structures are tall and slender, with blades characteristic of wind turbines used for generating electricity. Their presence in the landscape is easily recognizable and is a detail seen in both images.",
