      "question": "Does the edited image retain the sheep's four-legged body structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep is encased in a snow globe but its body structure remains visible. It has four legs positioned naturally under its body, which is consistent with the anatomy of real sheep. Despite being within the globe, the leg positioning and the overall bodily shape adhere to what one would expect in a typical sheep.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep's body is fully covered with a textured, curly coat that closely resembles the woolly fleece characteristic of sheep. The texture and the pattern appear realistic and typical of what is seen in real-life sheep.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the sheepâ€™s ears, eyes, nose, and mouth clearly visible and positioned in a way consistent with a real sheep?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image clearly displays the facial features of the sheep. Its ears are upright and appropriately angled on the sides of the head, the eyes are round and centered, and the nose and mouth are in the expected lower front position. These features are portrayed in a manner consistent with real sheep anatomy.",

      "question": "Does the clock retain a circular face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock is visually positioned next to the sheep within the snow globe, and it retains its circular shape, which is a fundamental design element of most clocks. This structural aspect has not been altered by the incorporation into the globe.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock in Image B distinctly features numbers 1 through 12 arranged sequentially around its circular face in a traditional clockwise manner. This arrangement follows standard clock design conventions.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the hour and minute hands visible on the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the hour and minute hands are clearly visible on the clock, enabling the viewer to discern the time it reflects. Their presence is essential for the function and recognition of the clock.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock's hands in Image B are positioned to indicate the time 10:10, with the minute hand pointing at the 2 (10 minutes) and the hour hand slightly past the 10, which is a common setup in clock imagery due to its symmetrical and aesthetically pleasing appearance.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep and the clock are situated next to each other inside a snow globe, indicating they are indeed in close proximity and part of the same scene. The spatial arrangement makes them appear as a cohesive object of interest.",
