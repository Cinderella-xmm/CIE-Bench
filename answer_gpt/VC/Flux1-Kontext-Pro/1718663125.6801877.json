      "question": "Is the crown-like forehead design with three dots and a central triangle present on the child's forehead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show a historical or period-style depiction, where the dress and overall attire are more elaborate and ornamented than the casual white shirt seen in Image A. The crown-like design is consistent with period portraits but not typically present in the attire depicted in Image B. Using world knowledge of historical portraiture, one can assess that the image does not present any visible or implied crown-like forehead design indicative of a classical period piece.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the lace-like borders encircling the eyes clearly visible and symmetrically drawn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a historical painting style where facial features like eyes are naturally depicted without embellishments like lace borders. Using common knowledge, such embellishments are atypical in classical art portraits similar to Image B without a facial focus due to the blurred area. Therefore, there are no visible lace-like borders as per the styling of Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the mouth depicted with a stitched, jagged-tooth pattern and vertical lines extending from the nose to the chin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is representative of a classical art style portrait where the focus is on the dress and general attire of the figure rather than any exaggerated or surreal facial features like a stitched mouth or jagged teeth, features which would be seen in modern fantasy or abstract art. From the general depiction style, Image B suggests no such unconventional facial drawings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the eyes positioned symmetrically and maintain their original almond shape and direct forward gaze?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central area where the eyes are supposed to be located is blurred, making it impossible to observe their position, shape, or gaze direction. Considering this artistic styling, symmetrical positioning is not visible. Thus, based on observations, there are no discernible eyes as per the blurred section.",
      "weight": 3,

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the makeup pattern symmetrically aligned across the left and right sides of the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is generally devoid of visible makeup patterns due to the blurred depiction, emphasizing historical attire rather than facial aesthetics. Therefore, without clear evidence of makeup presence or styling across the blurred face, symmetry cannot be determined. The artistic style generally excludes modern makeup details.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the nose bridge clearly defined and retains its original shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the editing style in Image B involving a blurred facial area, details like a nose bridge or specific facial features are obscured, aligning with a classic historical portrait style minus facial focus. Hence, the nose bridge cannot be seen or assessed clearly for original shape or position.",

    {

      "question": "Are the natural lip contours visible beneath the painted teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given the blurred facial section on Image B, any facial detailing like lip contours or crafted teeth designs are obscured and unobservable. The attire style orientates more towards posing classical garments like earrings and dress, not focus on facial features as indicated in the Image B artistic style.",
