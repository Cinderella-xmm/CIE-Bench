      "question": "Is the subject’s beard and mustache present and white in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image B displays a picture of a subject where the facial region is not clearly visible due to editing. However, the visible part of the subject's neck and attire suggests the presence of facial hair since the neckline closely matches typical arrangements seen with beards. As per usual observations, older individuals often have white beards due to graying hair. Image A also shows signs of facial hair, and the neck area combined with common knowledge about beard color matches this detail.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the subject have short, graying white hair with a visible receding hairline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image B, a part of the subject's hair is visible despite the obscured face, showing signs of short, graying white hair. Common indicators of aging and typical hairstyle seen with closely cropped hair suggest a receding hairline. Observing the similar region in Image A further confirms the presence of white hair as it corresponds with aging traits and short hairstyle.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the subject’s mouth slightly open, indicating speech?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image B does not provide visibility to the subject's mouth. Therefore, without clear depiction of an open mouth or other features associated with speech in the edited image B, any speculation on the mouth being open or indicating speech is not substantiated. The face is obscured, and the comparison with Image A does not suggest indications of speech.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the subject is wearing a dark suit jacket over a white dress shirt. The suit is clearly dark, and the shirt underneath is visible, which is white and of a style commonly associated with formal wear. This matches typical formal outfits with a jacket and dress shirt and corresponds with what is visible in Image A as well.",

      "question": "Is there a tie visible at the neck, knotted in standard fashion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image B clearly shows a tie visible at the neck, knotted in standard fashion, under a white dress shirt. The tie appears prominently beneath the jacket, in a typical triangular knot style. Common knowledge regarding formal attire supports the identification of a standard knotted tie, corroborated by the same features in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the subject’s eyes positioned symmetrically, with visible wrinkles around them, and a prominent nose and jawline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image B makes it difficult to confirm the positioning of eyes, appearance of wrinkles, or the prominence of nose and jawline because these facial features are obscured. Without clear visibility of the face, any assessment of symmetrical eyes, wrinkles, or an outline of nose and jawline is not feasible. Thus, based on Image A, these facial traits do not clearly align with the question.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the face illuminated from the front-right, casting subtle shadows on the left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image B, the setting suggests ambient lighting without evident directionality impacting the face due to the face being obscured. The presence of light and shadow effects on attire does not definitively reflect the illumination focal point for the face region. Review of Image A yields similar ambiguity in lighting direction, and thus assessing shadow casting is not determinate.",
