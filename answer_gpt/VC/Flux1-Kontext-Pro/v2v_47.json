        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seating area is depicted in a semi-circular arrangement, which mirrors the typical design of ancient amphitheaters, making it visually consistent with common amphitheater layouts such as those seen in the Colosseum. This arrangement is characteristic as it provides good acoustics and viewing angles. Compared with Image A, which also showcases the semi-circular seating arrangement, the edited image retains this feature.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the tiered wall with arches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a structure with a wall that is tiered and has arches, reminiscent of a classic Roman amphitheater's design where each tier allows for additional seating and multiple access points. Analyzing Image A, which similarly features multi-layered arches, it's clear that Image B carries over this architectural characteristic.",

      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the relationship between the seating and the stage area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear demarcation between the seating area and the central stage, which is consistent with amphitheater designs where the audience is arranged around a central performance space. Comparing this with Image A, which also depicts a central stage area surrounded by seating, the edited image maintains this fundamental layout.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays arches that are evenly spaced along the walls of the amphitheater, a typical feature for both structural integrity and aesthetic symmetry in classical architecture. A similar pattern is visible in Image A, where the arches are aligned uniformly. Thus, the edited image retains the even spacing of the arches.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image in Image B retains the distinctive elliptical shape and outline of an amphitheater, characterized by a semi-circular seating arrangement enclosing an open area at the center. Image A also reflects these characteristics. Despite being an illustration or model in the edited image, the overall architectural form remains consistent with that of a traditional amphitheater.",
