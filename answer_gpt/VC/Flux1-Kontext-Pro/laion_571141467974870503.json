      "question": "Is the number \"1423\" clearly visible on the front of the train?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, rather than showing a clear numeric label or any specific numbers on the train's front, the stylization and the pop-art nature of the image make it difficult to identify detailed text or numbers like '1423'. This is because the art style tends to replace specific text with more generalized artistic expressions. The comparison with Image A confirms the difference in clarity between a real-life photo and an interpretative drawing, showing that such labels are inherently less visible or transformed in artistic renditions.",

      "question": "Does the train have two circular headlights below a central white circular light on its front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From Image B, the train design suggests it has simple vent-like structures on the front rather than specific circular headlights as seen in real trains. This is a common feature of the stylized nature of pop-art drawings where realistic details morph into simplified shapes for thematic expression. Image A shows clear headlights accurately, which reinforces the stylized abstraction found in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there multiple vertical rows of white-framed windows on the side of the barn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, the barn side clearly displays several vertical rows of white-framed windows. The art intentionally captures architectural elements such as window patterns to maintain resemblance to the structure found in Image A but through a vibrant and graphic portrayal.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there two large wooden doors centered on the lower part of the barn’s front facade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the barn with a singular wooden structure that doesn't extend to two large doors centered at the facade's lower part. The art style often simplifies or alters real-life architecture elements for thematic or stylistic purposes, vis-à-vis the distinct doors shown in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the railway tracks extend forward from under the train and curve gently to the right into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the railway tracks distinctly extend straight forward from under the train towards the horizon, without showing any curving to the right as would be needed for a train turning gently. This direct approach is characteristic of graphical stylization, removing depth-derived curves. Comparison with Image A further supports the straight nature seen.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the yellow triangular warning sign with a blue border and the \"50\" speed limit sign visible near the track on the left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, near the tracks on the left, no yellow triangular warning sign with a blue border nor any '50' speed limit sign is visible, indicating that such nuanced signalling may be omitted or transformed into artistic elements that deviate from the original scene in Image A where those signs are discernable.",

      "question": "Is the train positioned directly on the railway tracks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the train positioned directly on the railway tracks, maintaining coherence with common functionality and logical depiction for trains and tracks even in stylized art forms. Comparison with Image A validates this positioning even amidst artistic expressions.",
