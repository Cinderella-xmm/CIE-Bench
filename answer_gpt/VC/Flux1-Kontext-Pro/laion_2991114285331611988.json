      "question": "Is the plaid pattern (with red, blue, and black intersecting lines) on the left tie preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tie on the left has a distinct plaid pattern featuring intersecting lines of red, blue, and black. The pattern's visibility in the image indicates preservation.

        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows an emblem pinned on the left side of the suit jacket, not on the tie itself. By analyzing this visual cue and noting the absence of any emblem on the tie, I concluded that the emblem is not present on the right tie in Image B.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
