    {

      "question": "Are the moss-covered rock formations along the stream clearly visible and preserved in their original positions and shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the moss-covered rock formations are present along the stream, they are altered slightly in position and shape due to additional fantasy-like elements such as glowing mushrooms and fairies. This contrasts with the natural scene in Image A where the moss-covered rocks maintain an untouched, realistic appearance. The presence of fantastical elements suggests that the formations in Image B are not preserved as in the original image.",

    {

      "question": "Are the mossy boulders arranged in the same sequence along the stream as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of mossy boulders is affected by the addition of fantasy elements, which are not present in Image A. In Image A, the boulders follow a natural, sequential pattern typical of a realistic stream, whereas Image B introduces new elements such as glowing mushrooms, influencing the sequence. Therefore, the arrangement does not match the original.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the pink flowers located in the lower right corner of the image present and unchanged in color and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, pink flowers are visible but their setting is altered due to fairy-like elements and glowing mushrooms. In Image A, these flowers are part of a more natural environment. Their presence in Image B is affected by the altered magical theme, indicating changes in context rather than maintaining original settings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the light beams enter from the top center and spread downward in the same diagonal pattern as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the light beams enter from the top center with dramatic, fantasy-themed illumination, rather than following the diagonal, realistic spread shown in Image A. This difference highlights the creative adjustments for a magical atmosphere in Image B.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there hanging vines extending from the upper branches of trees, particularly near the central canopy area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, hanging vines are replaced with fantasy-focused elements such as glowing mushrooms and fairy creatures, unlike Image A, where vines are an integral part of the natural forest backdrop. Thus, the vines are not preserved in the edited image.",
      "weight": 2,

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the stream follow the same curved path with multiple small waterfalls over mossy rocks as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stream's curvature and waterfall appearance are similar to Image A but accompanied by additional whimsical features, adjusting the overall pattern. While maintaining some natural characteristics, the fantasy enhancements imply changes.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the green moss texture consistently applied to tree trunks and ground surfaces in the same way as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The green moss texture in Image B appears less consistently applied due to the artistic addition of mythical elements such as glowing mushrooms and fairy-like creatures that alter the textural appearance compared to the consistent natural moss in Image A.",
