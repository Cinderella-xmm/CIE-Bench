      "question": "Is the bird’s crest upright and vividly blue, matching the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird’s crest is observed to be upright and possesses a vivid blue color, which is a characteristic feature of a Blue Jay. This physical description is confirmed through visual cues, as the crest appears prominently above the bird's head, similar to its natural appearance. For comparison, in Image A, the crest also appears upright and vividly blue, matching its typical style. This indicates that the edited image maintains the original image’s crest characteristics.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird features distinct white markings around the eye, accompanied by a black stripe running across the face. These are typical markings for a Blue Jay. This is consistent with its natural appearance, emphasizing contrast in the bird’s facial features. When compared to Image A, these facial features are preserved accurately, with similar white patches around the eye and a black stripe running through its face.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's wings exhibit clear white patches that stand out against the blue, reminiscent of clouds against a sky. This description aligns with the typical patterning of a Blue Jay's wings. In Image A, similar clear white patches are present on the blue wings, creating a consistent visual pattern between both images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's tail features vertical blue and black bars that conclude with white tips, a distinguishing feature of a Blue Jay. This stripe pattern is observed consistently and adds visual texture to the bird. In Image A, the same pattern of blue and black bars with white tips is evident. The continuity in tail markings between the original and edited images is clearly preserved.",

      "question": "Is the bird positioned on a wooden surface, maintaining the perching posture from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is positioned on a perch made of a small wooden log inside a decorative glass dome, distinct from being directly on a wooden fence as in Image A. Despite changes in the setting, the bird maintains a perching posture. Therefore, while a wooden element is present in Image B, the exact surface and setting differ from Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is predominantly colored in vibrant blue and white, which is indicative of a Blue Jay's natural color scheme. This analysis is based on the distinct blue on the back, wings, and crest, contrasted with white on the underbelly and wing patches. Image A exhibits the same color palette of vibrant blue and white. The colors in both images match and maintain the bird’s natural appearance.",
