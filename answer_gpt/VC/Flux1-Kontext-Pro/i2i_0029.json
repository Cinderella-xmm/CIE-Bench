      "question": "Does the image retain the stark black-and-white contrast characteristic of the zebra's stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra retains its natural markings, which are typically known for their stark black-and-white contrast. The stripes on its body are visibly contrasting, typical of how zebras are recognized and characterized by their distinct pattern. Based on the observed visual details, the image maintains the zebra's usual black-and-white contrast.",

      "question": "Is the zebra's mane still upright and striped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the zebra with its mane standing upright, which is characteristic of zebras. Zebras are known for their manes that often stick up due to stiff hair. The mane appears striped, consistent with a zebra's typical appearance. The details in the image confirm the retention of these characteristics.",

      "question": "Are the zebra's ears still pointed and visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's ears are clearly pointed and visible, positioned correctly on its head. This is typical of zebras, whose ears are usually upright and pointed, aiding in detecting sounds effectively. The visual information confirms these features as they are logically expected.",

      "question": "Is the zebra depicted in a grazing posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the zebra with its head down, appearing to be eating or grazing the grass. This posture is commonly associated with grazing animals, such as zebras, which typically lower their heads to feed on grass. The visual cues indicate the zebra is engaged in grazing activity.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a background filled with green grass, which remains consistent throughout. While there are added white stripe patterns, the primary composition of the background appears to be green grass. The visual cues and green color prevalence confirm the above analysis.",
