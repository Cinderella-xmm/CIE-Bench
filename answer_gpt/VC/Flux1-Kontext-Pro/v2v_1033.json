        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bee collectible clearly displays a pattern of yellow and black stripes on its body, consistent with common visual representations of bees.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings of the bee collectible are colored but not see-through, indicating that they are not depicted as translucent. The wings appear vibrant and solid, which aligns with typical depictions of bee wings in collectible designs where translucency is intentionally omitted. Observing Image A, the wings are similarly opaque, confirming consistency between the two images.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the flower collectible with yellow petals and a green stem. These colors are visually distinct and unmistakable, aligning with common flower representations in collectibles to emphasize vibrancy and contrast.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bee and flower collectibles positioned parallel to each other inside the display box, forming a clear side-by-side arrangement. This setup is common for presenting items in a box where a balanced display is preferred. Comparing Image A, the collectibles are also placed next to each other, which confirms a consistent arrangement without spatial adjustments.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the inside lid of the display box has the text 'ETERNITY BLOSSOM' prominently featured, illustrating branding or labeling typical in collectible box designs. This inscription is consistent with similar visual cues from packaging designs that emphasize identification. Verification with Image A shows this text was initially on a card, demonstrating a shift from card to box lid inscription in the edited image.",
