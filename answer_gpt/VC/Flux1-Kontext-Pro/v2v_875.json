      "question": "Is the brown, segmented, textured trunk of the palm tree present with visible horizontal ridges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm tree has a trunk that is visible and appears brown, matching the characteristics of a palm tree trunk. The texture and segmentation are apparent, showing horizontal ridges along the trunk. This is a typical feature of palm trees, as they often have trunks with a ridged surface due to the leaf bases left behind when fronds fall off.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the long, feathery green fronds forming a radial crown at the top of the palm tree present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the palm tree with a radial crown composed of long, feathery fronds that are characteristic of this type of tree. This crown formation is typical of palm trees, where the fronds spread out evenly around the top of the trunk.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are some of the palm frond tips visibly browned or dried?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, observation shows that some of the tips of the palm fronds have a brown or dry appearance. This browning is a common occurrence for palm trees, particularly in dry or stressful conditions, indicating some degree of aging or environmental stress on certain fronds.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the palm tree positioned to the left of the cactus and taller than it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering the positioning of the objects in Image B, the palm tree is placed to the left of the cactus and visibly taller than it. The cactus is shorter and positioned to the right, confirming the relative positioning between the two plants.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the palm fronds primarily green in color, with some yellowing or browning at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fronds of the palm tree in Image B are mostly green, with slight yellowing or browning observed at the edges. This is common in palm trees as fronds age and may indicate normal wear or environmental stress.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the palm tree maintain a tall, narrow trunk with a broad, rounded crown of fronds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The palm tree depicted in Image B indeed has a tall and narrow trunk, complemented by a broad, rounded crown of fronds. This structural form is typical of palm trees, where the trunk supports a wide array of fronds spreading out in a rounded fashion.",
