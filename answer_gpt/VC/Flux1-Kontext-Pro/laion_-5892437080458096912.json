    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the subject's face, including the almond-shaped eyes, straight nose, and closed mouth with red lips, preserved in the same position and form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features are intentionally blurred and altered. Visual cues that would indicate almond-shaped eyes, straight nose, and red lips are not discernible due to the editing. Therefore, even without referring to Image A, these features are not preserved identifiably in Image B.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the subject’s hair color (reddish-brown) and tightly curled, rounded hairstyle preserved exactly as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair is styled differently. It has a reddish-brown color and is arranged in a more loose or classical style appropriate to the historical surroundings, differing from Image A, where the hair is styled more elaborately and possibly includes intricate adornments. Hence, neither the hairstyle nor color is exactly preserved.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the jeweled headpiece with a single dangling pendant at the center of the forehead preserved in the same location and form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a different style of adornment, a circlet without the single dangling pendant seen in Image A. This indicates a change in both the location and form of the headpiece.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "question": "Is the right hand positioned on a decorative object (such as a hilt) and the left hand resting on the lap, maintaining the same relative placement and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands are free from any decorative objects, whereas in Image A, the right hand is positioned on a hilt. The left hand is placed differently in Image B, indicating a change in relative placement and orientation compared to Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skin tone appears warmer and slightly more golden than the pale tone seen in Image A. This indicates a significant alteration in skin tone, moving away from the original depiction.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and B, the subject maintains a forward-facing position with symmetrical posture. The visual cues and alignment indicate consistency in posture and direction.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the figure (head-to-body ratio, arm length, torso width) preserved without exaggeration or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
