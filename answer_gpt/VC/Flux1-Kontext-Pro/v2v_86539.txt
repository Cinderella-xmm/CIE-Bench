    "Question": "Q3: Does the potato character in the second panel remain inside a cardboard box, indicating sleep?",
    "explanation": "In Image B's second panel, the potato character is indeed inside a cardboard box, which suggests a sense of confinement and rest. The context of a box often provides a known visual cue for hiding or resting, akin to sleeping.

    "Question": "Q5: Are all three panels distinctly showing the activities of exercising, sleeping, and eating respectively?",
    "explanation": "The three panels in Image B depict different activities: the first panel with a headband suggests readiness for exercising but lacks action-related items like dumbbells; the second panel shows resting within a box suggesting sleep; the third panel depicts the character seated with food, indicating eating. Although the first panel lacks the specific action of exercising, it does imply preparation for it. The other panels clearly depict their respective activities. Hence, based on interpretation from given visuals, the sequence of sleeping and eating activities is clear. However, due to the lack of exercise in the first panel, the overall distinction for all activities isn't clear.",
