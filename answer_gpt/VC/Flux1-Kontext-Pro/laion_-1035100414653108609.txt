    "Question": "Q3: Is the ground beneath the warthog covered with dry, pale yellow straw?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ground beneath the warthog is not covered with straw; instead, it shows a forest scene with natural earth and greenery. Typically in zoos, animals are often depicted on straw bedding, as is evident in Image A, which features such a bedding style.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the background behind the warthog a dark green-brown gradient, resembling an indoor or shaded enclosure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a forest scene with trees and greenery, not a dark gradient or indoor setting. Typically, gradients or solid color backgrounds suggest confinement or enclosure settings, but the presence of detailed outdoor elements in Image B negates this.
