      "question": "Is the glass still recognizable as a standard cocktail glass with a cylindrical shape and a flat base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object that represents the glass is crafted in an earthen style with visible sculpted patterns. Despite being made from different material than the usual glass, the shape is still cylindrical with a discernible flat base, resembling a standard cocktail glass. This deduction comes from the visual cues of its cylindrical form and base, which are consistent with common cocktail glass characteristics.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible ice cubes in the glass, maintaining the appearance of a chilled beverage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible sculptural elements on top of the object resembling ice cubes. Despite the change in material from real ice to an earthen material, the objects maintain the geometric appearance typical of ice cubes in a beverage context, suggesting the intention to represent ice cubes in a chilled drink setting.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a slice of lime garnishing the rim of the glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a piece that resembles a slice of lime, placed on the rim of the earthen object. Despite being made from a different material, the object's placement and shape are consistent with how a lime slice is traditionally garnished on a glass, indicating its purpose as a garnish.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a metallic straw inserted into the cocktail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of a metallic straw, there is a cylindrical piece made from the same earthen material as the rest of the cup. The visual cue suggests a straw due to its position and shape, but no metallic aspect is evident; it's entirely crafted from the earthen material.",

      "question": "Does the surface beneath the cocktail retain a polished wooden texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a surface beneath the object that appears to be crafted from a similar earthen material, lacking the polished wooden texture seen in Image A. It instead mimics a rough, earthen texture, pointing to a change in surface material and texture from polished wood to crafted earth.",
