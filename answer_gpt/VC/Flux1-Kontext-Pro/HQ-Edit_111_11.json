      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the elderly man’s deeply wrinkled facial features, including the pronounced vertical lines on the forehead and crow’s feet around the eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since the face is blurred in the edited image, the facial features such as wrinkles, vertical lines on the forehead, and crow's feet around the eyes cannot be discerned. The blurring obstructs any assessment of specific facial characteristics, meaning a judgment cannot be made based on visual information.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the saxophone still present and held in the same manner, with the player’s left hand on the keys and the mouthpiece touching the lips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the object being held looks like a woodwind instrument with a clear visual indication of keys and a mouthpiece. The left hand of the musician is visible holding the instrument in an appropriate position resembling how a saxophone or similar instrument is held. However, due to the blurring on the face, it can't be confirmed if the mouthpiece is touching the lips, but its positioning suggests a likely contact.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the two glasses and the brown bottle still placed on the table in front of the musician, with one glass partially full and the other empty?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows two glasses and a brown bottle on the table. Through visual cues, the glass closest to the viewer appears partially full, while the other glass seems to be empty. The placement and relative fullness of the glasses and bottle have been retained.",

      "question": "Is the dark wooden tabletop still visible with subtle reflections of the glasses and bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a dark-colored tabletop with noticeable reflections from the glasses and bottle. The reflections are subtle but clearly visible, indicating that the surface still retains the same reflective quality.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the primary light source still positioned above and behind the subject, casting shadows on the left side of his face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there are multiple light sources visible above and behind the subject. The position of the lights suggests they could be casting shadows, but due to the blurred face, the shadows specifically on the face cannot be confirmed. However, the overall lighting atmosphere indicates a similar setup.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the musician's hands positioned correctly on the instrument. The left hand is seen supporting the lower section, and the right hand appears to be pressing the keys, which is consistent with the proper handling technique for saxophones or similar instruments.",
