      "question": "Are the industrial structures still positioned on the left side of the image, maintaining their relative arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the industrial structures are still clearly visible on the left side of the image. Although the image has undergone an artistic transformation resembling van Gogh's style, the structures maintain their original positions and arrangement as perceived from the visual cues. The edited image preserves the layout of these structures even though their appearance has been stylized.",

      "question": "Does the road still curve gently through the valley, connecting the industrial area to the rest of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a road that continues to curve through the valley, connecting the industrial area to the more distant parts of the scene. Despite the artistic changes, the edited image retains the road's characteristic gentle curve, which can be identified through its distinct placement and pattern that mimics the original image's layout.",

      "question": "Are there still frosted trees visible along the sides of the valley?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of trees along the sides of the valley is evident. Although transformed with artistic effects, the trees retain a frosted appearance due to the heavy use of cool colors, consistent with snow or frost stylization, which still suggests the original wintry conditions depicted in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the distant snow-covered peaks still visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains visibility of the distant peaks in the background. The edited image retains their placement, and the blue tones applied align with the representation of snowy peaks, preserving the visual essence of the background landscape seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the industrial structures still retain their general shape and form despite artistic modifications?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the artistic modifications, the industrial structures still maintain their fundamental shape and form. The edited image applies a stylistic effect, but the underlying structure is consistent enough to identify the shape and form as similar to those in Image A, reflecting the industrial features.",
