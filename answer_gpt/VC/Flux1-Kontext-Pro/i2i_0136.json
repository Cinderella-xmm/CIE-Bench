      "question": "Does the edited image retain the green stem at the top of the orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image of the orange, there is a green stem visible at the top of the orange. By focusing on the top portion of the fruit, it is clear that the green stem is present. This is consistent with what can be expected from an orange where the stem is commonly found.",

      "question": "Is the glossy texture of the orange still present on the keychain model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, we notice that the surface of the orange has a shiny, glossy appearance. This sheen is visible in the way light reflects off the fruit's surface. The glossiness suggests that the orange is depicted with a fresh, smooth texture. This textural detail is consistent with expectations for a real fruit that has a polished or naturally shiny appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the keychain primarily colored in an orange hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image exhibits the orange fruit primarily in a bright orange color. The hue is consistent with that of a natural orange fruit, which helps maintain the realistic depiction despite it being a keychain model. This color observation is supported by common knowledge of what color natural oranges typically have.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the surface imperfections and texture patterns of the orange persist on the keychain model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a surface texture characteristic of an orange, including minor bumps and dimples. These imperfections are natural for orange skin and are visually present in the edited image, suggesting that the textural characteristics are preserved. This reflects typical knowledge about the surface of oranges, which are expected to have such textures.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the keychain maintain a proportional size and shape relative to the plate it rests on?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the orange sitting on a small plate. The orange appears to occupy a substantial part of the plate, much like one would expect in reality. The relative size and round shape of the orange in comparison to the size of the plate imply that the proportions typical of an orange resting on a plate have been preserved. This is consistent with the expected dimensional relationship one would see between an actual orange and a small saucer.",
