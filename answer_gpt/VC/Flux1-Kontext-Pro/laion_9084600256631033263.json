    {

      "question": "Is the \"DATSUN\" text visibly present and centered on the front of the decanter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the decanter does not display any text that can be identified as 'DATSUN'. Instead, the front of the object features a Mercedes-Benz logo, indicating that the 'DATSUN' text is absent. This analysis is based on visual identification combined with brand recognition knowledge.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the \"240Z\" script visible on the side of the decanter near the front wheel well?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals no visible '240Z' script on the side near the front wheel well of the decanter. There appear to be other design elements and logos, but not the specific '240Z' script. This conclusion is reached by direct observation combined with knowledge of car branding.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the decanter maintain the long hood and short rear deck proportions of the original car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B retains the characteristic proportions of a classic roadster with a long hood and a relatively shorter rear deck, similar to sports cars' design language. This is visually apparent and understood by recognizing typical car design proportions.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are vertical slats visible on the front of the decanter, mimicking the original grille pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grille design does not contain vertical slats typical of some older vehicles. Instead, it has a grille associated with a Mercedes-Benz style, suggesting that there are no vertical slats as part of its design. This is determined by visual inspection and knowledge of typical grille designs.",

      "question": "Is the \"DATSUN\" emblem positioned centrally on the front face of the decanter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a central emblem that is not the 'DATSUN' branding but instead features a Mercedes-Benz logo. The absence of the term 'DATSUN' confirms this assessment. This conclusion is drawn from combining visual evidence with brand awareness.",
