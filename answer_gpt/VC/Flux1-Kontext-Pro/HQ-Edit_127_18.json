      "question": "Are the elephant's tusks present and curved outward in a natural arc, extending from the mouth and tapering toward the tips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant inside the display box features tusks that extend outward and curve in a natural arc, characteristic of elephant anatomy. The tusks taper elegantly toward the tips, maintaining a realistic and consistent depiction of elephant tusks. This aligns with world knowledge about the physical traits of an elephant's tusks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the elephant's skin display deep, wrinkled folds across the forehead, neck, and body, consistent with natural elephant dermatology?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elephant in Image B has skin textures that showcase deep, wrinkled folds, particularly across its forehead and body. These textures are consistent with the natural skin appearance of elephants, known for their thick, wrinkle-prone dermatology.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the acacia tree present with a broad, flat canopy and extended horizontal branches above the elephant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The acacia tree in Image B mimics those found in the African savanna, with a broad and flat canopy, characterized by extended horizontal branches. This is a distinctive feature of acacia trees, which are known for their umbrella-like shape.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the foreground covered in tall, golden-yellow grass blades that extend upward and show subtle motion from wind?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the diorama setting does not display tall grass blades in the foreground as described. Rather it features sparse patches of grass without the noticeable upward extension or suggestion of wind motion typical of an outdoor setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals a painted backdrop inside the diorama box, including a depiction of mountains with snow caps in the background. These form a distant ridge line behind the elephant, consistent with the painted representation of a mountainous horizon.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the elephant's trunk curled at the tip and showing segmented ridges along its length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elephant's trunk in Image B shows typical segmentation and slight curling at the tip, consistent with natural elephant anatomy, known for its muscular and flexible trunk structure.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the elephant's ears have a large, broad, fan-shaped outline with visible internal folds and a downward flare?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the elephant's ears with a relatively broad and curved outline that includes visible internal folds, resembling the typical fan-shaped ear structure of elephants which allows efficient body heat dispersion.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the lighting consistent with a source from the upper left, casting shadows on the right side of the elephant and grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B's diorama, lighting from above casts shadows and creates light effects consistent with a directional source from the upper left or top, causing the elephant and grass within the box to have shadows predominantly to one side. This matches general knowledge about lighting and how shadows behave in such settings.",
