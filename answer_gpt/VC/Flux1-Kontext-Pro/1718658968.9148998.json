      "question": "Are the two tall towers positioned symmetrically on either side of the central section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the architectural structure shows two tall towers that are identical in design and positioned on either side of a central section, creating a symmetrical appearance. This symmetry is a common architectural feature intended for aesthetic balance and structural design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a centrally located arched doorway with a wooden door beneath a rounded arch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central section of the castle structure clearly features a prominent doorway at the top of the steps. This doorway is characterized by its rounded arch, and it appears to have a wooden door. Such architectural features are typical in castle designs to provide entry points that are both grand and secure.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does a set of stone steps ascend from the water level directly to the arched entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground of the model castle shows steps leading up to the main entrance. However, it is crucial to note that the setting is on a wooden surface and not directly adjacent to water, as a real castle might be. This indicates a model or toy version where the context is different from natural surroundings.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there multiple rectangular windows with dark frames aligned vertically on each tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals several rectangular windows on each tower, aligned in a vertical fashion. These windows, commonly found in castles for aesthetic uniformity and functionality, contribute to the realistic detailing of the structure. However, their frames are not distinctly dark due to the wooden material's consistent color in the model.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the tops of both towers feature flat surfaces with crenellated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The towers in Image B clearly exhibit flat surfaces with crenellated edges, a common feature seen in castle architecture for defense purposes. These notched parapets serve both practical and decorative functions, which are accurately replicated in this wooden model.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a low stone wall extending horizontally from the right side of the castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a low wall is visible extending from the right side of the main structure, consistent with traditional castle designs where such walls are used to fortify the perimeter. This wall is part of the model's design, made from the same wooden material to maintain uniformity rather than stone.",
