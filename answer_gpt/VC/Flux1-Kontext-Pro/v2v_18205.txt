    "Question": "Q2: Does the elephant have two visible, curved white tusks extending from its mouth?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is depicted with two visible tusks extending from its mouth. However, they are not white; rather, they are a shade closer to the elephant's skin tone, blending slightly with the overall image. World knowledge suggests that tusks are typically white or ivory, but in this artistic rendering, their color matches the body to maintain a coherent aesthetic.",

    "Question": "Q6: Is the background a uniform beige color with a subtle paper-like texture and no additional scenery or objects?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background is not uniform or paper-like; instead, it appears to have a more textured and artistic look, suggestive of clouds or a painted backdrop, which does not resemble a simple beige color. The art style gives depth rather than a plain, paper-like texture.",
