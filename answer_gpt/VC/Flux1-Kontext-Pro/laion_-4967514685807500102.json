      "question": "Are the shrimp rendered in a pink-orange color consistent with cooked shrimp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shrimp are drawn with a vibrant pink-orange hue, which is typically associated with shrimp that have been cooked. This color is widely recognized as the indication of shrimp being prepared or cooked, as shrimp naturally change color to a pinkish-orange when heated. The consistent coloring in the cartoon illustration suggests a depiction of cooked shrimp.",

      "question": "Is there visible red spice coating on the shrimp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a depiction of shrimp with a reddish tint, suggesting the presence of red spice coating. This visual element in cartoon art implies spiced or seasoned shrimp, commonly represented with red or orange hues to indicate the presence of spices or seasonings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a cartoon illustration where the character holds a lemon, but the likeness of lemon wedges with visible rind and pulp is absent. The focus is more on the illustrative representation of using lemon as an ingredient, rather than realistic depiction of lemon wedges.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon illustration shows green herbs indicated by small green speckles sprinkled around the shrimp. This suggests the presence of finely chopped herbs, typical in culinary illustrations to infer seasoning and garnishing.",

      "question": "Do the shrimp maintain a curled, C-shaped form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shrimp are illustrated in a manner that indicates a curled or slightly C-shaped form. This is consistent with how cooked shrimp naturally curl into a C-shape due to the contraction of muscle fibers when heat is applied, and the cartoon shows alignment with this common shrimp form.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B is a cartoon depiction where the pan appears as a regular cartoon skillet without detailed features like rivets. The illustration focuses on a simplified representation typical of cartoon settings, rather than realistic detailing of kitchenware as seen in Image A's stainless steel pan with rivets.",
