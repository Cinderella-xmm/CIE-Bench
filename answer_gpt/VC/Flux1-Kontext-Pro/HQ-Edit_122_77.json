      "question": "Are the pink peony flowers with yellow centers still present in the hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible pink flowers with yellow centers incorporated into the subject's hair.

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dark green high collar still visible on the subject?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the subject wearing a green dress with a V-neck, not a high collar. A high collar would cover the neck and show little skin above the neckline, which is not the case here.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the lighting still soft and even, coming from the front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears evenly distributed across the subject, suggesting soft lighting. The uniform illumination on the visible features indicates that the light source is likely coming from the front.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the subject's eyes still dark brown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the face being blurred, it is not possible to determine eye color in Image B, making it irrelevant to assess.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the subject's face still centered in the frame with a frontal pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the alignment of the subject's face within the frame suggests a frontal pose and centering of the face, which can be inferred from the balanced positioning of the visible elements such as the shoulders and the dress's symmetry.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
