      "question": "Does the edited image retain the alternating tan and dark brown pattern on the turtle's shell?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the turtle is depicted as an anthropomorphized character with a stylized and smooth appearance, which does not showcase the detailed and natural patterning of tan and dark brown that is present in real turtles. Instead, the shell is a simplified, more uniform brown color, lacking the natural alternating pattern. This indicates a deviation from the natural color pattern of the shell seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the turtle's limb structure, even if the limbs are stylized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the turtle has been transformed into an anthropomorphic figure which retains the general presence of limbs, now stylized to resemble human-like arms and legs for a cartoonish appearance. While these limbs are not anatomically turtle-like due to clothing and anthropomorphism, the basic limb structure is maintained in terms of positioning and function.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the textured appearance of the turtle's shell?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shell of the turtle-character is much more stylized and smooth, lacking the detailed, rugged texture that is typical of a real turtle's shell as seen in Image A. The edited image opts for a more polished, cartoon-like texture, deviating from the intricate natural texture.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the turtle's head structure, including its visible eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the turtle's head is highly stylized for a cartoonish effect, but it retains essential head features such as the shape and placement of the eyes, albeit in a larger and more anthropomorphized form. The eyes are still clearly visible and positioned similarly to a real turtleâ€™s eyes, allowing recognition of the character as a turtle.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the turtle's limbs are represented in a smooth, stylized, and cartoonish manner, devoid of the intricate and textured appearance seen in the natural turtle limbs of Image A. The edited image features limbs that are simplified with clothing covering them, erasing the natural texture.",
