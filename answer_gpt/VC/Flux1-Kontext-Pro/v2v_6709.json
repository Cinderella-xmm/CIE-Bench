      "question": "Is the faceted star-shaped pattern covering the body of the perfume bottle preserved in the Lego version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the perfume bottle retains a faceted star-shaped pattern on the body as in Image A. The pattern is visible and appears to be the same. The reasoning is based on the visual cues, where the pattern remains consistent in both images.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the perfume bottle maintain its cylindrical shape with tapered sides and flat base in the Lego construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals that the cylindrical shape with tapered sides and flat base is preserved. The bottle in Image B has a similar form to Image A despite the edited LEGO element replacing the spray effect. The visual cues of the bottle’s shape remain constant.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the gold faceted spherical cap positioned at the top of the bottle preserved in the Lego version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold faceted spherical cap is visible at the top of the bottle just as in Image A. The consistency of the cap’s design is recognizable even with the added LEGO piece. This decision is based on the observation of the cap’s position and design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the spray nozzle located on the side of the bottle’s neck, with a visible mist plume extending diagonally outward, preserved in the Lego version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of Image B shows a LEGO construction piece extending horizontally from the nozzle position instead of a mist plume. In Image A, the mist plume was diagonal and outward; this feature has been replaced by the LEGO construction. The reasoning considers visual observation of alteration in mist representation.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the undulating folds of the fabric background beneath the bottle preserved in form and position in the Lego version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fabric background beneath the bottle shows similar undulating folds as Image A. Position and form are visually consistent. The analysis combines recognition of texture and alignment in both images, which indicates preservation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the perfume bottle positioned directly on top of the fabric background, maintaining contact and alignment with the folds, in the Lego version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottle in Image B rests directly upon the folds of fabric as seen in Image A, maintaining contact and alignment. Observation of placement and interaction with fabric folds remains consistent between the images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the size of the gold cap proportionally consistent with the body of the bottle in the Lego version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportional relationship between the gold cap and the bottle’s body matches more closely with Image A, where the cap complements the bottle size appropriately. The analysis considers proportion and scale regarding consistency between the images.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
