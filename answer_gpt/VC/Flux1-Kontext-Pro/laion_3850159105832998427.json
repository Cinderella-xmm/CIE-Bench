      "question": "Is the \"Gibson\" logo in gold script visible on the headstock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the headstock of the guitar is clearly visible, and we can observe a logo in gold script. From general knowledge, it is common for Gibson guitars to have the 'Gibson' logo in gold script on the headstock. Observing the image carefully, the logo matches the typical Gibson style with gold lettering. Therefore, the logo is visible in the image.",

      "question": "Are there exactly six fiery tendrils extending from the bridge to the headstock area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visual element of flames or fiery tendrils appearing in the image, mainly around the dragon but not clearly extending in a precise number like six from the bridge to the headstock. Fiery tendrils are a fantasy element, so there might not be exact numbers extending to the headstock as common guitar construction wouldn't allow for that design naturally. Thus, from the visual cues provided, it does not appear to have exactly six fiery tendrils extending as described.",

      "question": "Is the guitar oriented vertically with the neck pointing upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar is integrated into the body of a dragon, and the neck of the guitar is positioned vertically, pointing upwards towards the dragon's head. This orientation aligns with typical representations of guitars held upright, reaching above the center body part, which is common for a dramatic portrayal. The visual cue provided supports this orientation.",
