      "question": "Is the Eiffel Tower depicted with its characteristic lattice iron framework, including the four arched legs and tapered spire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower is clearly shown with its iconic design elements: the lattice iron framework, the four arched legs at the base which support the structure, and the tapered spire at the top. These are all distinct features of the Eiffel Tower known from world knowledge and prominent architecture of the tower.",

      "question": "Is the rectangular reflecting pool positioned directly in front of the Eiffel Tower, aligned along the central axis of the composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a rectangular pool in the foreground, visible as a central feature of the composition that aligns with the Eiffel Tower. This alignment is often used in photography and art to create symmetrical compositions leading the eye toward key landmarks, a common artistic and design principle.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the pathways and tree arrangements in the foreground arranged symmetrically around the central axis leading to the Eiffel Tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The paths and trees in Image B are organized symmetrically around the central axis that leads to the Eiffel Tower. This symmetry creates a balanced and visually pleasing composition, enhancing the focus on the monument and is often employed in landscape design and architectural planning.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a distinct spire-shaped building visible in the distance to the left of the Eiffel Tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, a distinct spire-shaped building can be seen in the distance to the left of the Eiffel Tower. This spire resembles well-known buildings like the Montparnasse Tower or other Parisian architectural elements with similar shapes. World knowledge tells us that Paris has a varied skyline with such structures.",

      "question": "Is the sun located in the upper-left portion of the sky, casting light from that direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sun is indeed located in the upper-left portion of the image, as evidenced by the light rays emanating from that direction and illuminating the scene. This positioning affects the shadows and lighting on the scene below, which is consistent with the angle of sunlight and its effects on landscapes.",
