      "question": "Does the atomic design retain the three intersecting elliptical orbits with a central nucleus and three electron positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cookies depicted feature atomic designs. One design in the middle of the top row and the design on the left in the bottom feature three intersecting elliptical orbits with a central nucleus and electron positions, these are typical for atomic models. In addressing this question, the focus is most likely on the underlying concept of atomic structures based on visual cues and common atomic model representations. Therefore, the question is asking whether a specific atomic design in Image B retains these recognizable features.",

      "question": "Is the white plastic cookie cutter retaining its original atomic-shaped outline with three elliptical loops and a central nucleus?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain the white plastic cookie cutter shown in Image A. In Image A, the cookie cutter is distinct with three elliptical loops and a central nucleus, commonly used for imprinting such atomic designs on dough to create cookies. Image B focuses on cookies and their finished designs rather than the tools used to create them. No reference to a white plastic tool is depicted in Image B itself.",

      "question": "Is the cookie cutter positioned to the left of the atomic imprint, with a partial edge overlap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible cookie cutter or dough imprint. The content of Image B consists entirely of cookies with atomic designs and does not depict the placement of a cookie cutter like in Image A, where the cutter is positioned to the left of an atomic imprint in dough. Without visual evidence of a cutter or imprint in Image B, this specific positioning cannot be addressed.",

      "question": "Does the atomic imprint in the dough have clean, continuous edges without breaks or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of an atomic imprint in dough or any detail regarding the edges of such an imprint. Image B strictly features cookies styled with atomic designs and labeled with playful scientific terms, unlike Image A which shows an imprint in dough with smooth, continuous edges. Therefore, this question does not apply to Image B content.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a small central hole in the nucleus area of the atomic imprint?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not showcase any dough imprints with holes; instead, it presents baked cookies. While some cookie designs displayed in Image B have elements that represent nuclei or centers, the specific design of an imprint with a physical hole, as seen in Image A, is absent.",
