    "Question": "Q1: Is the leaf in the edited image still ovate with a pointed tip and serrated edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf appears to have an ovate shape with a pointed tip, consistent with common knowledge on leaf shapes. The edges seem serrated based on the visible indentations along its sides. Therefore, based on visual observation and typical leaf characteristics, the leaf retains its ovate shape with serrated edges.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the leaf retain the prominent central vein with branching secondary veins forming a network across its surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf clearly shows a central vein running through its length, with secondary veins branching off and forming a visible network pattern. This is characteristic of many leaves where the vein structure is significant. The pattern suggests that the leaf's venation remains detailed and complex.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the leaf retain its papery texture and minor surface imperfections such as blemishes or spots?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the leaf shows visual cues of a papery texture, suggested by the light reflection and fine surface details. Moreover, the blemishes or spots on the leaf's surface are evident, which are common features implying natural leaf wear.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the leaf oriented with the stem pointing toward the upper left and the blade extending diagonally across the frame?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stem of the leaf is pointing toward the upper left of the frame, and the leaf blade extends diagonally across the frame from this point. This orientation of the leaf is well-defined in the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the leaf the sole central object in the edited image, without any other competing elements in the foreground?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while the leaf is the prominent feature, it is enclosed within a glass sphere, which constitutes an additional element in the foreground. This makes the glass sphere an equally significant object that competes with the leaf for attention in the image.",
    "answer": "No"
