      "question": "Is the fallen log still present in the foreground, lying diagonally across the cave floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see an arched structure with crystal spikes and glowing runes, alongside a bright sun-like orb in the background, indicating that it is not depicting a traditional cave scene with natural elements as in Image A. Thus, there is no presence of a fallen log in the foreground. Based on these observations, the answer is derived.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does sunlight still enter from the arch opening and illuminate the right side of the cave interior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arch opens into a bright, glowing orb that resembles a sun, which might emit light. However, this is not sunlight entering in a traditional sense but rather an artificial element in the scene. Therefore, the illumination is not comparable to sunlight entering and illuminating a cave interior.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the rocky, uneven ground surface visible beneath the arch and extending toward the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts an arched structure with a ground surface that appears rocky and uneven, similar to Image A's description. There are rock elements beneath the arch extending forward, consistent with the presence of a rocky surface extending under the arch.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bright sky and distant tree-covered hillside still visible through the arch opening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arch opens into a glowing orb in the background instead of a sky and trees. Therefore, there is no view of a bright sky or hillside with trees. The scene provides a fantastical view rather than a natural landscape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the cave interior structured with converging rock walls and a clear path leading toward the arch opening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure is not a traditional cave but an architectural arch with crystals and runes. There is no depiction of cave walls converging towards the arch opening, only an artistic pathway leading through. Therefore, the structure does not match that of a cave interior.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the surrounding rock walls still composed of layered sedimentary rock with natural weathering patterns and beige-to-brown coloration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a fantastical stone arch with added crystal spikes and engraved runes. The surrounding structure does not show the layered sedimentary rock with weathering patterns typical of natural formations, nor is it in shades of beige-to-brown as seen in Image A.",
