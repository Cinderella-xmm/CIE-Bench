        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we can observe that the dish is still served in a white porcelain bowl with a blue floral design, similar to Image A. This design is distinct and stands out in both images, helping us identify the consistency in the serving ware.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orange curry sauce is clearly visible, coating the transformed elements represented by dragon eggs and surrounded by dragon figurines.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon eggs are centered within the bowl, similar to how the chicken pieces are centered in Image A. However, the addition and placement of dragon figurines on top of the eggs signify a change in arrangement, making the overall layout different from the original. Therefore, the arrangement is not consistent with the original dish's placement.",
