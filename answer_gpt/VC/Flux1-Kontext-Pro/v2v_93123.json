      "question": "Does the elderly man retain his white hair and mustache?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly man is shown with white hair that is voluminous and styled back, which aligns with the typical image of an elderly man with such features. The blurred area does not include the mustache, hence based on visible cues and world knowledge about classic representations of elderly male figures, it is reasonable to maintain the assumption of a white mustache as well.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pineapple retains its distinct features such as the spiky green leaves at the top and the textured golden-brown skin that is typical of pineapples. This is visually identifiable and aligns with common knowledge of the fruit's appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the elderly man still gazing contemplatively toward the pineapple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of the man's head and shoulders suggests that he is facing the direction of the pineapple, which implies a contemplative gaze even though facial features are blurred. This aligns with a typical representation of someone contemplating an object.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image of the elderly man and the pineapple in Image B is set in a warm tone, with soft shadows visible around them, which suggests that the warm lighting and shadows are consistent with those often seen in classical art or staged photographs highlighting texture and color.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spatial arrangement shows the pineapple positioned to the right of the man, which mirrors a classic compositional balance often used in portrait and still-life photography or artwork, maintaining their relative spatial relationship.",
