    "Question": "Q1: Are the characters still depicted as actively skiing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are depicted in dynamic skiing positions. This is indicated by their bent knees, posture, and the fact that they are holding ski poles, suggesting active movement. Skiing typically involves such posture to maintain balance and momentum, which is retained here.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the characters still arranged in a line formation while skiing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are arranged in a line formation as they ski along the path. This is evident from the alignment of their bodies and their positions on the snowy path, a common arrangement to optimize space and maintain a safe distance while skiing.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the characters still hold ski poles and wear skis?",
    "explanation": "The characters in Image B are depicted holding ski poles and wearing skis, which are fundamental components of ski equipment. This indicates their continued engagement in skiing, as these tools are crucial for balance, steering, and propulsion on snow.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there still a visible snowy path beneath the characters?",
    "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a snowy path beneath the characters, which is necessary for skiing. The path is characterized by the even layer of snow and the tracks left by previous skiers, which indicates that the activity is taking place on a designated skiing trail.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the characters still moving forward along the path?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the posture and orientation of the characters suggest forward movement. Their skis are aligned in the direction of the path, and their skiing posture indicates motion along the traditional routes used in cross-country skiing. This implies that they are indeed moving forward along the snowy path.",
    "answer": "Yes"
