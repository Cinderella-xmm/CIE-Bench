    "Question": "Q1: Does the image retain the English Bulldog's tan coat and white facial markings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is a sculpture, and sculptures are typically monochromatic unless painted. From the visual cues, the bulldog is depicted in a solid color, presumably to resemble a stone or plaster statue, without individual color details like tan or white markings. This contrasts with the natural coloration visible in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the English Bulldog still positioned balancing on the skateboard?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bulldog sculpture is positioned on a skateboard, but as a static figure due to its material nature, it cannot be balancing like a live dog would be. It is positioned on the skateboard but in a non-interactive, stationary manner as part of a sculptural display. In contrast, Image A shows the bulldog actively standing on a skateboard in an outdoor environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the skateboard still blue with its original design?",

    "answer": "No"
