      "question": "Is the anvil present with a blocky rectangular base and a pointed horn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the anvil is depicted with a distinct blocky rectangular base supporting a pointed horn, a common design for anvils used in blacksmithing to enable the shaping of various metal objects. Such design provides structural stability while allowing the blacksmith to use the horn for bending metal. This is evidenced by the visible shape and structure of the anvil in the image.",

      "question": "Is there a glowing red-orange metal object resting on the anvil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, a glowing red-orange metal object can be clearly seen resting on the anvil. This glow indicates that the metal is heated to a high temperature, typical in blacksmithing where metals are heated to be malleable for shaping and forging.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hammer positioned above or in contact with the glowing metal on the anvil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer is in contact with the glowing red-orange metal on the anvil, suggesting that the blacksmith is in the process of striking the metal. This is a typical action in metalworking to shape or flatten the metal while it is hot.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows tongs held in the blacksmith’s left hand, which grip the glowing red-orange metal on the anvil. Tongs are commonly used in blacksmithing to hold and manipulate hot metal securely while work is being done with the other hand.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the anvil is placed on top of a circular wooden stump. This setup is traditional, as it provides a stable surface that absorbs shock and gives the blacksmith optimal height and leverage for working the metal on the anvil.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a stone furnace to the right with a glowing interior, indicating it is actively used in heating metal. The glow suggests high temperatures necessary for making metals pliable, which is essential in blacksmithing processes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
