      "question": "Is the capybara’s snout broad and flat with a rounded muzzle, consistent with its real-world anatomy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the visual structure of the capybara's snout appears to be slightly altered due to the artistic representation, but it maintains a broad and flat appearance with a rounded muzzle. This is consistent with real-world capybaras, known for their large, flat noses. Therefore, considering the artistic approach, it aligns with typical anatomy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the capybara’s ears small, rounded, and located high on the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara's ears are positioned high on the head and appear small and rounded. This positioning and size are consistent with real-world capybara anatomy where they have similarly small, rounded ears situated at the top of their head, helping them hear above water when swimming.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the capybara standing upright and facing directly toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The capybara in Image B is depicted wearing attire and standing in a manner resembling human pose rather than a natural capybara pose. It is shown upright, revealing a fashionable style, and facing directly toward the viewer, a deviation from its natural stance but common in artistic depictions where animals are anthropomorphized.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both hands positioned in front of the chest, gripping an object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara's hands are shown positioned in front of its chest, gripping an object, specifically a teacup. This positioning is consistent with an anthropomorphic representation where the character mimics human-like behavior and interactions, holding objects in a manner similar to humans.",
      "weight": 2,

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the capybara’s fur primarily light brown with darker tones around the muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The capybara's fur color in Image B is light brown with darker shading around areas like the collars and the ears. The muzzle, like in real-world capybaras, appears naturally darker to mimic the texture and pattern of an authentic capybara’s fur shading.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the capybara have a stocky, large body with short legs and a thick torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the capybara is dressed in vintage attire and its body is partially obscured, the general shape appears to align with the capybara’s typical anatomy. It seems stocky and large-bodied, a characteristic feature of capybaras known for their robust build and short legs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the capybara have four limbs visible or implied by posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the given representation in Image B, the posture and characteristic depiction of the capybara do not clearly show four limbs; however, the positioning suggests an anthropomorphized stance, similar to a human standing upright implying the presence of limbs. Therefore, the traditional presentation implies the typical four-limb anatomy.",
