      "question": "Is the sunset visible on the horizon with its reflection on the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunset is clearly visible above the horizon, with a vivid orange glow cast across the scene. The reflection of the sun is authentically depicted on the water, which is a natural effect seen during sunsets due to the light scattering over the water surface. Thus, the combination of visual cues and common knowledge confirms the presence of the sunset and reflection.",

      "question": "Does the sandy beach retain its texture and extend across the bottom of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a sandy beach visible across the lower part of the image, maintaining continuity from left to right. The texture of the sand appears natural and consistent, as evidenced by visible grains and footprints, which are typical features of a sandy shore.",

      "question": "Are the ocean waves present, showing natural movement near the shore?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ocean waves are depicted with natural contours and movement along the shore, which is indicative of typical wave patterns where water moves toward and retreats from a sandy beach. This is consistent with world knowledge of ocean behavior and visually confirms the presence of waves.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the surfboards retain their original colors (yellow on the left, red and teal on the right) and upright positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfboards are upright with one on the right having red and teal stripes and the one on the left being solid yellow. These color patterns match the original surfboards from Image A, showing that their positions and colors remain unchanged.",

      "question": "Are the pandas positioned similarly to the original humans, with one arm holding the surfboard and both facing the sunset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pandas are positioned similarly to the human figures from Image A. They are standing upright, each holding a surfboard with one arm while facing the sunset. The posture and arm placement reflect that of a person standing by the shore ready to surf.",
