      "question": "Is there a river running down the center of the image from the foreground to the distant mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visually, there is a body of water that runs from the foreground of the image up towards the mountains in the background. This is consistent with the common depiction of a river in landscape art, where the water forms a central element leading the viewer's eye into the distance. Such rivers often flow through valleys, as depicted here with surrounding trees and mountains.",
