      "question": "Is the horse depicted with its original white coat and blonde mane and tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is observed to have a white coat along with a blonde mane and tail. These color features are typical for horses and indicate that no alterations in color have been made to the coat or mane and tail. In Image A, the horse also displays a white coat and blonde mane and tail. Considering the attributes remain consistent between the two images, the horse retains its original appearance in terms of color.",

      "question": "Does the horse retain its posture of being in mid-gait?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals the horse is captured in mid-gait, with its foreleg stretched forward and its opposite hind leg extended backward, indicating movement typically seen in mid-stride. Image A also shows a horse in mid-gait with similar leg positioning. Since both images suggest dynamic movement with the horse captured mid-step, the posture and gait remain unchanged.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the horseâ€™s hooves clearly, giving a natural look without any apparent modifications. The hooves appear consistent with typical horse anatomy and exhibit no unnatural alterations. In Image A, the hooves also seem unaltered. Thus, based on appearance and consistency with standard horse anatomy, the hooves have not been changed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, an examination of the horse's proportions indicates typical horse anatomy with no noticeable distortion of proportions. The muscular build, leg lengths, and body size appear appropriate for a healthy horse. Image A shows similar proportions, reinforcing that the body form is consistent across both images, confirming no changes have been made.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's eyes and facial expression seem natural, with a typical forward-facing gaze and passive expression commonly associated with horses. This is unchanged from Image A, where similar attributes are observed, indicating the facial features and expression remain unchanged.",
