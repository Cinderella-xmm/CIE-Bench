    "Question": "Q1: Is the subject's facial expression, including a wide smile showing teeth and eyes looking upward to the left, preserved?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's facial area is blurred, so we cannot determine the details of the facial expression or how the eyes and mouth are positioned. The question of a wide smile showing teeth or the orientation of the eyes cannot be answered given the visual information available.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Is the subject's head turned slightly to the left, maintaining the original angle?",
    "explanation": "The blurred face does not obscure the overall orientation of the head in Image B. Based on the alignment of the hair and the visible portions of the head, it seems the head maintains a similar angle, slightly turned to the left. Situational context and style consistency with traditional portraiture support this as likely consistent behavior.",
    "answer": "Yes"
