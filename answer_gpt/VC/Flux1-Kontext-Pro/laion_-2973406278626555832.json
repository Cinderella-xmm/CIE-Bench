    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the transparent tank section of the vape device clearly visible, allowing the internal liquid to be seen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the diagram explicitly shows the tank section of the vape device with annotations detailing the position and content of internal components like liquid and coil. This presentation implies that the liquid and coil are intended to be visible for understanding the device's function. No visual obstructions or concealments are noted in the transparent tank section.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the black mouthpiece and cap at the top of the vape device present and correctly positioned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B visually illustrates the black mouthpiece and cap clearly located at the top part of the device, as demonstrated in the top drawing, through a straightforward depiction meant for explanatory purposes. These components appear to be correctly positioned based on conventional designs of such devices.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the coil component located at the base of the device, visible through the transparent tank?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the coil component is portrayed through a cutaway diagram, where the coil is visibly nested within the structure but not specifically indicated at the base. According to common e-cigarette designs, the coil is typically on top or integrated within the tank section above the battery, as reflected in the drawing.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the liquid inside the transparent tank clearly visible and present at a measurable level?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates the presence of a liquid within the device, as highlighted by the diagram showing a liquid level in proximity to the coil. The annotation indicates its position for comprehension purposes, confirming its visibility and measurable presence within the tank.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the internal components (coil, liquid, battery) arranged in a logically consistent vertical alignment within the device?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the diagram displays a vertical schematic where the coil, liquid, and battery are aligned in a representation that conveys an internal arrangement. This vertical layout is typical for devices of this nature to ensure efficient functional performance, as shown.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is an airflow pathway indicated or implied in the deviceâ€™s structure, such as an inlet near the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B incorporates annotations and features that suggest an airflow pathway is a component of the device architecture, revealing an implied inlet near the base in the diagram that corresponds with common designs of vaping devices, necessary for functionality.",
