      "question": "Is the pink flamingo-shaped mug with a white beak and curved neck present in the same position relative to the cereal bars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pink flamingo-shaped mug with a white beak and curved neck is positioned closely behind the cereal bars, just like in Image A. By referring to the position and orientation of the mug in both images, along with the arrangement of the cereal bars in the foreground, it can be determined that the mug retains its relative position to the cereal bars in both images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the words \"freee\" and \"corn flakes\" visible on the cereal box, along with the bird logo above the brand name?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'freee' and 'corn flakes' are clearly visible on the cereal box on the right side, positioned near the top, with the bird logo shown above the brand name. This is verifiable upon close inspection, as these design elements are intended to indicate the branding and product type and are seen in both images.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the circular illustration of a bowl filled with corn flakes visible on the front of the cereal box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, we see a circular illustration on the front of the cereal box displaying a bowl filled with corn flakes. This is consistent with typical cereal box designs where product depiction is included and is re-confirmed by checking Image A, where this imagery remains visible.",

      "question": "Is the light-colored wooden surface visible beneath the cereal bars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface beneath the cereal bars is not a light-colored wooden surface as seen in Image A, but a cartoonish environment that resembles a table. Through direct visual comparison, it is clear that the wooden texture has been replaced with a simpler, animated style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In analyzing Image B, the off-white wall present in Image A is replaced with a cartoonish outdoor background featuring blue skies and clouds. This substitution alters the entire background setting from a plain wall to a vivid scenic illustration.",

      "choices": [

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pink flamingo mug's position mirrors its placement from Image A, positioned behind and slightly to the left of the cereal bars. By identifying the spatial arrangement within the frame, it's clear that the mug's location remains consistent across both images.",
