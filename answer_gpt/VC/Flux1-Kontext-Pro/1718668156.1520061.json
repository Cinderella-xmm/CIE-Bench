      "question": "Is the amber-colored liquid visible in the short glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the short glass contains a liquid that appears to be consistent with the appearance of an amber color. The color is visually warm and resembles what is commonly perceived as amber, likely due to light reflections and the dispersion through ice. Common sense indicates that this color, combined with the visual transparency and the context of a glass with ice, suggests a liquid, possibly a drink with amber-like properties.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a straw protruding from the short glass that is distinctly yellow in color. The positioning from the glass indicates an insertion typical of a use in drinking vessels. The introduction of this straw matches with the common function associated with straws for sipping beverages.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual details in Image B show ice cubes within the short glass. The ice is visually clear and angular, similar to how ice cubes typically appear when submerged in liquid. The combination of the physical look and context suggests the presence of ice cubes in the glass.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tall glass showcases a pattern of ice from top to bottom in a consistent manner, giving the appearance of being entirely filled with ice. The clarity and quantity collectively suggest there are no visible voids or spaces unoccupied by ice within the glass.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B contains a distinctive architectural feature resembling the sail-like shells of the Sydney Opera House. These structures are recognizable due to their iconic design and are often perceived as representative of this landmark in visual references. The features resemble the concert hall's iconic sails, indicating the structure's likeness to Sydney Opera House.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible stone ledge beneath the glasses; instead, the glasses appear to be situated on a surface consistent with a digital, sci-fi-like theme. The lack of any earthy or stone-like texture indicates that the traditional ledge is not present here. The surface appears digitalized rather than natural stone.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two glasses are positioned side by side with the short glass on the left and the tall glass on the right. The spatial arrangement and orientation reflect this side-by-side alignment, as opposed to being arranged in any other order on the surface depicted in the image.",
