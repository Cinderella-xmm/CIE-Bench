      "question": "Is the astronaut's face visible through a clear, circular helmet visor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the astronaut's face is blurred, but it is visible through a helmet that has a clear visor, suggesting the typical helmet design with a circular opening. The covering is clear as it shows the features behind it, thus confirming its transparency.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an American flag patch visible on the left shoulder of the astronaut's suit. The patch features the colors red, white, and blue associated with the American flag, confirming its presence and typical color scheme for such patches.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visible behind the astronaut, there is a large, boxy structure which is indicative of a life-support pack. This type of equipment is typically depicted with astronauts to provide necessary support systems during spacewalks.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the astronaut's suit with segmented joints visible at the elbows and knees. These segments are usually included in spacesuit designs to allow for mobility in the arm and leg regions.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a depiction of dust or impact marks beneath the astronaut's right boot, suggesting that movement on the lunar surface is causing these effects, a common portrayal in lunar explorations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a large bright sphere in the background sky, which, given the context of space and lunar imagery, can be interpreted as representing a celestial body, potentially the Earth, visible from the Moon. However, it is depicted as more luminous than typical Earth renderings.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The helmet in Image B is illustrated as a smooth, circular dome, which is traditional for astronaut helmets. Its smooth surface implies reflectivity, even if not overtly shown as such, in accordance with standard designs.",
