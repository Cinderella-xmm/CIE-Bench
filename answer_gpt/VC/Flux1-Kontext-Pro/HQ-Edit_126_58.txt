    "Question": "Q1: Is the neck of the swan-shaped object still curved in an elegant S-shape, extending upward and backward from the body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object is no longer a swan but rather a perfume bottle labeled 'Winter Glow.' The neck of the swan-shaped object is not visible because it has been replaced by the neck of the bottle, which is vertical and cylindrical. Based on this observation, the original elegant S-shaped curvature of the swan's neck is no longer present.",
