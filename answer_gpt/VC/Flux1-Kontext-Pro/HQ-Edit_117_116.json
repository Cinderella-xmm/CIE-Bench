    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the pink-red feathery flower clusters present in both the foreground and background, positioned on slender green stems?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pink-red feathery flower clusters are clearly visible both in the foreground and background. They are positioned on slender green stems, which are common characteristics of such flowers in nature. This conclusion is drawn from the observation of visual cues where these clusters are noticeable across different depths of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a clear, symmetrical reflection of the dragonfly visible on the water surface directly beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragonfly's reflection is visibly symmetrical and clear on the water surface beneath it. This assessment is based on the visual representation of the reflection, which mirrors the dragonfly's form in a balanced and direct manner, indicating a typical reflective surface interaction.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the water surface calm and reflective, with small sparkling particles scattered across it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a calm and reflective water surface, as evident from the clear reflection of the dragonfly observed. The scattering of small sparkling particles is visible across this surface, suggesting the presence of light interactions. This understanding stems from the clear visual indicators of reflection and sparkle.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the dragonfly hovering just above the water surface, with its body parallel to the water plane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragonfly appears to be hovering just above the water surface with a visible parallel orientation to the water plane. This analysis is derived from observing the dragonfly's reflection alignment and distance from the water, indicating its close proximity and parallel orientation to the surface.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a bright, diffused light source in the upper center of the image, casting a golden glow through the green foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a bright, diffused light source in the upper center, casting a golden glow throughout the green foliage. This is evident from the visible color gradient and diffusion in that area, suggesting sunlight filtering through the leaves, a common scene in natural settings.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there slender green stems and leafy structures extending from the water, supporting the pink-red flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pink-red flowers are clearly supported by slender green stems and leafy structures that extend from near the water surface. This observation is made from the positioning and orientation of the stems and leaves, which are typical of plants growing near or in water bodies.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the background composed of blurred green foliage with visible patches of sunlight filtering through?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background of blurred green foliage with distinct patches of sunlight filtering through. This conclusion is drawn from the observation of varying light intensities and diffuseness, indicating sunlight permeating through the leaves, consistent with natural lighting conditions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
