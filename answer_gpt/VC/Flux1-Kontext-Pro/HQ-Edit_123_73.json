    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the original grayish stone texture of the pyramid’s surface retained, including visible weathering and erosion patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image reveals the pyramid’s usual stone texture, but it’s overlaid with more intricate designs, including a dragon-like creature covering a large part of the surface. The weathering and erosion patterns typically seen on ancient stone structures are obscured by these new designs, suggesting significant edits to the original surface texture.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the top platform of the pyramid preserved as a flat, rectangular structure with defined edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the top of the pyramid is transformed into the head of a dragon, deviating substantially from the original flat, rectangular design with sharp edges. This change implies the original structure was not preserved in its edit.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the central staircase remain aligned along the front face of the pyramid, extending from the top temple to the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The staircase in the edited image does align along the front face of the pyramid, extending downward as seen in the traditional architectural style of such pyramids, indicating its retention.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there exactly nine distinct tiers visible in the pyramid’s structure, decreasing in size from bottom to top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image appears to show fewer than nine tiers due to the dragon overlay, which distracts attention from counting the tiers accurately. Thus, the distinct tier count seems altered in the edit.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are patches of moss and small vegetation visible along the edges and steps of the pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited pyramid is adorned with a creative overlay that resembles a dragon, which might include elements that can be mistaken for vegetation. However, typical patches of moss and small vegetation along the edges and steps don't visibly appear unchanged.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the shadow cast by the pyramid positioned to the lower right, consistent with sunlight coming from the upper left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the shadow direction in the edited image shows that the shadow extends to the upper right instead of the lower right, which is inconsistent with the expected direction based on sunlight coming from the upper left.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the pyramid located in the center of a dense tropical jungle, with trees surrounding it on all sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the surrounding environment appears consistent with a dense tropical jungle, characterized by abundant greenery and canopy indicative of such an ecosystem. Thus, the jungle setting is retained.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the top platform of the pyramid covered with dry soil and patches of moss, indicating natural overgrowth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts the top of the pyramid as part of a dragon’s head, removing the platform’s natural details such as dry soil and moss growth, implying they are not visible in their original form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Are there multiple white vehicles parked on the grassy area near the base of the pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not present any vehicles parked near the pyramid due to the overlay of the dragon and lack of other modern elements that tend to surround such sites, indicating the absence of vehicles.",
      "weight": 1,
