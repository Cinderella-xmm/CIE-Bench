      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard's shape retains its defining features: it is elongated and rectangular with rounded ends.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sink is visible and maintains its oval shape as seen in the design of many modern sinks. Its placement on the countertop remains unchanged from its typical position in a kitchen setting, sitting below a faucet.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden cabinets are present with a similar structural appearance as in traditional kitchen setups, characterized by their rectangular shapes and arrangements with handles in the expected positions, indicating that they are of wooden material and their arrangement is retained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard maintains a position leaning against the cabinets from an angle I observe as consistent with resting across the cabinet doors. This characteristic position is common for temporarily storing skateboards in tight spaces, indicating consistent placement.",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B artfully alters the tiles, transforming their coloration and patterns into a more vivid mosaic-like presentation compared to the plain beige and white patterns seen in Image A. Thus, the original tile patterns have not been retained.",
