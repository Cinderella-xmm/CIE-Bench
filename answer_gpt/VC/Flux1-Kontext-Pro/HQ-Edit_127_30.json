      "question": "Are the two symmetrical f-hole shapes present on the body of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object, which resembles a violin based on common violin features, displays two symmetrical f-holes on the top surface of its body. F-holes are typical sound holes on stringed instruments like violins, often paired and mirrored on either side of the bridge area. This visual cue combined with the recognized design of violins confirms the presence of these features.",

      "question": "Is the scroll with four tuning pegs located at the top end of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visual cues in Image B show that the object has a scroll at the end of its neck, with tuning pegs incorporated into it. This combination of features is typical for violins, where the scroll is often carved and can host the tuning pegs on its sides. The placement and detailing observed corresponds to this standard violin design, confirming the presence of a scroll with four tuning pegs.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the object retain the classic violin silhouette with distinct upper and lower bouts and a central waist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object features a classic violin silhouette, characterized by its curved shape with distinct upper and lower bouts and a narrower central waist. This design is typical of violins and is easily identified by this form, which accommodates the acoustics required for sound projection. The visual cues, such as the curvature and proportions, match widely recognized violin silhouettes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a clearly defined bridge area located between the two f-holes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the object with a bridge area situated between the two f-holes, visible through the raised section accommodating strings connected from the tailpiece to the scroll. On violins, the bridge is a critical part where strings span across, influencing sound production. The placement and structure are clearly represented in the image, aligning with conventional violin design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the object positioned diagonally across the support surface, with the scroll pointing toward the upper right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the violin is oriented diagonally across the table upon which its case rests. The scroll at the top end of the neck is observed to point toward the upper right corner of the image frame. The angle and positioning are evident through the alignment of the case and violin, confirming the stated orientation.",
