    "Question": "Q1: Is the subject seated upright with the back supported by a chair?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is visibly seated in a chair, as evidenced by the presence of a wooden armrest partially visible on the left side of the image. The posture appears to be proper, suggesting an upright seating position consistent with someone sitting comfortably in a supportive chair. Such posture is typical for engaging in activities like writing or reading, as depicted here.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the hands positioned together on the lap?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hands are not positioned together on the lap. Instead, the right hand is holding a pen or stylus and is actively engaged in writing, while the left hand is positioned on the open book, likely to steady the pages. This hand positioning indicates active involvement in writing rather than simply resting them on the lap.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the head positioned directly above the torso and centered in the frame?",
    "explanation": "The edited image shows the subject's head directly above the torso, maintaining anatomical alignment with the body. The frame captures the subject's upper body and head symmetrically, indicating the head is centered vertically onto the torso. The same alignment is consistent in portraiture where subjects appear composed and formal.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a visible armrest beneath the subject’s right hand?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, an armrest is indeed visible beneath the subject’s left hand (on the right side of the viewer). However, the writing posture and angle suggest this armrest supports a proportion of the arm, typical for maintaining balance when seated in a chair that includes such features.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the arms bent at the elbows and resting along the sides of the body?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the subject's arms are bent at the elbows, but they are not resting passively along the sides of the body. The right arm is engaged in writing, while the left arm steadies the book. The artistic depiction suggests active use rather than resting posture.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the legs positioned symmetrically beneath the torso?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, although the full view of the legs is not visible, the available visual cues focus on the upper body. The posture appears to be symmetrical based on the centered torso and the consistent position of the arms, which implies a likely symmetrical position of the legs beneath the torso, as is typical in seated portraits.",
    "answer": "Yes"
