      "question": "Are the long, upward-curving horns of the cow present and retaining their original shape and position on the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horns are prominently featured on the head of the hybrid figure. The horns are correctly shaped, long, and curve upward, similar to those in Image A, maintaining their original position. This suggests that the edited image preserved the horns' characteristics from the cow in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hybrid figure has a head with reddish-brown shaggy fur that closely resembles the cow’s fur seen in Image A. This fur covers the head and shoulders of the hybrid figure, indicating consistency with the cow's original appearance.",

      "question": "Is the white lab coat visible on the upper body of the hybrid figure, including the lapels, pockets, and full length down to the waist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the hybrid figure wearing a white lab coat. The coat includes visible features such as the lapels, pockets, and extends the full length down to the waist, aligning with what is visible on the man in Image A. This confirms the presence of the lab coat.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the hybrid figure wearing brown trousers and black dress shoes, similar to the attire seen on the man in Image A. However, the figure is standing rather than in a walking motion. The trousers and shoes match in both images, but the positioning differs.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the hybrid figure standing with both feet on the ground, which contrasts with Image A, where the man is captured mid-stride with the right leg lifted. This indicates a difference in posture.",
