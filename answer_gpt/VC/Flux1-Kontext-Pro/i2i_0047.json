      "question": "Is the train still primarily painted in blue-purple with a yellow front and red doors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a train that maintains its blue-purple body with a yellow front and red doors. This color scheme is consistent with the common design used by many trains and matches the typical palette used for rail transport visibility. Despite the change in lighting and surroundings, the primary color characteristics remain apparent.",

      "question": "Are the windows and doors on the train still arranged in their original positions and shapes as seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train's windows and doors are visible and appear to be in the same positions and shapes as in the original image. The unchanged arrangement suggests a standard design for these elements to ensure functionality and ease of access, which does not seem to have been altered in the edited environment.",

      "question": "Does the train remain connected to the railway tracks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the train on railway tracks, indicating its connection to a network that allows it to travel. While the setting has shifted to a more urban and neon-lit environment, the train still rests on tracks, maintaining its capability to move over such infrastructure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The train wheels in Image B are visible under the carriages, maintaining their original structure. The wheels are a fundamental part of the train's design, allowing it to navigate the tracks properly. Despite the edited setting, the essential structural aspect of the train remains unchanged.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks visible infrastructure elements such as bridges or platforms surrounding the train. The new background is composed of urban buildings and neon lights without signs of typical railway infrastructure seen in Image A. This alteration indicates a shift to a more imaginative and possibly futuristic scenery.",
