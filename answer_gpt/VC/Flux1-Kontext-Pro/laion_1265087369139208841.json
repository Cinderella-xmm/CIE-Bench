      "question": "Are the two cylindrical corner towers still present at the left and right ends of the castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a castle encased within a glass orb. At either end of the castle's facade, there are cylindrical towers, one on the left and another on the right, which are similar to those seen in historical castles. By matching this observation with common architectural styles, these towers are likely the same cylindrical corner towers as found on castles such as those in medieval Europe.",

      "question": "Do the two central square turrets with pointed finials remain atop the central section of the castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two square turrets at the central section of the castle. Both turrets have pointed finials, frequently used in gothic and medieval architecture as decorative elements atop towers and roofs. The presence and positioning of these elements match typical features found in castle architecture and align with their appearance in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the large central arched entranceway still present and centrally aligned with the pathway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the castle exhibits a large central arched entranceway which aligns with the pathway leading toward it, just as observed in Image A. This alignment is typical in castle designs to welcome visitors and create a defined focal point along the approach, emphasizing symmetry.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the arched windows and openings arranged symmetrically across the front facade of the castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays arched windows and openings across the front facade of the castle. Upon inspecting the image, these features appear symmetrically balanced from side to side in both the edited and original images. Symmetry in architecture contributes to aesthetic balance and is commonly employed in historical castle designs.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the castle still constructed from dark gray and reddish-brown stone blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the castle is depicted within a glass orb with visible stone construction. The colors observed are consistent with dark gray and reddish-brown tones typically seen in natural stone used in castle architecture. These colors are also seen in Image A, indicating that the material is unchanged.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the upper portion of the castle still open to the sky, revealing the lack of a roof and internal framework?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the castle's upper section appears exposed without a roof, similar to the ruinous state in Image A. The lack of a roof and internal framework is typical in ruins, offering historical insight into the possible abandonment or deterioration over time.",
      "weight": 2,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a gravel pathway leading directly to a large central arched entranceway, which also aligns with the pathway in Image A. This configuration is intentional to guide visitors directly into the heart of the structure, ensuring coordinated design elements.",
