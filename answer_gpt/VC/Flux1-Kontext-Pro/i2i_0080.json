        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, on both the left side and back views, the dog’s fur appears to be consistent in color, presenting the same reddish-brown hue. This consistency is a sign that the editor maintained the fur color in both views.",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog wears a red collar with a tag in the left side view and from the back view, the collar is visible but the tag does not appear.
