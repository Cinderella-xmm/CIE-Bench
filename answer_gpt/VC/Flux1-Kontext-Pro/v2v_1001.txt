    "Question": "Q1: Is the dinosaur depicted with its long neck extended and standing in the water?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dinosaur is not visible. Instead, the focus is on the lettering 'The King of Flavors' and a bottle standing in the water. Based on common sense, if an object was replaced by text and another object, the original feature is no longer present. Therefore, the dinosaur in Image A has been replaced in Image B.",
