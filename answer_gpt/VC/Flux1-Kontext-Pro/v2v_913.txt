    "Question": "Q1: Does the cake retain its two distinct layers of dark chocolate sponge?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cake is depicted with two distinct horizontal layers of dark chocolate sponge, separated by a layer of chocolate filling. This design is typical for a layered cake and is evident by the clear delineation between the sponge and the filling. The visual cues show a consistent texture and color indicative of chocolate cakes, which usually have such layers to provide a rich taste experience. Thus, these details confirm the retention of two distinct layers.",
