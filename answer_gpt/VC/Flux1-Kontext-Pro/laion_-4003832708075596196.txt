    "Question": "Q1: Are all leaf-shaped elements in the image, including those used as heads, clearly five-pointed maple leaves?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf-shaped elements depicted in the illustration include both tree leaves and the heads of the two characters. The leaves have a signature maple leaf look with multiple points, typically around five to seven, common to maple leaves. The heads of the characters also mimic the shape of a maple leaf with multiple points. Even though they serve a different function, they maintain the same characteristic shape as the other leaves on the tree, suggesting that all leaf elements are five-pointed maple leaves.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are all leaf elements rendered exclusively in shades of orange, yellow, and red?",

Each leaf in the illustration, whether forming part of the tree or designed as part of the character's heads, follows this color scheme, representing the vivid and colorful foliage seen in fall. Thus, all leaf elements adhere to these shades.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the central illustration positioned centrally within the card, bounded by the rectangular frame?",
