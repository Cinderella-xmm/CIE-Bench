        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flag is visibly located at the top of the tallest spire. This spire is central and dominates the structure, consistent with a design where a flag would be placed for prominence. Such architectural placement is typical for emphasis and visibility.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a central entrance with a single ornate staircase that spirals symmetrically from the front entrance upward.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandcastle appears to have a symmetrical design, with features like towers and staircases evenly distributed on either side of the central axis. This symmetry is a common architectural style for balance and aesthetic.",
