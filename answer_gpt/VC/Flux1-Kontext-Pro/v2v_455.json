      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the character wearing a rust-orange jacket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, multiple chibi figures are depicted wearing jackets that visually bear a close resemblance to rust-orange or an orange-brown hue. Familiarity with color terminology allows for this deduction since 'rust-orange' implies an earthy, reddish-orange tint which aligns with what is shown.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the snowboard positioned under the character’s feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image B, each chibi illustration clearly demonstrates the character standing on snowboards, with their feet placed securely on top. This is evident from the drawn positioning and alignment relative to the character's stance.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the character wear a black helmet with red-tinted goggles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in image B appears to have a black helmet present in every depiction. However, none of these illustrations show red-tinted goggles; goggles are not visible on most figures.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the character have long brown hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each chibi character in Image B shows long hair flowing outside the helmet, which appears brown. This observation combines visual identification with knowledge that brown hair displays a darker, earthy hue.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the character’s pants black?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pants worn by the character in each of the illustrations are indeed black. This can be concluded from the visibility of the pants and their agreement with typical descriptions of black clothing as starkly dark.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the character fully visible in the image, with no body parts cut off?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi representations in Image B display complete characters where their bodies, snowboards, and equipment are entirely visible in the depiction and not cut off at the image edges.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question": "Does the character wear black gloves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Similar to the pants, Image B illustrations depict each character wearing gloves that are uniformly black, discernible from their consonance with the shade of the pants and helmet as they appear distinctly dark.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there snow-covered evergreen trees in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visual analysis of Image B shows no background details like trees; the focus remains solely on character illustrations within a simple design backdrop, contrary to the expected detail of snow-covered evergreens, indicating the absence.",
