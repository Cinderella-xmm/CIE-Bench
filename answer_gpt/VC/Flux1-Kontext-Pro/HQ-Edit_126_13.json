        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a drawing features a teapot with a similar shape and handle present on the left side of the table.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drawing also includes a tea bowl situated to the right of the teapot on a rectangular base, suggesting the representation of a dark liquid without visually depicting it given the illustration style. This matches the placement and description from Image A.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
