    "Question": "Q1: Are there exactly three chairs positioned in a row, facing the bookshelf wall?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no chairs visible facing the bookshelf wall. Instead, the seating arrangement consists of soft-looking, round stool-like structures covered with green moss, which suggest a natural setting rather than traditional chairs. This contrasts with Image A, where there are a series of woven chairs in front of the bookshelf. Therefore, the answer is based on the absence of such chairs in Image B.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are there two hanging pendant lights located above the seating area, one closer to the center and one toward the right edge of the frame?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed two hanging pendant lights above the area where shelves are visible. However, they are positioned amidst a forest setting with lights hanging from tree branches, creating an open and natural atmosphere, rather than the structured interior ceiling seen in Image A. Despite the different environments, the presence of two lights remains consistent.",

However, it is not enclosed within a room but is part of an outdoor forest scene, blending into its natural setting rather than occupying an interior wall.
