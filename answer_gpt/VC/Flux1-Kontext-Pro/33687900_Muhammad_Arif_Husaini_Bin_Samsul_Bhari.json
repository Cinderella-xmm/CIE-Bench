    {

      "question": "Are the bright red flowers in the lower-left foreground still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire scene is blacked out, which means no details are visible, including any bright red flowers that might have been present in the foreground of Image A. Consequently, without these features visible in Image B, the answer is that the bright red flowers are not present.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the large green leaf in the bottom-right corner still visible and in the same position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual examination of Image B reveals it is completely blacked out. Given this, the large green leaf from the bottom-right corner of Image A is not visible in Image B, indicating that it is not present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, it is entirely black, making it impossible to see any details including palm-like fronds or fan-shaped leaves that were on the right side of the waterfall in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the moss-covered rock formation visible at the top of the waterfallâ€™s origin point?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks any visible detail due to the blacked-out nature of the edit. Thus, no moss-covered rock formation that might be seen in Image A at the top of the waterfall is visible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B is entirely black and shows no discernible features, the dense tropical vegetation framing the waterfall scene in Image A is no longer visible in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the pool area at the base of the waterfall still located in the same position, even if its appearance has changed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is fully blacked out, providing no discernible visuals, and thus the pool at the base of the waterfall that would be seen in Image A is not visible in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
