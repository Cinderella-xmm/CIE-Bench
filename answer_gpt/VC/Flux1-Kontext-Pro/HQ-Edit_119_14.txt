    "Question": "Q1: Is the full white beard present on the figureâ€™s face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible full white beard beneath the blurred area, typical of a gentleman's style in historical portraiture. The beard is well-groomed and forms a prominent part of the figure's appearance. The presence of the beard is clear from the contrast with the darker suit and the historical style of the whole attire, indicating it is an intentional and distinguishable feature.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is there a red or dark tilak mark positioned between the eyebrows on the forehead?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible mark such as a tilak that is positioned between the eyebrows or on the forehead. The overall presentation and attire are more in line with Western historical fashion, particularly with the top hat, and do not feature elements typical of Indian cultural attire that might include a tilak.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is the figure displaying an open-mouthed smile showing teeth?",
    "explanation": "Image B suggests a face that is more formal and dignified, consistent with a classic or portrait style where a more closed or neutral mouth expression is typical. Given the style and formal attire, an open-mouthed smile would be uncharacteristic and thus is absent.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Is the figure standing upright with arms relaxed at the sides?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is posed with a slight angle and has one hand positioned slightly forward, likely resting on an object or within a coat, which is a common pose in historical portraits to convey authority or sophistication.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the figure shown in full-body view and centered in the frame?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents the figure in a three-quarter or half-body view, which is customary for classical portraiture that focuses on the upper half to convey personality and attire detail rather than a full-body composition.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
