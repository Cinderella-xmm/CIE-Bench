      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the V-shaped dual-wing silhouette of the building preserved in the edited version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a large humanoid robot structure rather than a building. Therefore, the V-shaped dual-wing silhouette characteristic of the building structure in Image A is absent in Image B. The robot does not feature any architectural design that could be reminiscent of a dual-wing silhouette.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floors stacked in a consistent, repeating modular pattern from bottom to top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, which depicts a detailed robotic entity, does not exhibit floors in a building pattern. Instead, its design involves mechanical and structural elements typical of robots, without a modular pattern that resembles stacked floors.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the windows and balconies aligned horizontally on each floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks building elements such as windows and balconies because it is dominated by a humanoid robot. Therefore, there is no alignment of windows and balconies as the image does not portray a building.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the two wings of the building symmetrically positioned relative to the central vertical axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no building structure with wings. Instead, it's a robot with limbs that are distinctive in design due to its mechanical nature. Consequently, there is no symmetrical wing configuration to consider.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the yellow awnings present on the balconies in their original positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the yellow awnings found in Image A on the buildingâ€™s balconies do not exist, as the image has been edited to show a robot instead of a building.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a visible separation between the window openings and the projecting balcony overhangs on each floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no window openings or balcony overhangs seen in Image B since the focus of the image is on a giant robot, not a building. The robot does not have features that resemble architectural elements of floors.",
