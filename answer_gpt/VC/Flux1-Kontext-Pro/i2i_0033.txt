    "Question": "Q1: Does the illustration retain the man's original face shape and glasses?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the manâ€™s general body shape and attire are depicted cartoonishly, with vibrant lines and swooping dynamic motions surrounding him. His face shape and glasses, however, are obscured due to the editing. Since the question refers indirectly to the face shape and glasses, without needing detailed visibility, they were not verifiable. In such circumstances, the answer relies on assessing whether any suggestion of facial features is depicted, but in this scenario, there are none clear enough to evaluate accurately.",
