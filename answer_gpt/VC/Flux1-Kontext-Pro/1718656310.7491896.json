      "question": "Does the edited image retain the original woman's facial structure, including the shape of her eyes, nose, and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's face is blurred and therefore does not allow us to analyze or compare her facial structure, including the shape of her eyes, nose, and mouth with Image A. Given that we cannot make this visual comparison or recognize any specific features, we can conclude that the facial structure details are not retained for analysis in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the woman's hair still auburn in color, curly in texture, and short in length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's hair appears to be of a similar color, auburn, and maintains a curly texture and short length. This assessment is based on the visible hair structure and color in Image B, which matches common descriptions of auburn curly hair. Therefore, the hair attributes remain unchanged.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the woman still seated in a cross-legged position with her arms resting on her knees?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's position has changed from Image A. Instead of sitting cross-legged, she is now sitting with her legs together and hands resting on a surface beside her. This is evident from the visual cues indicating the position of her legs and arms. Hence, her seating position in the edited image is altered.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is wearing a small pendant necklace, which is clearly visible at her collarbone. This visual cue indicates that this accessory remains prominent in its usual location at the collarbone similar to Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the subject is observed sitting on a surface that appears to be covered in moss. This conclusion is drawn from the visible texture and coloration in Image B, which corresponds to the characteristics typically associated with moss.",
