        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image depicts an elephant with noticeable large ears, which are pink inside, giving it the characteristic look of a cartoonish baby elephant, similar to Dumbo. The trunk is also prominently shaped, resembling the typical structure of an elephant's trunk. These attributes are visually evident, indicating that the edited image maintains these key features of an elephant.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is depicted with a yellow hat that sits right on top of its head. Additionally, there is a distinctly visible ruffled collar around its neck, which is colored yellow with a red edge. These accessories are clear in the visual design, reinforcing that they are included in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image clearly shows the elephant with large, prominent black eyes that give it a cute, toy-like appearance. This feature stands out against the grey face of the elephant, making it easy to identify and confirm.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is positioned with its body and face directed towards the viewer, indicating a forward-facing stance. The positioning of the eyes, trunk, and alignment of features all suggest that the elephant is indeed looking straight forward.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image presents the elephant in a soft, plush toy form, which deviates significantly from the rigid, block-based structure of the original model in Image A. The contours are rounder and more lifelike, contrasting with the angular, modular shape of the original Lego-style depiction. This change indicates a clear departure from a block-style aesthetic.",
