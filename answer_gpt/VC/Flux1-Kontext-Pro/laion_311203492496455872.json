      "question": "Is the red circular insignia still present on the left lapel of the suit jacket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red circular insignia is still visible on the left lapel of the suit jacket. Comparing it with Image A, the insignia remains unchanged. Such details are commonly associated with elements of uniform or decoration and are typically affixed to the lapel in a permanent manner.",

      "question": "Is the ear clearly visible on the left side of the head in its original anatomical position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ear is clearly visible on the left side of the head in its original anatomical position. Ear anatomy generally includes the external auricle that is positioned laterally on the head. By comparing with Image A, the position and appearance of the ear remain consistent.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the mouth open in a natural smile showing the upper row of teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, details of the facial expression, particularly around the mouth, are not visible due to the blurred effect over the face area. Thus, there is no information available to determine if the mouth is open or showing teeth.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the nose retaining its original shape with a distinct bridge and rounded tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the blurred face, it is impossible to assess the shape or structure of the nose, including the bridge and tip, as these details are obscured.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orientation of the head suggests it is turned slightly to the right, in a three-quarter profile view. The visibility of one ear and the side of the neck helps to determine this positioning. In comparison to Image A, the head position is consistent.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a uniformly off-white background without visible textures or objects. This is consistent with Image A, where the same background conditions are observed. A uniform background is often used to focus attention on the subject without distractions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the shadows under the chin and along the jawline soft and consistent with even frontal lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the blurred facial area, the shadows visible under the chin and along the jawline appear soft. This effect is indicative of even frontal lighting, which typically minimizes harsh shadows. Comparing with Image A, the lighting consistency remains similar.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt collar is visibly aligned and appears properly connected to the neck beneath the suit jacket. This is reflected in the consistency of formal attire presentation. Comparison with Image A confirms that there is no significant alteration in this aspect.",
