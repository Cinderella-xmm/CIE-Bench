      "question": "Is the NASA logo clearly visible on the left shoulder of the space suit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the NASA logo on the left shoulder of the space suit is clearly visible, indicating its presence and prominence on the suit. The logo is an important identification mark that is recognizable and stands out against the white suit, a detail that aligns with our knowledge of how NASA suits are often designed for easy recognition.",

      "question": "Are the red trim bands visible on the upper arm and lower leg of the space suit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon examining the space suit, there are visible red trim bands on the upper arm and lower leg. These bands are present as distinct red lines that contrast against the suit's white color, providing a functional and aesthetic detail that helps in distinguishing parts of the suit.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white backpack unit is observable as it protrudes from the back of the space suit. Additionally, the coiled white hoses extending from the backpack down the sides of the suit are evident, as they provide necessary connections for life support and communication, a typical design in space suits.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the helmet visor in a position that suggests it is partially raised, as the astronaut's facial area can be somewhat seen, but note that the image intentionally has a blurred feature applied. This depiction corresponds with scenarios where visors can be adjusted to allow visibility or accommodate communication needs.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut is depicted standing in an upright posture with the orientation of their body facing the right side of the image. This positioning is evident from the alignment of the astronaut’s suit and posture, suggesting a specific directional stance.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hoses from the backpack to the suit are visibly connected at the torso area, indicating their functional aspect in supporting the astronaut’s life systems. This connection is a crucial part of the equipment design knowledgeable for maintaining suit operations in space environments.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
