      "question": "Is the toilet still predominantly white in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toilet is still predominantly white. The color appears consistent across the bowl, seat, lid, and tank. By common standards, a toilet with these visible features mostly covered in white can be considered predominantly white. The visual cues from the image, showing no significant color alteration or added elements that change its primary color, support the conclusion.",

      "question": "Is the toilet lid still open?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toilet lid is observed to be in the upright and open position. This can be identified by the visible inner edge and hinge position of the lid. Without significant alteration in structure or position compared to common toilet designs, it clearly appears open.",

      "question": "Is the flush tank still attached to the wall above the toilet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flush tank is situated directly above the bowl and appears supported by its base and plumbing, but not visibly detached from the wall. However, it is a floor-mounted tank typical of most toilets, rather than a wall-mounted one. It retains the conventional design where the tank extends upwards from the bowl and has no strictly visible mounting to the wall.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the walls and floor around the toilet continue to feature the gray square tiles observed. The pattern and color remain consistent with no variance or different material introduced in this depiction. These tiles cover the surfaces uniformly, indicating they are still the predominant covering.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toilet remains positioned in the corner. It is situated adjacent to two intersecting tiled walls, characteristic of a corner placement. No spatial restructuring or edits move it from its corner-based location, concluding its same positioning.",
