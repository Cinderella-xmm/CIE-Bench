      "question": "Does the realistic cat figure retain the cream-colored body with dark brown points on the ears, face, paws, and tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a cat figurine, which is inspired by a Siamese cat, is visible. Siamese cats are known for their cream-colored bodies and dark points on specific areas such as the ears, face, paws, and tail due to temperature-dependent color variations. The figurine captures these distinctive traits with a cream-colored body and dark brown points in these areas, which is apparent in the visual cues.",

      "question": "Does the realistic cat figure have bright blue eyes with visible reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat figurine has blue eyes, which are typical of Siamese cats, reflecting their genetic predisposition to have striking eye colors. The visual cues show that the eyes are bright blue and have reflective qualities giving them a lifelike appearance.",

      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat figurine on a stand does not have a tail curled around its body nor forming a dark ring underneath. The tail is simply depicted with dark brown coloration but does not perform a wrapping function.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows no wooden windowsill. The figurine is placed on a wooden table, which does have a warm brown tone, but it does not have horizontal planks or function as a windowsill. Visual cues show smooth uninterrupted wood surface, typical of tables.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the cat figurine and its packaging, but there is no presence of a ceramic vase with flowers, which in Image A was a stylistic element highlighting household decoration. Image B lacks this specific decorative element.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat figurine exhibits smooth fur with shaded textures intended to replicate the natural gradients of a cat's fur. Though it is a figurine, the design aims to mimic the realistic softness and texture seen in cats, visible through detailed shading and painted textures.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the environment visible in Image A—such as window frame and outdoor landscape—is absent. The background consists of a plain backdrop with focus solely on the cat figurine and its packaging, a typical approach for product presentation without external scenery.",
