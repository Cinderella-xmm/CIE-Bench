    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the surfboard depicted with an elongated oval shape and a central stringer running along its length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfboard is shown inside the snow globe. The board has a typical rounded and elongated oval shape. There is no visible central line or stringer as the view is obscured, indicating a lack of detail that would display such features, especially given the stylized depiction within the snow globe.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a small white wax block being held by the right hand and applied to the surface of the surfboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, again depicted inside the snow globe, the figure's hand seems to be holding a small object towards the surfboard's surface between the fingers, which is consistent with the action of applying wax to a surfboard.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the right hand positioned so that the fingers are gripping the wax block and making direct contact with the surfboard’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the right hand holding an object that looks like a wax block, and is positioned close to the surfboard’s surface at an angle typical for waxing, although the snow globe’s stylization might not show direct contact clearly.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the left hand placed flat on the surfboard, parallel to the board’s surface, providing support?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left hand appears to be positioned on the surfboard in a manner suggesting it is resting on the surface for support, although the perspective may make exact positioning difficult to discern perfectly because of the miniature snow globe representation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the surfboard’s surface show a granular, textured pattern consistent with wax application?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a detailed depiction within the snow globe where the surfboard’s surface in the scene shows a texture that could suggest wax application. However, it’s less definitive than in a close-up original photograph due to the stylized nature of the snow globe depiction.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the figure positioned in a crouched, forward-leaning posture with knees bent and upper body angled over the surfboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is in a forward-leaning posture with bent knees and an angled upper body, consistent with a typical position for applying wax to a surfboard, even though stylized within the snow globe setting.",
