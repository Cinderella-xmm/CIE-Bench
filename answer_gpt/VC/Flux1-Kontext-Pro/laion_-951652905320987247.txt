    "Question": "Q1: Is the mountain depicted as a symmetrical, perfectly conical shape with a pointed peak?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain is enclosed in a clear box and is significantly smaller than a real mountain, suggesting it is a miniature model. The shape of the mountain resembles a symmetrical cone with a pointed peak, typical of model representations aiming for a classic mountain form, confirming it is symmetrical and conical.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the summit of the mountain have a continuous white snow cap covering the top?",
    "explanation": "The summit of the mountain in Image B displays a consistent layer of white, indicating a snow cap. In miniature models, such representations are often used to convey snow-covered peaks, confirming a continuous white coverage at the top.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a clear, mirror-like reflection of the mountain in the lake below?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a miniature mountain landscape inside a glass box with a water feature at the base. The water does not show a clear reflection akin to a mirror-like surface due to the scale and representation in the model.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there small structures or buildings positioned along the edge of the lake, between the water and the mountain base?",
    "explanation": "Image B contains miniature cabins and structures along the perimeter of the lake within the model. These structures are placed strategically to give a sense of habitation and scale, reflected by the visible structures next to the lake beneath the mountain.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the sky visible above the mountain, appearing as a solid or gradient blue area?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not show a sky above the mountain. Instead, it focuses on the contained mountain environment inside a glass case, with no visible depiction of the sky. The central focus remains within the confines of the model, lacking any sky representation.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there visible layers on the mountainâ€™s slopes, showing a transition from white snow at the top to darker rock and then to green/brown vegetation below?",
    "explanation": "On Image B, there is a depiction of layered transitions on the mountain: white snow at the top, transitioning into darker rock, and then into greenery, typical of realistic miniature models attempting to emulate geological features of mountains.",
    "answer": "Yes"
