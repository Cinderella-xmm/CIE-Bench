      "question": "Does the image retain the vibrant lime-green color for the nesting dolls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are depicted next to the cleats. The color of these dolls is a vibrant lime-green, consistent with the color of the cleats in the image. This observation aligns with common color matching practices, where items designed to be part of a set often share similar color palettes. By examining the consistent color between the items in Image B, it is apparent that the image retains the vibrant lime-green color for the nesting dolls.",

      "question": "Do the nesting dolls retain the textured surface resembling the cleat's material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls appear to have a surface texture that looks very similar to the cleat's material. The cleat has a slightly pebbled, matte texture, typical of materials like leather or synthetic leather used in footwear to provide grip and durability. The nesting dolls also seem to exhibit this type of textured surface, suggesting a design choice to harmonize with the cleat material. By visually comparing the material surface of both the cleat and the dolls in Image B, it is evident they share a similar texture.",

      "question": "Do the nesting dolls incorporate the fuzzy texture and white seam of the tennis ball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are shown next to the cleat. Despite their bright lime-green color, the dolls do not exhibit the fuzzy texture or the white seam characteristic of a tennis ball. Instead, they share the smooth, slightly textured appearance of the cleat material. This indicates that the design of the nesting dolls in Image B does not include the tennis ball's specific fuzzy and seamed features.",

      "question": "Do the nesting dolls reflect the elongated shape of the soccer cleat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the nesting dolls do not reflect the elongated shape of a soccer cleat. The dolls are designed with a more cylindrical and compact form, which is typical of nesting dolls. This design contrasts with the elongated, narrow shape of the soccer cleat, which is more aerodynamic and tailored for sports use. The evident shape differences between the dolls and the cleat in Image B highlight that the dolls do not reflect the cleat's elongated shape.",

      "question": "Do the nesting dolls incorporate the rounded shape of the tennis ball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are not perfectly round like a tennis ball, but they do have a more rounded and cylindrical shape compared to the cleats. This shape is more reminiscent of a traditional nesting doll shape, which has a round top and a slightly wider body. While the dolls are not an exact replica of a tennis ball's shape, they do share a more rounded form, unlike the clearly elongated cleat. Therefore, the nesting dolls in Image B incorporate a rounded shape more similar to that of a tennis ball than the cleat, albeit not identical.",
