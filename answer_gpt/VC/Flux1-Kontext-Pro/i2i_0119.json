      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is still predominantly yellow. This is evident as the main body, arms, and head are colored in a consistent yellow, which matches the original Pok√©mon character, Psyduck. Psyduck is known for its bright yellow appearance, which is a signature feature. Combined with world knowledge of Psyduck's typical color, the color scheme in Image B remains true to this characteristic.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character clearly has the large, flat duck-like bill that is an iconic part of its design. The bill is drawn in a beige color, prominently featured as part of the keychain character's face. This aligns with world knowledge of Psyduck's defining features, where their bill resembles that of a duck and is large relative to its face. Image B shows this characteristic.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character exhibits a wide-eyed expression with both eyes open wide, giving it a bewildered and confused look. This is consistent with Psyduck's known expression, which usually depicts it in a state of puzzlement, often clutching its head as if experiencing a headache. The visual cues in the keychain version, such as the wide eye and pose, reflect this characteristic expression.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Neither Image A nor Image B features small triangular ears on the character's head. Psyduck, according to world knowledge of its design, does not have ears in the form of triangles; instead, most of its head is smooth and rounded like a duck. In Image B, just like Image A, there are no visible triangular ears, retaining the traditional appearance of Psyduck's round head.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the character with a distinctly rounded shape, consistent with the character design of Psyduck. Its head, body, and limbs are all drawn in a way that emphasizes a circular, chunky form. World knowledge of Psyduck acknowledges this iconic rounded silhouette, making it easily recognizable. The keychain version maintains this design, similar to Image A.",
