      "question": "Is the background composed of green grass with visible blades and natural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a background that appears to be green grass. The area behind the main subject (the dog and banana) displays features resembling blades and natural grass texture. This assessment is based on visual cues suggesting grass-like characteristics combining color and texture recognition, which align with common knowledge of what grass typically looks like.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there soft shadows cast by the subject(s) onto the grass, consistent with natural outdoor lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon analyzing the area where the banana and dog meet the grass, there are visible changes in tone that resemble shadows. These shadows are soft, suggesting they result from natural outdoor lighting, where objects often cast subtle shadows due to sunlight dispersion. This deduction is informed by observing the lighting effects commonly encountered in outdoor scenes.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the fused form positioned directly on the grass surface, with contact points visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the banana and dog resting on the grass. Visual observation shows clear points where the subjects contact the grass, such as the dog's paws and the base of the banana. This observation aligns with how objects typically interact with surfaces based on the perception of depth and spatial arrangement.",
      "weight": 2,

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the grass predominantly green with natural variations in shade and tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents grass that is predominantly green. There are slight variations in shade and tone throughout the grass area, reflecting the natural color changes seen in real grass due to sunlight and shadow effects, which are consistent with common visual experiences outdoors.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the fused form incorporate both yellow and tan hues, reflecting the original banana and dog colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the banana appears predominantly yellow, while the dog exhibits tan hues. This color combination reflects both the distinctive color traits of a banana and the dog, supporting that the colors have been preserved in the fused form, using the perceptions of these items' natural colors based on common knowledge.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are individual blades of grass visible in the foreground and midground, contributing to a textured surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals individual blades of grass in both foreground and midground, contributing to the surface texture that defines grass visuals, highlighting details and depth consistent with common appearances of grassy terrain when viewed closely.",
