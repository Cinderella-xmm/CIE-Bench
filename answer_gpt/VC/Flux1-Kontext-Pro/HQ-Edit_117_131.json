      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the squirrel have a large, bushy tail that curves upward and outward, extending above the back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoon squirrel in Image B is shown with an exaggerated, bushy tail that extends above its back, curving outward, consistent with how squirrels are often illustrated to emphasize their distinct tail features.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ears of the squirrel rounded and positioned on top of the head, with a visible pink inner surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel's ears appear to be more triangular and positioned on top of the head. There is no visible pink inner surface as the style has a simplified graphic look typical of cartoon illustrations, which may not focus on such details.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the eyes are represented in a cartoon style but are large, dark, and round. They are symmetrically placed on the head, a common stylistic choice to enhance character appeal in illustrations, even though specific pupil details might be less emphasized.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the head proportionally smaller than the body, with the tail approximately equal in length to the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoon squirrel in Image B appears to have a head-to-body proportion that is stylized; the head isn’t proportionally smaller as more realistic proportions are often exaggerated in cartoons. The tail, while prominent, doesn’t appear to be equal in length to the body if judging by realistic standards but matches the cartoon's aesthetic.",
