      "question": "Is the coarse, slightly cracked texture of the largest tortilla chip retained, including visible salt crystals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the largest tortilla chip is depicted as an animated character with a smooth, flat texture. It does not exhibit the coarse, slightly cracked texture of a real tortilla chip, nor does it show visible salt crystals. The edited image opts for a stylized representation instead of realistic textural details usually associated with tortilla chips.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the golden-brown color of the largest tortilla chip preserved, with natural tonal variation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the largest tortilla chip character possesses a flat, single-tone brown color that does not exhibit the natural tonal variation typically found in a golden-brown tortilla chip. The representation is more stylized than realistic, lacking the richer color variations of a real chip.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the chunky, uneven texture of the guacamole mound preserved, showing visible avocado pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guacamole character is depicted as a cartoon figure with rounded shapes and a uniform texture, lacking the chunky, uneven texture seen in natural guacamole. It exhibits polka-dot-like spots but doesn't show distinctive avocado pieces, suggesting a stylized artistry rather than realistic texture portrayal.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the green-yellow gradient of the guacamole preserved, showing natural avocado color variation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guacamole character is illustrated with a consistent green color featuring darker green spots. It does not include the green-yellow gradient typically present in real guacamole, which manifests due to natural color variation in avocados. The lack of such tonal variation indicates a switch to a simplistic artistic style.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the chip and guacamole rendered with realistic material properties, avoiding glossy or plastic-like finishes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the chip and guacamole characters are rendered in a cartoonish style, which naturally involves a more simplistic and flat representation. The finishes are not glossy or plastic-like, adhering to the basic traits of animated art; however, they don't possess realistic material properties typical of real food items depicted in Image A.",
