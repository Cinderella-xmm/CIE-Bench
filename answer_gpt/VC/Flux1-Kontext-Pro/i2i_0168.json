      "question": "Are the carrots depicted in a bright orange color with their rounded-tapered shape preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrots are clearly depicted in a bright orange color. Their shape is rounded at the top and tapers as it goes downwards, consistent with the typical shape of carrots. This observation aligns with the characteristics of carrots as known through common agricultural and biological knowledge, which states that they often have a vibrant orange color and a conical shape.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the carrots topped with bright green serrated leaves with a lobed appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leaves on top of the carrots in Image B are bright green, featuring a serrated and lobed appearance. This is characteristic of real carrot greens, which are known to have a feather-like, divided, and somewhat lobed structure. This observation is consistent with general botanical knowledge about the appearance of carrot foliage.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the soil texture surrounding the carrotsâ€™ roots preserved showing they are rooted in soil rather than snow or ice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground surrounding the carrots appears as loose, dark soil rather than snow or ice. The texture is granular and matches that of typical garden soil, used in agriculture for growing root vegetables like carrots. This suggests that the carrots are indeed rooted in soil, consistent with natural growth conditions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the carrots positioned in a way that shows they are partially underground, consistent with their natural growth pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The positioning of the carrots in Image B shows that they are partially buried in the soil, with only the top portion visible above ground. This is consistent with the natural growth pattern of carrots, where the majority of the vegetable grows underground, leaving the greens exposed above the soil.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the carrots have visible surface textures like natural ridges or marks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the carrots in Image B exhibits visible textures and natural ridges, which are common on carrots as they grow. These markings add to the authenticity of their appearance, reflecting the real surface irregularities one would expect from naturally grown carrots due to the soil and growth process.",
