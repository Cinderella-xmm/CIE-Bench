      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi dolls feature outfits that appear consistent with the color of the woman's top, a dusty rose hue. This is observed across all the dolls, suggesting that the color choice remains unchanged from Image A. Given the consistency in color across the representation of dolls mimicking the woman's attire, I conclude that the top remains dusty rose.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi dolls in Image B are wearing pants that visually appear to match the blue color of the woman's pants seen in Image A. By observing this color continuity all dolls replicate this feature, indicating that the pants color remains the same.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all chibi dolls are shown with hair that is visually brown. This suggests a maintained consistency of hair color with the womanâ€™s hair hue observed in Image A. This uniformity across the representation implies that the hair color is unchanged.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B shows the TV still placed on a wooden table. This is consistent with the setup in Image A. Despite the addition of chibi dolls, the location of the TV remains unchanged, visible through its positioning on the same table surface as initially seen.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, none of the chibi dolls are shown with a hand placed on the top edge of the TV, a clear deviation from Image A where the woman's hand was positioned there. The chibi dolls demonstrate different postures, indicating a change from the original setup.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background wall in Image B continues to appear as a plain off-white, identical to the surface in Image A. Despite adding multiple chibi dolls to the setting, the wall background color remains consistent throughout both images, corroborating the unchanged detail.",
