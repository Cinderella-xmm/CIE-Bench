      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows clear markings on the lower portions of the tank's front hull.

      "explanation": "In Image B, the tank's main gun barrel, a prominent feature of the tank's turret, is depicted extending directly outward from the front of the turret, oriented straight ahead.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual perspective in Image B shows the tank oriented directly towards the observer, revealing the details of its front hull, turret, and gun barrel. The straight-on view ensures clarity in viewing all the identifying features, indicating the tank is indeed front-facing towards the camera.",
