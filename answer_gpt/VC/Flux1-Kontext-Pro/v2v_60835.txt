    "Question": "Q1: Are the cheetahs still depicted in their original seated and standing postures on the earthen mound?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetahs are depicted in the same poses as in the original Image A. One cheetah is seated while the other is standing, both atop the earthen mound. The positioning of the cheetahs appears unchanged, focusing on their transformation into a mechanical or artistic interpretation with added metallic elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the earthen mound still present beneath the cheetahs?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the earthen mound is visually present beneath the cheetahs in the same position as in Image A, providing a physical base for the depiction of the now mechanized cheetahs. Despite changes to the cheetahs, the mound's presence remains consistent.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Do the cheetahs retain their black-ringed tails?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the cheetahs with tails, albeit styled to match their transformed mechanical appearance. The tails have visible rings in Image A, and in Image B, although mechanical elements are introduced, the tails maintain a semblance of the original pattern with a mechanical twist.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the background still feature a savanna landscape with greenery and a horizon line?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while a horizon line is evident, the background features a fantastical tower structure not present in Image A.
