    "Question": "Q1: Is the sun positioned low on the horizon, centered between the two silhouetted landmasses, and appearing as a bright, circular disc?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sun is clearly visible as a bright, circular disc located at a low position on the horizon. It is centered between two silhouetted landmasses, which frame its position effectively. This positioning is typically associated with sunsets and reflects common sunset imagery where the sun appears prominently on the horizon.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there two distinct silhouetted landmasses, one on the left and one on the right, framing the horizon and the sun?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows two dark, silhouetted landmasses on opposite sides. They frame the horizon and the sun in between them, creating a natural border that directs attention to the sunset scene. These landmasses are distinct, providing a clear contrast against the brighter sky.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Does the water surface reflect the orange-red gradient of the sky, creating shimmering patterns that mirror the sunset?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the water surface appears to reflect the warm hues of the sky created by the sunset. The result is a shimmering pattern on the water, which mirrors the orange-red gradient seen in the sky, a phenomenon typically observed during sunset due to the angle of the sun's light reflecting off the water.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the sky filled with a gradient of warm orange near the horizon transitioning to deeper red and maroon tones higher up?",
    "explanation": "The sky in Image B presents a clear gradient that starts with warm orange tones near the horizon, transitioning gradually to deeper reds and maroon tones as you move higher up. This is a common color gradient observed during sunsets, as atmospheric conditions scatter light differently and create such vibrant transitions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a clear, straight horizon line dividing the sky and water, with the sun resting directly on it?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the horizon line is clearly defined and straight, dividing the sky above and water below. The sun is illustrated resting directly on this horizon line, consistent with common sunset imagery where the sun dips toward or under the horizon.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there faint, thin clouds visible in the upper portion of the sky, partially illuminated by the sunset?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows faint clouds scattered in the upper portion of the sky, some of which appear illuminated by the light of the sunset. These thin clouds contribute to the composition of the scene, adding texture and depth to the colored sky.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the water surface show gentle ripples and small waves, indicating calm movement?",
    "explanation": "The water surface in Image B displays gentle ripples and small waves, suggesting a calm and tranquil movement often associated with peaceful sunset scenes over bodies of water.",
    "answer": "Yes"
