    "Question": "Q1: Is the tower visibly leaning to the right, maintaining its characteristic tilt?",
    "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the tower (known as the Leaning Tower of Pisa) is clearly leaning to the right. This characteristic tilt is a well-known feature of the tower, caused by unstable foundation soil, and is evident in the image as it prominently inclines to the right side. This observation aligns with common knowledge about the Leaning Tower of Pisa.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there exactly eight levels of arched arcades stacked vertically along the tower?",
    "explanation": "Visually analyzing Image B, we can count the levels. Each level is separated by a horizontal band or cornice, and the arched arcades are distinct. Image B shows that the tower indeed has eight visible levels of arches, with the observation aligning with historical knowledge of the Leaning Tower of Pisa's architectural structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a red flag mounted on a pole at the very top of the tower?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a red flag is discernible at the highest point of the tower, mounted on a pole. This detail corresponds with the common practice of placing flags at prominent locations on historical monuments. The visual cue is sufficiently clear to confirm the presence of the red flag.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there diamond-shaped decorative patterns embedded in the stonework at the base of the tower?",
    "explanation": "Upon inspection of Image B, the stonework at the base of the tower displays distinct diamond-shaped decorative patterns. These patterns are commonly found in historical buildings to add aesthetic appeal and are noticeable in the clear section of the image showing the base.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the tower exhibit a white and gray marble texture with visible horizontal bands separating each level?",
    "explanation": "The surface of the tower in Image B shows a predominantly white and gray color scheme, typical of marble. Each level is delineated by horizontal bands, enhancing the tower's layer-like appearance. This appearance is consistent with historical knowledge about the materials used in the construction of the Leaning Tower of Pisa.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there slender columns evenly spaced around the perimeter of each level, supporting the arches?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, it is evident that each level features slender columns that are evenly spaced around its perimeter. These columns act as supports for the arches above them, a feature that is characteristic of many classical architectural designs, providing both structural support and aesthetic unity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the tower positioned slightly to the right of the center of the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tower is clearly not centered but is instead positioned slightly to the right of the center of the image. This compositional choice can be analyzed by observing the negative space on both sides of the tower in the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
