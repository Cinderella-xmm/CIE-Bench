      "question": "Does the dog retain its white fur color and sharp, upright ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog has a completely white coat, indicating that its fur remains white. The dog's ears are also visible and appear to be sharply pointed and upright. This conclusion is derived from observing the dog's visible characteristics in Image B and applying common understanding that confirms its appearance has not fundamentally changed in these aspects.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dog's mouth open, showing its teeth and tongue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dog in Image B has its mouth open widely, clearly displaying its teeth and tongue. This feature suggests the dog is likely engaged in an active behavior such as panting or play. The visual details align with a common depiction of dogs in playful or excited states.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the dog wear a red collar around its neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is wearing a collar; however, the collar is blue, and the dog also wears a bow tie in the same color. This indicates a change from the expected appearance with a red collar. Observing the color and item worn by the dog leads to the conclusion that the original red collar is not present anymore.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dog's posture in Image B shows it running directly towards the camera, which is evidenced by its forward-facing body, the extension of its front legs, and its focused gaze ahead. This is characteristic behavior of a dog moving directly towards an object or the photographer.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is indeed on a grassy surface with trees that appear blurred in the background, both features that are commonly associated with a typical park or outdoor setting. This scene layout gives the image a sense of movement while keeping the dog as the focal point.",
