    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the capybara’s snout shape — including the rounded nose, wide mouth, and visible teeth — preserved in the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture seems to depict a stylized representation focusing on metallic elements, such as the use of brass, and the snout shape isn't visible due to the blurred face. We rely on the remaining visible features, none of which suggest a focus on the specific nose, mouth, or teeth details of the original image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the white muzzle area, positioned centrally on the face and extending from the nose to the upper lip, preserved in the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face of the sculpture is blurred, obscuring any details that would identify specific color patterns or textures like the white muzzle in the original image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the whiskers present and arranged in the same radial pattern from the snout as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visible whiskers are extending from the sides of the sculpture similar to the original image, maintaining a similar radial arrangement despite the face being blurred.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the glasses positioned directly over the eyes, with the frame aligned horizontally across the bridge of the nose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face section is obscured, so glasses or similar facial details cannot be assessed in the brass sculpture.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sweater and shoulder straps positioned on the shoulders and torso in the same way as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Instead of a sweater with shoulder straps, the sculpture depicts a metallic-style garment. The garment does not replicate the clothing arrangement of the original image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the capybara’s head shape — rounded, broad, and proportionally large relative to the body — preserved in the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture contains a prominent base that does not indicate a rounded, broad head shape similar to the original capybara image. The sculpture focuses on a more stylized, brass helmet-like design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the mouth depicted as slightly open, revealing the teeth, in the same manner as the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurred face of the sculpture obscures the mouth area, making it impossible to assess whether it is slightly open or showing teeth.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
