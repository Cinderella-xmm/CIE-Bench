      "question": "Is the red velvet cushion with visible quilted texture present beneath the saxophone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a red velvet cushion with a quilted texture is visible beneath the transformed serpent. The cushion appears to have a similar quilted design and fabric to the reference of a saxophone being potentially supported by such a cushion, reflecting that detail in the edited image. World knowledge of saxophone displays or decorative presentations supports such use of luxurious cushioning in images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a thin gold trim running along the outer edge of the red cushion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a red cushion beneath the transformed serpent, which does include a thin gold trim along its edges, using visual cues to assess this specific detailing. World knowledge about decorative cushions often includes such trimming for elegance, reaffirming the observation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the lighting source positioned above the saxophone, creating a bright central glow that fades into darkness toward the edges of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is positioned above the transformed serpent, casting a bright central spotlight that fades into darker edges. Such lighting positioning is typical to emphasize an object placed center-stage, reflecting the intent for illumination used to highlight an item like a saxophone or decorative object.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the saxophone (or transformed serpent) positioned diagonally across the cushion, extending from the lower left to the upper right of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a transformed serpent placed on a cushion, with its body coiled and its head angled upwards. The flow of the serpent's body can be seen extending in a diagonal manner from bottom to top of the display, much like how instruments such as saxophones could be positioned for dynamic visual interest.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background uniformly dark, with no visible objects or textures other than the spotlight glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's background is uniformly dark, substantially enriched by a central spotlight. The absence of additional texture or objects within that background aligns with common photographic practices of isolating the main subject against a dark backdrop for emphasis.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the transformed serpent retain a highly reflective, metallic surface with visible highlights and specular reflections consistent with polished brass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformed serpent in Image B exhibits a reflective metallic surface, potentially adorned with highlights and sparkling details akin to polished brass, deriving these reflectivity traits through visual cues about its surface properties, similar to polished metals.",
