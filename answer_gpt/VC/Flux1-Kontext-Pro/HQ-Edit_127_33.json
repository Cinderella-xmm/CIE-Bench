      "question": "Is the fountain located at the exact center of the garden layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fountain is prominently positioned toward the center of what appears to be a manicured garden. The placement of pathways, topiary structures, and flower arrangements suggests a design focused around this central fountain. Given the visual cues of symmetric pathways leading to this focal point, it is reasonable to conclude that the fountain is indeed positioned centrally.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the hedges and flowerbeds form a symmetrical radial pattern centered on the fountain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals a garden layout organized around the fountain, with hedges and flowerbeds appearing in a deliberate and repeated pattern on all sides of the fountain. This visual repetition and symmetry around a singular point align with characteristics of a radial pattern centered on the fountain.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there an arched gateway at the far end of the central path, aligned with the fountain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the view extends to the far end of a path beyond the fountain, yet there is no visible structure resembling an arched gateway. Instead, the scene includes other elements, but none featuring an arched gateway directly aligned with the fountain.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there traditional houses with thatched roofs and chimneys visible beyond the garden wall in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is filled with lush greenery extending into the horizon, without specific architectural elements such as traditional houses, thatched roofs, or chimneys. The focus remains within the garden area, and the distant landscape is dominated by natural features.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there pink roses clustered in the immediate foreground, closest to the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays pink roses prominently in the immediate foreground, creating a visual connection with the viewer. These roses are at the front of the scenery, reinforcing the sense of depth and floral abundance.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there purple lavender plants arranged in a ring around the base of the fountain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral arrangement around the fountain does include a variety of flowers, yet the specific organization into a distinct ring of purple lavender is absent. The arrangement is more varied without forming a complete lavender ring.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there two tall, cone-shaped topiary trees flanking the entrance to the garden?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, multiple tall, cone-shaped topiary trees are dispersed throughout the garden, including significant near-path elements. However, the pictorial scene does not feature a direct entrance flanked by two such trees serving as a gateway.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is there a visible horizon line separating the sky from the distant landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a serene garden landscape extending into the background, with a clear horizon line where the sky meets the distant treetops and landforms. This creates a visible separation and backdrop to the foreground garden.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does showcase pink roses and other varieties, yet the presence and placement of all mentioned flowers, including purple lavender and red tulips in specific original positions, are not confirmed. The scene reflects a harmonious blend rather than an exact replication of positions.",
