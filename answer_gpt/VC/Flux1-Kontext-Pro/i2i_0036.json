      "question": "Is the cat's fur entirely black?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject depicted has black fur across the visible parts of its body. The paws and the portions of the body that can be seen are entirely black. Based on this visual information and common knowledge that black cats typically have entirely black fur, it is reasonable to conclude that the fur is depicted as entirely black.",

      "question": "Is the cat still wearing the formal tie around its neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible portion of the subject includes what appears to be a formal tie around its neck, suggesting that this accessory is present. Based on common knowledge of what a tie looks like and its placement around the neck, it can be confirmed that the tie is still present.",

      "question": "Does the cat still have bright yellow eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes of the subject are obscured, thus not visible for color identification. Based on the inability to see the eyes, I cannot confirm the eye color.",

      "question": "Is the cat placed on a beige carpet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the subject lying on a surface that is beige in color, which can be identified as a carpet-like texture. This judgment is made based on the visible texture and color consistent with carpet material.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a uniformly colored, out-of-focus surface with no visible patterns like those typically seen on a bookshelf, such as rows of books. Thus, using visual cues and common understanding of what bookshelves look like, this does not suggest the presence of a bookshelf.",
