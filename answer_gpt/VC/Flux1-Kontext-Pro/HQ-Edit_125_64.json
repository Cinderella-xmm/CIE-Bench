      "question": "Is the pyramid visible in the background to the right of the Sphinx, with a clear triangular silhouette against the sunset sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a pyramid visible in the background to the right of the Sphinx. It has a clear triangular silhouette, enhanced by the warm colors of the sunset sky, which is a typical scene when depicting the Egyptian pyramids. This resemblance is drawn from the traditional representation of the pyramids, which usually show them silhouetted against a sunset or sunrise.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the sun positioned low on the horizon, directly behind the Sphinx, emitting a bright circular glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sun is positioned low on the horizon, directly behind the Sphinx's figure. The sun emits a bright circular glow, which creates a dramatic effect often used to emphasize the Sphinx's silhouette. This is a common artistic choice to enhance the visual appeal and atmospheric depth of such imagery.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a dense layer of clouds below the Sphinx, appearing illuminated with orange and pink hues from the sunset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no indication of a dense layer of clouds below the Sphinx. Instead, the scene shows a desert setting typical of the Egyptian landscape, with sand visible around the Sphinx. The focus is on the sand and desert environment rather than any clouds.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the Sphinx facing toward the right side of the image, with its profile visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Sphinx is portrayed in a frontal view rather than showing its profile facing to the right. The design in Image B is more stylized and does not conform to the traditional profile view seen in depictions of the Sphinx such as seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the sky show a smooth gradient from warm orange near the horizon to cooler purple and pink tones at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky predominantly retains warm tones in oranges and reds, supporting the atmospheric effect of the sunset. However, there is no evident smooth gradient from warm to cooler purple and pink tones as described. The color palette is consistent with thematic sunset depictions.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Sphinx is depicted with a highly stylized and artistic design, featuring a sleek and unified surface texture rather than realistic erosion lines or layered textures commonly seen in ancient stone sculptures like the traditional Sphinx.",
