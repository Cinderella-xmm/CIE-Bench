    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the mountain depicted as a symmetrical, perfectly conical shape with a pointed peak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain is enclosed in a clear box and is significantly smaller than a real mountain, suggesting it is a miniature model. The shape of the mountain resembles a symmetrical cone with a pointed peak, typical of model representations aiming for a classic mountain form, confirming it is symmetrical and conical.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the summit of the mountain have a continuous white snow cap covering the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The summit of the mountain in Image B displays a consistent layer of white, indicating a snow cap. In miniature models, such representations are often used to convey snow-covered peaks, confirming a continuous white coverage at the top.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a clear, mirror-like reflection of the mountain in the lake below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a miniature mountain landscape inside a glass box with a water feature at the base. The water does not show a clear reflection akin to a mirror-like surface due to the scale and representation in the model.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there small structures or buildings positioned along the edge of the lake, between the water and the mountain base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains miniature cabins and structures along the perimeter of the lake within the model. These structures are placed strategically to give a sense of habitation and scale, reflected by the visible structures next to the lake beneath the mountain.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sky visible above the mountain, appearing as a solid or gradient blue area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show a sky above the mountain. Instead, it focuses on the contained mountain environment inside a glass case, with no visible depiction of the sky. The central focus remains within the confines of the model, lacking any sky representation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible layers on the mountainâ€™s slopes, showing a transition from white snow at the top to darker rock and then to green/brown vegetation below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On Image B, there is a depiction of layered transitions on the mountain: white snow at the top, transitioning into darker rock, and then into greenery, typical of realistic miniature models attempting to emulate geological features of mountains.",
