    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the curved, tapering silhouette of the central golden skyscraper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookmarks show a design of skyscrapers drawn with straight lines, none of which curve or taper significantly. The central skyscraper in Image A features a distinct curved and tapering silhouette which is not reflected in the bookmarks. The bookmarks maintain a more uniform and linear design typical of generic skyline impressions.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the sharp, asymmetrical top of the leftmost skyscraper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the bookmarks in Image B, they depict uniformly straight-edged buildings lacking sharp, asymmetrical features. In contrast, the leftmost skyscraper in Image A has a pronounced, sharp, asymmetrical top. The bookmarks do not retain these distinct characteristics.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the stepped, rectangular form of the building next to the central tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bookmarks in Image B have a homogenous, streamlined design with no visible stepped or tiered structures. The building next to the central tower in Image A has a distinct stepped and rectangular appearance. The bookmark designs do not capture this aspect.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the vertical light strip pattern on the right-side skyscraper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookmark lines are plain and do not exhibit the vertical light strip patterns seen on the skyscraper in Image A. The skyscraper in Image A has a distinct facade pattern made up of vertical lights which are not presented in the metallic bookmarks.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the bookmark preserve the height-to-width ratio and tapering proportion of the central skyscraper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each bookmark displayed in Image B has a flat, consistent width without tapering, differing from the central skyscraper in Image A, which has a tapering silhouette contributing to its perceived height-to-width ratio. The bookmarks in Image B do not maintain these proportions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the wider base of the central skyscraper compared to its upper section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookmarks exhibit a uniform width from base to top, contrasting with the central skyscraper's design in Image A, which widens near the base before tapering upwards. The bookmarks do not retain this structural feature.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the red buoy present in the final image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The second image (Image B) contains bookmarks placed on a notebook page, a different setting entirely from the nighttime cityscape scene in Image A, which is where the red buoy is seen in the water. The bookmarks' setting does not include any landscape features such as water or buoys.",
      "weight": 1,
