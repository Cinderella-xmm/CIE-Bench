      "question": "Is the black bat with outstretched wings inside a red circle present on the label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no label to examine as the image only shows a black background. Therefore, based on the absence of visible label details, the specific feature of a black bat inside a red circle cannot be confirmed.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the word \"BACARDÍ\" displayed in bold black serif font above the word \"MOJITO\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains only a black background with no visible bottle or label details. Consequently, it's impossible to validate the presence of text, such as 'BACARDÍ' in any specific font or placement.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Because Image B only displays a black background without any discernible label features or text, there is no evidence of 'MOJITO' written in a green sans-serif font below 'BACARDÍ'.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black background of Image B implies the bottle's label and features are not visible. Thus, the presence of the signature 'Facundo Bacardí' in cursive script cannot be determined.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "With only a black background visible in Image B, no details of the label are discernible. Therefore, a mint leaf icon's presence cannot be verified.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The uniform black background of Image B means no text or label features are visible, so these words cannot be confirmed on the label.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given the absence of any visible label details in Image B, the presence of this specific phrase cannot be confirmed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B offers no details of a label due to the all-black background. Therefore, any text, specifically '15% ALC. BY VOL.', cannot be determined.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, only a black background is present, which prevents visualization of the bottle's shape or any structural features, including curves or a narrow neck.",
