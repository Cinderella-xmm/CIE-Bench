      "question": "Is the central tower of the fortress composed of multiple stacked, progressively smaller rectangular tiers forming a stepped pyramid shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central tower of the structure is indeed designed with multiple tiers that become progressively smaller as they ascend, creating a pyramidal effect. This design is reminiscent of a ziggurat or a stepped pyramid, where each layer reduces in size from the base to the top. This structure is visually consistent with architectural designs that emphasize a central focal point by stacking levels in a stepped formation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there regular, alternating tooth-like projections (crenellations) along the upper edges of the fortress walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fortress walls have the characteristic tooth-like projections along the edges, known as crenellations. These are regularly spaced and alternate between solid portions and openings, which are typical features of medieval fortifications providing both defense and a line of sight for defenders.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a prominent arched opening located at the lower front section of the fortress, serving as a main entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a distinct large arched opening at the lower front section of the fortress. This arch is positioned prominently and seems to function as a main entrance or gate, which is a common architectural element intended to allow access while also serving as a focal point in the design of fortified structures.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the waterfall originate from a gap in the cliff face directly beneath the fortress wall and cascade downward into the river below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waterfall appears to emanate from a position adjacent to the lower section of the fortress walls, suggesting it is flowing from a gap or opening beneath the structure. The water cascades downward into a river or pool below, illustrating a design where the waterfall is integrated into the landscape directly linked to the fortress's base.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the fortress situated on a raised cliff overlooking a river that flows through a narrow canyon below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the fortress situated on an elevated platform or base with a body of water below, but it does not clearly represent a canyon. The presence of the plate and design distinguishes it as more of a sculptural or artificial representation rather than a natural canyon setting. Thus, while the setting implies height and water, it does not satisfy the definition of overlooking a narrow canyon.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are clusters of green shrubs and trees visible along the canyon walls and riverbanks surrounding the fortress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, clusters of green elements are artistically placed around the fortress model to resemble shrubs or trees. These are positioned strategically across what would represent cliffs or ledges, as well as along the edges of the water, offering a decorative sense of greenery typical in modeled landscapes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the fortress have a solid rectangular base with vertical walls and corner towers supporting the upper levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fortress exhibits a solid, wide and somewhat rectangular base, with vertical walls that support the more complex upper levels. The design is simplified due to its sculptural nature but indicates a block-like foundational structure typical of fortified bases and visually represents corner towers that offer structural and defensive support.",
