    "Question": "Q1: Is the complex scrollwork and floral engraving pattern visible on the body, lid, and spout of the object?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a candle held in a cup-like vessel, with the text 'Eternal Elegance Candle' written on its body. The vessel features some decorative elements mainly around the rim and base, likely in the form of a simple floral pattern, but not as complex as scrollwork or extensive floral engravings covering its surface. World knowledge tells us that engraving on such items can vary widely in complexity, but the particular decoration here does not fully match the description of complex scrollwork seen in highly ornate items like silverware. Therefore, the object does not possess complex engravings on its sides seen in some teapots or antique vessels.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the object have a domed lid topped with a small finial at the apex?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a cup-like vessel with a lit candle, without any lid. The vessel's opening reveals the candle's flame and wax, and a lid would prevent the candle from burning. World understanding indicates that most candle holders are designed to remain open; thus, this object does not have a domed lid with a finial.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the object supported by a three-legged pedestal base with decorative feet?",
    "explanation": "The object in Image B is a cup-shaped vessel resting directly on its base, without any visible legs or supporting feet. Common knowledge suggests that objects like this often have flat bases for stability on surfaces. Therefore, there isn't a decorative three-legged pedestal evident.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a curved handle attached to the left side of the object, extending upward and backward?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a vessel with a curved handle attached to its left side, curving upward. World knowledge aligns this with typical designs for pitchers or jugs, where handles provide grip and are placed for user convenience. These types of handles typically extend up to ensure easy holding. Since it matches the description, the answer is affirmative.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a long, curved spout extending from the right side of the objectâ€™s body?",
    "explanation": "The vessel in Image B is designed more like a jug with an open top and lacks a long, curved spout extending from the side. Candle holders in such shapes generally have top openings; therefore, the description of a spout does not apply here. World knowledge indicates that spouts are characteristic of items meant for pouring, such as teapots or jugs, which do not match the candle holder.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the object placed on a polished wooden surface with a clear reflection visible beneath it?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the vessel is clearly positioned on a polished wooden table. The reflection of the vessel is discernible beneath it, which suggests a smooth and reflective surface. This aligns with typical prior knowledge that polished wood produces reflective imagery of objects placed upon it. Hence, the vessel does sit on such a surface with visible reflections.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are there decorative metal fittings where the handle attaches to the body?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a simple handle attached to a cup-like vessel without decorative metal fittings. The handle seems to be molded directly as part of the vessel rather than using extra metal fittings, referring to it as more common knowledge that many ceramic or porcelain items have integrated handles. Given the visible ornamentation is limited to rim decoration, the answer is negative concerning metal fittings.",
    "answer": "No"
