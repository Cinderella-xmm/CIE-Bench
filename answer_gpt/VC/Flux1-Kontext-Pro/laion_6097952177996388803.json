    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the two main mountain peaks still present and positioned side by side as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two mountain peaks are still visible. The left peak features a prominent rock face, while the right peak is farther back. They appear similar in position and form to Image A, indicating that they remain side by side. Though there is an added creature in the foreground, the fundamental layout of the mountains remains unchanged.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the summits of both peaks retain patches of snow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the peaks visible in the background continue to display snow patches. The snow-cover can be observed atop the distant peaks, maintaining a similar appearance to that in Image A, where the snow primarily highlights the vertical shapes of the mountain summits.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the horizontal and vertical rock strata visible on the mountain faces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain faces do exhibit vertical and horizontal patterns and textures that imply rock strata. These lines and details contribute to the rugged appearance, similar to Image A, where rock strata are distinctly showcased with shadow and texture.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the narrow road visible winding through the lower valley, extending toward the base of the mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no apparent road visible in the valley toward the mountains, unlike Image A, where a distinct narrow road meanders through the scene. The foreground and creature in Image B may obscure or replace the visibility of such a road.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the slopes covered in patches of brownish-orange heather and dry grass, particularly in the mid-ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The landscape in Image B includes a terrain that appears to be covered with brownish and orange hues which could be interpreted as patches of heather and dry grass. These colors are consistent with the natural grassland observed in Image A, despite the presence of the creature.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the sky uniformly overcast with no direct sunlight, resulting in soft shadows across the landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B appears cloudy and uniformly overcast, similar to Image A. This overcast sky leads to a diffused lighting condition, which results in soft shadows across the landscape, keeping the scene relatively dim and atmospheric without harsh contrasts.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the valleys show smooth, continuous contour lines that follow the natural slope of the land?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The valleys in Image B exhibit natural slopes that are smooth and continuous, conforming to the contours of the terrain. This is consistent with Image A, where the landscape naturally slopes and forms smooth lines due to the mountainous geography.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
