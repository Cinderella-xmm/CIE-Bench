      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the four minarets positioned symmetrically—two on the left and two on the right—relative to the central dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no minarets visible beside the central dome, as the structure has transformed into a fantastical, dragon-like creature with wings and legs. This transformation means the original architectural elements like minarets are not present in Image B.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the 15 July Martyrs Bridge clearly visible in the background, crossing the water behind the Hagia Sophia?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a fantasy landscape with a night sky and stars. There is no body of water or architectural features like bridges visible. The image predominantly focuses on the creature and the surrounding domes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is a large body of water visible behind the Hagia Sophia, extending toward the horizon with boats on its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a fantasy scene without the realistic elements of a cityscape, such as bodies of water or boats. The environment includes other domed structures and a stylized sky background, emphasizing the imagination rather than reality.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are green trees visible in the foreground, partially obscuring the base of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature green trees in the foreground. Instead, the scene shows a plaza surrounding the fantastical creature with some grass but not obscuring any base of the creature itself.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question": "Are multiple arched windows visible on the front-facing wall beneath the central dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no traditional architectural features such as arched windows visible beneath the central dome. The image portrays an imaginative structure with no conventional building aspects like windows.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are several smaller domes visible around the base of the central dome, forming a tiered roofline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a creature with a dome-like upper structure, but it does not involve smaller surrounding domes as part of a tiered architectural setting. The fantastical setting changes the building into a singular creature form.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the sky uniformly clear and light blue, indicating daytime conditions without clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is depicted as a fantasy night scene with stars and clouds, set in an imaginative universe rather than a clear blue daytime sky.",
