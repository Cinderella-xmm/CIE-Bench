      "question": "Is the man wearing a dark navy blue suit with a white dress shirt and a striped tie?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is depicted wearing a formal outfit. The suit appears to be dark navy blue, complementing a white dress shirt, with a visible striped tie that adds to the formal appearance. These visual cues are consistent with the traditional style of formal men's attire.",

      "question": "Does the ladder have visible wood grain and round dowel joints connecting each rung?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ladder has distinct characteristics that include visible wood grain, suggesting it is made of wood. However, the joints connecting each rung appear more stylized and do not clearly present as round dowel joints; rather, the joints are more simplified in appearance typically seen in miniature or model representations. This suggests that while the wood grain is present, the round dowel joints are not distinctly visible.",

      "question": "Is the window divided into six panes with a cream-colored frame and visible reflections of sky and trees in the glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a window that is stylized but similar to a real window. It has a cream-colored frame and is divided into six panes. However, the context of Image B being an edited miniature scene suggests it might not have realistic reflections present, which is typical of toys or models that lack complex reflective surfaces. Therefore, while the pane structure and frame are accurate, the reflections found in real windows are not depicted in this miniature representation.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the man depicted in a climbing posture with one foot on a lower rung and the other stepping up, hands gripping the ladder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is displayed in a dynamic climbing posture. One foot is positioned on a lower rung, while the other foot is moving upwards, with his hands gripping the ladder. This pose accurately captures the action of climbing a ladder.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the ladder positioned diagonally from the bottom left to the upper right, leading directly to the window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ladder is indeed placed at a diagonal angle that extends from the bottom left of the image towards the upper right, leading up to the window. This mirrored positioning in the miniature is similar to the orientation seen in real-life scenarios involving ladders leaning against walls or windows.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible reflections of sky and tree silhouettes in the window glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nature of the scene is a miniature depiction suggesting simplified and stylized design elements. Although the window has a realistic structure, the lack of realistic and complex reflections, such as sky or tree silhouettes, is noticeable. This simplification is typical for scale models, where detailing such as reflections isn't incorporated in the design.",
