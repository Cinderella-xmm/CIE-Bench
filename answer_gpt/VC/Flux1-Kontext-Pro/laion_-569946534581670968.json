      "question": "Is the golden-brown color present on the plush chicken wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the plush chicken wings have a uniform orange coloration rather than a varied golden-brown hue. The orange is consistent across the plush material, lacking the toasted or browned appearance typical of cooked chicken. Combining this with common knowledge on plush toys, which usually retain a single color for aesthetic reasons, we conclude the absence of golden-brown color.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the plush chicken wings shaped like real chicken wings, including distinct drumettes and flats?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush chicken wings have shapes resembling real chicken wings, showing distinct sections that can be identified as drumettes and flats. Even in plush form, they mimic the variation in shape seen in actual chicken wings, which is commonly done to adhere to realistic representations of food in plush toys.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a small white bowl located at the bottom right corner of the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a small white bowl on the plate, not precisely at the corner, but amid the plate's bottom area, nestled amongst the plush wings. This placement is near the corner but not exactly at it. World knowledge informs us that food presentations are often spaced out evenly to enhance visual appeal.",

      "question": "Is the object inside the small white bowl bright orange in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object within the bowl is bright orange, standing out distinctly against the white of the bowl and the pale background of the plate. This use of bright colors is typical in culinary presentations to draw attention, suggesting a sauce or dip.",

      "question": "Are there approximately ten plush chicken wings on the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B visually indicates there are nine plush chicken wings arranged on the plate. The term 'approximately' allows for some variance, but the visual cues strongly suggest the count is closer to nine than to ten.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the placement of the small white bowl is generally towards the bottom right area of the plate, albeit slightly centralized from the corner. It remains close enough to be described as near the bottom right compared to other parts of the plate.",
