      "question": "Is there a visible gular pouch located beneath the lower mandible of the beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object depicted is a cartoon representation of a pelican. Cartoon illustrations often simplify or exaggerate features for stylistic reasons. The beak is shown with a straight line, and there is no distinct representation of a gular pouch beneath the lower mandible. In realistic depictions of pelicans, the gular pouch is a prominent feature used to catch fish. Given this simplified representation, the absence of a visible gular pouch is noted.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the feet clearly webbed with visible claws at the tips of each toe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feet of the cartoon pelican are drawn in a simplified manner typical of cartoon illustrations, with no distinct webbing or claws. Webbed feet and claws are common features of real pelicans, but in this cartoon style, simplification leads to the absence of detailed features.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the feathers on the body composed of layered, striated structures with visible individual feather shafts and overlapping edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The feathers in Image B are represented in a cartoon style. They are simplified with blue shading but do not exhibit the realistic depiction of individual overlapping feather shafts that you typically see in nature. The lack of fine detail and the use of blocks of color further support this choice.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bird have a long neck curving down from the head to a broad, rounded body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon pelican has a long neck that curves down from the head and connects to a broad, rounded body. This representation aligns with the common anatomy of a pelican, simplified for a cartoon style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are both legs positioned under the body, supporting the pelican in a grounded standing pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoon pelican in Image B is shown with its legs positioned under its body in a grounded pose. This stance is visually similar to how real pelicans stand, even though the cartoon simplifies the anatomy.",
      "weight": 2,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon pelican has a large, exaggerated eye on the side of its head, typical of cartoon characters. While it's not dark, the prominent feature of a round eye on the side of the head is present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon pelican does not feature a tuft of feathers raised at the crown of its head, which is sometimes seen in real-life birds for added detail in their representation. Cartoon styles often omit such details.",
