        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard is clearly visible with a vibrant design featuring a sun motif and wavy lines.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is observed wearing a red cap, which is discernible against the blue sky, a black shirt that contrasts with the beige jacket. These colors and items of clothing are consistent with what is observed in Image A. There is no indication of any alteration in wardrobe between the two images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B shows the skateboard above the subject's head, capturing the dynamic motion of the board as if it were mid-air. This positioning is identical to that seen in Image A, which confirms that the positioning of the skateboard has remained the same.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the subject's face is intentionally obscured by a blur edit. Thus, the facial features and expression are not visually accessible, making it impossible to assess them. However, since the question is formulated generally, and without considering the blurred portion, the intact visibility of the face is missing.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body language of the subject is similar to that in Image A, characterized by the posture and the holding of the skateboard. Although the face is blurred, the rest of the posture and situational context suggests the subject has retained their stance, indicating confidence reflected through the bodily pose.",
