      "question": "Is the winged \"B\" logo visible on the rear of the vehicle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is not a traditional vehicle but rather a futuristic boat-like structure. There's no visible winged 'B' logo typically associated with vehicles like Bentleys. My analysis is based on the observation that this design does not feature conventional car emblems.",

      "question": "Is the \"BENTLEY GREENWICH\" text visible on the rear license plate area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure does not have a traditional license plate area as seen in a standard vehicle setup. It appears as a boat without license features, therefore the 'BENTLEY GREENWICH' text is not visible or applicable here.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the vehicle retain a silver metallic color as its primary surface tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the futuristic boat-like structure has a predominantly silver metallic surface, which aligns with what is described as a primary surface tone. Despite the unconventional vehicle type, the coloring resembles a metallic finish.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a continuous chrome trim line visible along the lower side of the vehicle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure does not have a traditional vehicle design with chrome trim lines along the lower side. This model lacks such features typical in cars, so no continuous chrome trim line is observed.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the vehicle displayed on a circular black platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the object rested on cylindrical supports rather than a circular black platform. The appearance is more akin to art installation supports than typical vehicle display platforms. Hence, it is not on a circular black platform.",
