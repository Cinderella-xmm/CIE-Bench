    "Question": "Q1: Is there a large pink peony flower prominently displayed on the body of the teapot?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a container rather than a teapot, which doesn’t feature any flower pattern, especially not a large pink peony flower. This is determined by closely examining the design and outer surface of the container, which displays bamboo prints instead of floral designs.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a white clustered flower located next to the pink peony on the teapot?",
    "explanation": "Image B, which contains a cylindrical container, does not feature any floral designs. Instead, the container is decorated with bamboo artwork and no white clustered flowers or any other flowers are visible. This indicates that no white clustered flower is present.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there green leaves and stems extending from the base of the flowers on the teapot?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, it is clear that there is bamboo artwork with green leaves on the container instead of floral designs with stems extending from a flower. The natural bamboo designs bear only bamboo leaves and no stems from flowers.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the floral elements include pink, white, green, and orange-red berry-like accents?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the surface decoration of the container is primarily of bamboo and does not include any floral elements, especially not pink, white, green floral patterns or orange-red berry accents. This design excludes any such intricate floral realism typically seen in a traditional teapot design.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is amber-colored tea visible in all four cups?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, amber-colored tea is visible in only one of the cups. The other cups are empty which becomes clear when looking at the stack of cups next to the filled one. Thus, not all four cups contain amber-colored tea.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the floral elements centrally located on the body of the teapot?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows no teapot but a decorative container with bamboo designs and no floral elements at all. The central design is bamboo-oriented with no flowers being present, negating any possibility of centrally-located floral elements.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the teapot surface exhibit a fine mesh or woven-texture appearance?",
    "explanation": "The surface of the container shown in Image B doesn’t have a fine mesh or woven texture, instead, it is smooth with bamboo designs adorned onto it. The texture isn’t comparable to mesh-like or woven surfaces typical of the earlier referenced teapot.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Are there exactly four cups present in the scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, one can count a total of five cups positioned next to the container. Four of these cups are stacked, and one is unstacked and appears filled with tea. This cumulative count of cups is more than four.",
    "answer": "No"
