      "question": "Is the shallow wooden tray beneath the tagine present and retaining its original shape, material, and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tagine is resting on a pedestal-like base rather than a shallow wooden tray as seen in Image A. The height and design differ, indicating an absence of the original wooden tray.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glass bottle containing golden olive oil with a cork stopper visible in the background, resting on a small pedestal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible glass bottle resembling the one in Image A. The focus in Image B is on a decorative tagine with magical elements, and background objects like the bottle are missing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table surface looks similar to the one in Image A, as it shows comparable texture, grain, and natural wear, although the lighting effects make it less prominent.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the upper right corner contains abstract, magical elements rather than real plants, such as the cilantro plant from Image A. This indicates that the cilantro plant is absent.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the olive oil bottle positioned slightly behind and to the left of the tagine, elevated on a small circular pedestal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show an olive oil bottle in the described position. The focus on fanciful elements like floating orbs replaces such objects seen in Image A, including the olive oil bottle.",
