    "Question": "Q1: Is the main subject of the new scene (seaside café elements) centrally positioned on the table?",
    "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the main subject, which is the smartphone in a charging dock, is positioned centrally on the table. The table's edges are visible, suggesting the subject is centered. Given commonly staged photography, central positioning is typical to emphasize the subject; thus, the world knowledge supports this observation.",

    "Question": "Q4: Are there distinct sunlight reflections visible on the table surface in the new scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is indicative of direct sunlight as seen from the brighter spots on the table's surface.

    "Question": "Q5: Can you see subtle sea wave reflections in the background or on the table surface in the new scene?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a coastal setting with visible waves in the background. However, the table surface does not show reflections of these waves.
