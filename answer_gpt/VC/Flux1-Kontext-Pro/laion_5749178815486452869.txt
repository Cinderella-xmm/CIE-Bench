    "Question": "Q1: Does the open umbrella retain its circular canopy shape with visible radial ribs converging at a central hub?",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the closed umbrella present with a black casing, wrist strap, and metallic tip?",

    "Question": "Q3: Is the starlit sky with visible stars and nebulae still present as the background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is shown with celestial bodies, notably stars and planets, against a blue backdrop. While this can resemble a starlit sky with stars, it does not show the complex features of nebulae typically associated with the night sky. Thus, it possesses elements of a celestial background, but not identical starlit sky with nebulae as seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
