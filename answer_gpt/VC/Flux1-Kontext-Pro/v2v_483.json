      "question": "Is there a handheld fan with a circular blade structure being held in the man’s right hand, directed toward the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man’s right hand is clearly holding a handheld fan, characterized by a circular blade structure. The positioning of the fan is such that it is directed toward the cake, which is evident from the angle at which he is holding it. Based on these visual cues combined with the common knowledge of how handheld fans are typically designed and held, the correct option is concluded.",

      "question": "Are there exactly seven candles on the cake, with visible flames and smoke rising from them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible candles on the cake, and upon careful counting, there are exactly seven candles. Each candle has a visible flame with smoke rising, indicating that they are burning. Combining these observations with the general understanding of how birthday candles appear when lit, the judgment is confirmed.",

      "question": "Is there visible smoke rising from the candles on the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows candles with flames, and surrounding these flames is visible smoke. This suggests active burning of the candles, as smoke is typically associated with burning substances. Thus, combining visual cues from the image with common knowledge about candles, the observation is validated.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the man leaning forward with his mouth puckered as if blowing air toward the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is holding a fan directed at the cake, but there are no visual cues indicating that he is leaning forward with puckered lips as if actively blowing air. His posture suggests reliance on the fan rather than manual blowing. Considering these visual elements, the conclusion is drawn.",

      "question": "Is the cake placed on a white plate, which is on a wooden surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the cake sitting on a white plate, and this plate rests upon a wooden surface. This is determined from the noticeable texture and color of the plate and the underlying surface, aligning with typical materials seen in such settings. Based on visual evaluation combined with world knowledge of dining setups, this option is affirmed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the handheld fan positioned so that its airflow is directed toward the candles on the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handheld fan is held in a manner where its circular blade is directed towards the cake. Given the angle of the fan, the intended airflow from this fan would logically move toward the candles. Observing these details alongside the common functions of handheld fans, the airflow direction inference is made.",
