      "question": "Is the rectangular wooden window frame with stone pillars on both sides present and unaltered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on a lizard-like creature with a sombrero, with no window frame visible in the scene. The creature is positioned directly on a sandy desert terrain, and there's no evidence of any architectural structures like a window frame or stone pillars surrounding it. Therefore, the features of a window frame and stone pillars are absent in Image B.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the distant mountains and multiple upright cacti visible in the background beyond the window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background showcases a vast desert landscape with sand dunes, and no specific distant mountains or cacti can be observed. Instead, the environment is predominantly sandy, which does not match the idea of a mountainous or cactus-filled landscape.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the shadow of the pot cast to the left on the wooden sill, indicating sunlight from the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no potted plant or wooden sill present. The scene involves a creature on a natural rocky base without any indication of a pot or a wooden sill where shadows would be cast. The lighting conditions suggest an evenly lit environment without significant shadows altering in that manner.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sky above the desert a clear blue with scattered white clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a sky that is indeed clear blue with occasional flowing cloud formations, maintaining a similar weather depiction of clear skies from its appearance. The sky is clean and resembles typical desert climates with few clouds present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the windowsill made of weathered wooden planks with visible grain and cracks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible windowsill made of wooden planks. Instead, the environment is a desert setting with no constructed elements from a window or sill, consistent with the visualization of a sandy outdoor scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the transformed creature positioned centrally within the window frame, on the windowsill?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformed creature in Image B is not positioned within any kind of window frame nor on a windowsill. Instead, it stands prominently on a stone-like base in an open desert environment, showing that the concept of a window or windowsill is not applicable here.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the ground beyond the window a flat, arid desert terrain with sparse dry grass and shrubs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scene in Image B is that of a desert landscape, where the ground is predominantly flat with sand. However, there are no visible details of dry grass or shrubs beyond a window, as there is no window feature, and the creature is directly on the desert terrain.",
