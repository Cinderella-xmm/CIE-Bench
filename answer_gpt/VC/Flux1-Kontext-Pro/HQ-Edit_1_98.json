    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the subject standing in profile, facing right, with the violin resting under her chin and the bow actively drawn across the strings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl's position does not seem to be in a specific profile view facing right with the violin resting under her chin. The subject is holding the violin and bow in her hands, and her posture suggests playing the violin, but not necessarily in profile and facing right. The body and head are not clearly in profile to indicate she is specifically facing right.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the violin have two f-holes, a curved body, a neck, and a scroll at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the violin depicted has the typical design elements, including a curved body, neck, and a scroll at the top. Although it's subtle, the standard design of a violin generally includes two f-holes on the body. These features are consistent with a traditional violin structure.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the window composed of six rectangular panes arranged in two rows of three, with a wooden frame surrounding them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any window design with six rectangular panes. The background shows a sky with musical notes, not a typical room setting with a window.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a small wooden stool positioned to the left of the window, supporting a potted plant with feathery light-green leaves in a beige ceramic pot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no evidence of a window or any furniture such as a stool supporting a potted plant with specific leaves as described. The setting is more artistic and abstract without these elements.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a woven basket on the floor to the right of the subject, containing a potted plant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks the depiction of floor-based elements like a woven basket. The setting is decorative with surrounding musical motifs and an elegant backdrop, without typical household objects visible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a hanging plant with trailing vines suspended from a shelf on the wall to the right of the window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no clear depiction of any hanging plant with trailing vines or a shelf as the background is primarily filled with sky and musical notes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are distinct rectangular shadows from the window panes visible on the wooden floor, aligned with the window’s grid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not feature a floor or any shadows that indicate the presence of window panes. The theme of the image lacks a structured room setting.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's feet appear to be covered with shoes or decorative footwear, consistent with the elegant, artistic theme of the image, and there is no visible wooden floor as the background transcends realistic indoor settings.",
