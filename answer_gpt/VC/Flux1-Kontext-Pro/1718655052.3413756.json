        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's eyes are not visible. Typically, a dog's eyes would be symmetrically positioned on either side of the face, but currently, there is no visible feature to confirm this.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show a visible black nose centered on the snout. In general, a dog's nose would be centrally located at the front of the face, but the image does not provide this detail.",
