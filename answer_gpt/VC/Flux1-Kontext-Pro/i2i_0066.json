      "question": "Does the image retain the English Bulldog's tan coat and white facial markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is a sculpture, and sculptures are typically monochromatic unless painted. From the visual cues, the bulldog is depicted in a solid color, presumably to resemble a stone or plaster statue, without individual color details like tan or white markings. This contrasts with the natural coloration visible in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the English Bulldog still positioned balancing on the skateboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bulldog sculpture is positioned on a skateboard, but as a static figure due to its material nature, it cannot be balancing like a live dog would be. It is positioned on the skateboard but in a non-interactive, stationary manner as part of a sculptural display. In contrast, Image A shows the bulldog actively standing on a skateboard in an outdoor environment.",

      "question": "Is the background still an outdoor setting with grass and buildings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts an indoor setting, likely an exhibition or gallery space, as inferred from the presence of people and display stands typical of event venues. This differs significantly from the outdoor setting seen in Image A with grass and buildings.",

      "question": "Is the skateboard still blue with its original design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skateboard in Image B, as part of the sculpture, lacks color details and is presented in the same single material color as the bulldog sculpture. This diverges from the original Image A's distinctive blue skateboard.",

      "question": "Does the English Bulldog still wear a black harness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bulldog sculpture appears without a harness, as the sculpture does not include painted or additional materials representing a harness, unlike the black harness clearly visible on the dog in Image A.",
