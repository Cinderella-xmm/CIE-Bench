      "question": "Does the chibi-style keychain retain the round glasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image B does not display any glasses on the chibi keychain. Typically, glasses are a significant feature and would be noticeable. In visual presentations like this, omissions are easily spotted, and combining this with knowledge of chibi designs, which tend to simplify features, indicates the absence of glasses.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style keychain maintain the brown hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi keychain can be seen with hair styled similarly to typical chibi design representations. World knowledge suggests that in character representations, the hairstyle colors are generally consistent unless explicitly changed in the design process. As Image B demonstrates brown hair on the chibi keychain, it confirms this continuity.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the white shirt and red-and-yellow striped tie present on the chibi-style keychain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows that the chibi keychain is designed with a white shirt and a tie featuring red and yellow stripes, which are classic features often used to maintain character details even in stylized forms such as chibi. This adherence to the uniform design ensures recognition.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the dark cloak included in the chibi-style keychain design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B visibly includes a dark cloak in the chibi keychain design, a recurrent feature in character depiction intended to replicate the attire of the original. Derived from knowledge of character costume continuity, the presence of a cloak implies intentional design efforts to maintain recognizable outfit features.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style keychain maintain the overall original color scheme, including skin, hair, glasses, shirt, tie, and cloak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon reviewing Image B, elements like the brown hair, white shirt, and red-yellow tie confirm the original color scheme is broadly retained, except for the absence of glasses. Chibi adaptations typically keep the essence of the color scheme, as depicted here with dark cloak and attire colors.",
