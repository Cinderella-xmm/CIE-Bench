      "question": "Are the cabinet doors and drawers designed in a shaker style in both views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the top-down and side views depict simple cabinetry consistent with shaker-style design characterized by a flat panel and rail frame construction. The simplicity and clean lines represent the classic shaker style. Therefore, based on world knowledge of what constitutes shaker-style cabinets, the top-down and side views of the cabinet confirm the shaker design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do both the top-down and side views show two rectangular sink basins with consistent dimensions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both views (top-down and side) show only one sink basin, not two. This indicates that there is no depiction of two sink basins with consistent dimensions visible in the top-down or side views. Therefore, using visual information alone, only one sink is depicted in each view.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the black faucets present above each sink basin in both views with the correct orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top-down view shows a single black faucet above one sink basin, while the side view shows the same orientation for one faucet above one basin as well. There is no depiction of multiple faucets corresponding to multiple basins, which was a characteristic of the original image in Image A. The top-down and side views correctly show the orientation of the single faucets above each sink basin depicted.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the countertop depicted in both views as a light-colored marble texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the countertops in both top-down and side views appear to have a uniform light color but do not explicitly depict a marble texture. They appear to be plain without intricate textures typical of marble surfaces. Therefore, based on world knowledge and visual cues, the countertops do not show a definitive marble texture.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the compartments (drawers and cabinets) arranged in the same manner in both the top-down and side views, mirroring the original layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top-down view shows only cabinet doors with no drawers and a plant on the countertop. The side view matches this setup, again depicting only a single set of double cabinet doors and a plant next to the sink. Unlike Image A, there is no arrangement of multiple drawers or cabinets. Therefore, the layout in Image B does not mirror the original layout shown in Image A, where drawers were present.",
