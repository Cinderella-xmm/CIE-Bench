      "question": "Is the owl perched on a moss-covered branch with visible green moss texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the branch the owl is perched on displays a texture that resembles moss, although the color and texture appear altered compared to natural moss. The visual cue indicates some green elements that are reminiscent of moss, suggesting a moss-covered branch. This is consistent with common forest scenes where branches often have moss. Therefore, the answer is deduced from these visual cues interpreted with common knowledge of forest environments.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a small green plant with slender leaves growing next to the owl’s left side on the branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible signs of a small green plant with slender leaves next to the owl's left side on the branch. The area beside the owl appears to be covered in decorative elements that match fantastical, jeweled designs rather than natural plant growth. The absence of such a plant is inferred through examining the bird and branch where elements lean towards an artistic rather than natural portrayal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background composed of dark, out-of-focus green foliage typical of a forest environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background that appears to be composed of blurred dark green tones, mimicking the effect of foliage typical in forest settings. The dark and out-of-focus style aligns with common representations of forest environments where depth of field focuses on the subject (owl) while the background appears naturally indistinct.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the owl facing directly toward the camera with a slight head tilt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl’s posture suggests it is facing straight with wings spread wide, a position indicating direct engagement with the camera without any noticeable head tilt. The positioning and the owl's gaze further reinforce the notion of direct focus towards the camera, commonly seen in wildlife photography and fantasy portraitures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the branch have a rough, textured surface covered in green moss with visible patches and crevices?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The branch in Image B possesses a fantastical and stylized design more than a realistic representation, with decorative gemstones integrated into its surface rather than visible natural texture with patches and crevices. The artistic elements suggest an embellishment of reality, whereby natural details like moss texture appear creatively interpreted.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the lighting dim and natural, with subtle highlights on the owl’s feathers and eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's lighting seems more theatrical or artistic rather than strictly natural. Highlights and luminescent elements on its feathers and central feature (glowing orb) suggest fantasy-enhanced lighting rather than dim natural light. Such embellishments are common in imaginative artwork where lighting is adjusted for aesthetic impact.",
