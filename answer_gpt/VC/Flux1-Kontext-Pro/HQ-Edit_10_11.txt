    "Question": "Q1: Is the gorilla depicted in a seated pose with its left hand resting under its chin?",
    "explanation": "Observing Image B, the pose of the gorilla is analyzed. The gorilla is indeed sitting, with its left hand poised in a manner indicative of resting under its chin. This is a common pose used to convey a contemplative or thoughtful demeanor in representations. Common knowledge of gorilla anatomy is applied to discern the left hand positioning based on the overall posture and body orientation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the gorilla have a prominent brow ridge, wide nose, and strong jawline consistent with a silverback gorilla?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla sculpture's head is blurred, preventing a detailed observation of specific features like the brow ridge, nose, and jawline. Typically, a silverback gorilla is characterized by these features. However, due to the blurred section, it's not possible to confirm these aspects directly from the image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a distinct patch resembling a silver saddle located across the back and shoulders of the gorilla?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, which depicts a wooden sculpture of a gorilla, differences in color tones like a silver saddle patch, typical in silverback gorillas, cannot be distinguished. Since this is a monochromatic wood carving, the detailed depiction of a silver saddle is not observed.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the gorilla positioned on a horizontal surface that resembles a log or platform?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden carving presents the gorilla sitting on what appears to be a horizontal surface mimicking a log. This is inferred from the visual representation where the gorilla is placed in a seated position upon a textured horizontal beam that represents a log.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the gorilla’s right arm resting on its right knee?",
    "explanation": "Within Image B, the gorilla's body posture is displayed with the right arm positioned lower, resting on its right knee, which is common in how gorillas balance while in a seated position. This observation matches with typical anatomical positioning of a gorilla in such poses.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the gorilla’s gaze directed forward and slightly downward?",
    "explanation": "Due to the face being blurred in Image B, the direction of the gaze is not discernible. Generally, understanding gaze direction requires a clear view of facial elements like the eyes, which are obscured here. Thus, it's not possible to definitively assert the direction of the gorilla's gaze.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are there leaf-shaped elements present in the background, even if stylized or etched?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, leaf-shaped elements do appear etched into the wooden background of the sculpture, providing a naturalistic context that complements the gorilla's forest theme. These elements are deliberately stylized and part of the overall aesthetic design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
