      "question": "Does the ship retain exactly three masts, with sails arranged in tiers on each mast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship is encased in a glass dome, and it features multiple masts with sails. By observing the arrangement, the ship has three masts with sails layered in tiers. This is a common design in traditional ships, allowing efficient sailing, indicating the number of masts and tiered sails are unaffected by the change from Image A to the model setting in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the ship’s hull shaped with a raised stern and a decorated, upward-curving prow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a detailed model of the ship within a dome. The hull still maintains the characteristic features of classic ship designs, such as a raised stern and a decorative, upward-curving prow. This is evident from the visible angled design and elevation at the front and back, which are unaffected in the transition from the animated setting of Image A to the model display in Image B.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there multiple sails on each of the three masts, with at least two tiers per mast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the ship model has masts with multiple sails set in tiers, which appears to be traditionally arranged with at least two layers per mast. The preservation of these features showcases the authenticity of the ship's design, similar to those seen in historical ships with rigged setups.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there at least five seagulls visible in flight around the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite its smaller, crafted form within a dome, the depiction remains consistent in showing seagulls circling the ship. By counting the visible seagulls around the ship model in Image B, there are fewer than five seagulls visible, differing from the flying seagulls depicted in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the ship oriented such that the bow points toward the left side of the image and is slightly elevated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship model sits within a glass enclosure. Observing the orientation, the bow points towards the right side of the image, not the left, indicating a mirrored direction compared to Image A, where the bow points right. This involves recognizing the typical directional perspective used in model displays, which often don't adhere strictly to animated orientations.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible portholes along the sides of the ship’s hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B presents a ship model with a well-defined hull. However, upon examining closely for details, there are no visible holes along the ship’s sides, such as portholes. This illustrates the trait of model displays to focus on broader structural features over finer details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the ship positioned above the surface of the water/resin layer, appearing to float?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship model is seen within a dome on a stable base, with the ship seemingly fixed onto a resin surface depicting water. It is not above the surface nor appearing to float, indicating a contrast to the more animated floating depiction in Image A.",
