      "question": "Is the squirrel depicted in an upright stance, supported by its hind legs, with its front paws raised toward its mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The squirrel in Image B is illustrated standing on the grass with two feet on the ground. This pose enables it to bend forward easily, making it ready to gather items like acorns, as seen in Image A. The squirrels can assume a similar posture when they are seated or standing, as they often use their front paws for holding or manipulating objects. However, the exact portrayal shows it standing on all fours, suited for ground mobility.",
