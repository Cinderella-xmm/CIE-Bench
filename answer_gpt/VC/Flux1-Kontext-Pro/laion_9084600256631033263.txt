    "Question": "Q1: Is the 'DATSUN' text visibly present and centered on the front of the decanter?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the decanter does not display any text that can be identified as 'DATSUN'. Instead, the front of the object features a Mercedes-Benz logo, indicating that the 'DATSUN' text is absent. This analysis is based on visual identification combined with brand recognition knowledge.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the '240Z' script visible on the side of the decanter near the front wheel well?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals no visible '240Z' script on the side near the front wheel well of the decanter.

    "Question": "Q3: Does the decanter maintain the long hood and short rear deck proportions of the original car?",
    "explanation": "The edited Image B retains the characteristic proportions of a classic roadster with a long hood and a relatively shorter rear deck, similar to sports cars' design language. This is visually apparent and understood by recognizing typical car design proportions.",

}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are vertical slats visible on the front of the decanter, mimicking the original grille pattern?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the grille design does not contain vertical slats typical of some older vehicles. Instead, it has a grille associated with a Mercedes-Benz style, suggesting that there are no vertical slats as part of its design. This is determined by visual inspection and knowledge of typical grille designs.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the 'DATSUN' emblem positioned centrally on the front face of the decanter?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a central emblem that is not the 'DATSUN' branding but instead features a Mercedes-Benz logo. The absence of the term 'DATSUN' confirms this assessment. This conclusion is drawn from combining visual evidence with brand awareness.",
