      "question": "Does the boy's face retain clear and recognizable features such as eyes, nose, and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boy’s face appears blurred with no clear features such as eyes, nose, or mouth visible. This indicates an intentional edit to obscure these details, likely for privacy reasons. This aligns with world knowledge wherein faces are commonly blurred in images to protect identities.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are all four original birds present, with the macaw on the shoulder, the cockatoo on the arm, the canary on the head, and the parakeet near the side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B visually maintains the presence of the four birds: a macaw positioned on the shoulder, a cockatoo on the arm, a canary on the head, and a parakeet situated near the side. Despite stylistic edits, their relative positions are conserved, allowing identification of all birds. This matches with the common understanding that objects like birds would retain their relative positions even in edited versions unless purposely altered.",

      "question": "Is the cartoon print on the boy's green T-shirt still visible and intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cartoon print on the boy's green T-shirt clearly, with visible characters and design details. This indicates the edit did not alter or remove the shirt's print. Such details remain recognizable, demonstrating continuity of specific elements even after illustration-based edits.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the boy’s head visibly larger compared to the shrunken size of the birds in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual examination shows the boy’s head has maintained a size similar to Image A, whereas the birds, due to the illustrative style and white outlines, appear smaller or altered in proportion. This change might be an artistic choice common in illustration edits, where size can be exaggerated or minimized.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a distinct and thick white outline encircling the boy and birds in the style of vector or illustrative edits. Such outlines are frequently used in illustrations to emphasize subjects and differentiate foreground from background, enhancing clarity and artistic style.",
