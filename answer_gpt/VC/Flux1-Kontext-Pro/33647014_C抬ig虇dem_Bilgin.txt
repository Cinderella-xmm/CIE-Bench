    "Question": "Q1: Is the alternating pattern of light and dark squares on the chessboard preserved?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the visible portion of the chessboard still reflects the usual alternating pattern of light and dark squares. This is a typical characteristic of a chessboard and its retention is easily noticeable in the edited image. The artificial elements added, like the fire and magical effects, do not alter the fundamental alternating color scheme of the chessboard.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the king located in the central position of the visible row of black pieces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the piece resembling a king, identifiable by its crown-like top, appears to occupy a position among the central pieces of the visible row. This is corroborated by its relative size and distinct shape compared to the surrounding pieces, adhering to the typical representation of a king in chess sets.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there exactly two bishops, two knights, and at least four pawns visible in their original positions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, only one bishop is visible to the right, and no knights are discernable. The image includes multiple pawns, but without knights, it does not match the expected starting arrangement which would typically include two of each type of minor piece. The arrangement deviates from the original positions for a complete set as required for this criteria.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the shadows of the chess pieces extend diagonally toward the bottom-left of the frame?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no evidence of shadows extending diagonally toward the bottom-left due to the dark and mystical background. The image instead features fiery and luminous effects around the pieces, which might alter typical shadow directions and their presence given the implied luminous sources.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the wood grain texture of the chessboard surface visible across the light squares?",
    "explanation": "Image B maintains the appearance of a wooden surface for the chessboard, with clear and visible wood grain patterns, especially across the lighter squares. This matches the expectation for a textured wood surface, despite the editing to add special effects.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a blurred background with horizontal structural lines visible behind the chessboard?",
    "explanation": "Unlike Image A, Image B features a dark, dramatic background primarily composed of shadows and mystical effects with an absence of distinct horizontal structural lines present behind the chessboard.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are there exactly eight black chess pieces visible in the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, after counting the visible chess pieces, there are a total of eight black chess pieces in view, which aligns with the original set quantity typically shown in the specific portion of the chessboard in the frame.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Is the background of the image blurred while the foreground pieces are in sharp focus?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background is not blurred in the traditional sense but is instead stylized to present a mystical and dark theme with ethereal effects. The foreground pieces remain in sharp focus, displaying clear detail, characteristic of storytelling or thematic imagery rather than standard depth of field effects.",
    "answer": "No"
