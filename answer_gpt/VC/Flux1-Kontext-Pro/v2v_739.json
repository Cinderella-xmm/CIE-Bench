      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes almond-shaped with a downward gaze, maintaining their original proportion and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited version features the subject with a blurred face making it impossible to determine any eye shape, gaze, proportion, or orientation. Therefore, based on visual cues alone, the presence of almond-shaped eyes with any gaze cannot be confirmed.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the nose present with a visible bridge and tip, positioned centrally between the eyes and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has blurred the facial features, including the nose, making it impossible to verify the presence or positioning of the nose, bridge, or tip. Therefore, based solely on visual inspection, it cannot be confirmed.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the mouth have a subtle upward curve at the corners, forming a gentle smile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face in Image B is blurred, rendering any detailed examination of the mouth shape and expression impossible. A subtle upward curve or gentle smile cannot be verified visually.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the subject seated cross-legged with knees bent and body leaning forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is indeed seated with knees bent. The body leans slightly forward, fitting the typical 'cross-legged' posture description. Visual cues confirm this seating posture.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a small gold stud earring visible in the left ear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the subject with a blurred face where the ears might also be affected by the blur; however, the edited details indicate visible large ornate earrings rather than small studs. Therefore, gold stud earrings are clearly not visible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the skin tone light to medium with natural undertones, consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image A features light to medium natural skin tones, Image B displays a stylized version with colors possibly artistically enhanced and does not clearly present natural skin reflectance in a realistic context. Hence, it departs from the originalâ€™s subtleness.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the head tilted downward with the gaze directed forward and slightly down?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the blurred effect on the face, the body posture suggests a downward tilt, consistent with the gesture of looking at a phone. The head seems to be oriented forward and slightly down, matching the behavior described.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
