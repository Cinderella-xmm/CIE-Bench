      "question": "Does the sparrow retain its distinct brown, white, and black feather patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow displays a consistent pattern of brown, white, and black feathers, which is typical for sparrows. Its head has a brown coloration, while its underside is predominantly white, and there are distinct black markings around its eye and throat. Common knowledge of sparrow taxonomy includes recognition of these feather patterns as characteristic of sparrows. Comparing to Image A, the sparrow in both images retains these feather patterns without significant alteration.",

      "question": "Is the sparrow's beak shape and size consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow's beak appears pointed and proportional to its head, which is characteristic of sparrows. This is important for their feeding habits. When comparing with Image A, the shape and proportions of the beak remain unchanged, maintaining consistency with what would be expected from this species. Therefore, the beak is consistent in shape and size in both images.",

      "question": "Is the sparrow still perched on the top rail of the chair in the same upright posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow is positioned on the top rail of the chair, appearing upright with its body resting comfortably on the flat surface, which is typical behavior observed when sparrows perch for stability. Comparing with Image A, the posture remains unchanged as it is perched on the same part of the chair with a similar stance, indicating the sparrow maintains an upright posture in both images.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the chair retain its simple design with vertical slats and horizontal rails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For Image B, the chair has a straightforward design, characterized by vertical slats between horizontal crosspieces, which provides structural support and functionality. This design is common for chairs intended for practical use and aesthetic simplicity. Upon comparison with Image A, the design elements like vertical slats and horizontal rails are retained in the edited image without modification.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sparrow's feet visibly gripping the chair's top rail as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the sparrow's feet clasped onto the top rail of the chair, demonstrating its grip. Sparrows typically use their feet to secure themselves on perches while balancing. Upon reviewing Image A, the sparrow's feet are also gripping the chair similarly. Thus, the manner in which the sparrow's feet grasp the chair in both images is consistent and unchanged.",
