      "question": "Is the classical archway with ornate carvings present and maintaining its original shape and position in the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no classical archway with ornate carvings visible. Instead, the image is set on a simple wooden shelf. Hence, Image B does not feature the classical archway, which is visible in Image A as an architectural element with intricate designs. Without such an element in Image B, the archway does not maintain its original shape and position.",

      "question": "Is the Corinthian column capital with acanthus leaf detailing visible and correctly positioned beneath the spherical perch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a round ornamental object bearing some intricate designs serving as a perch for the pigeon, but there is no visibility of a Corinthian column capital with acanthus leaf detailing. Image A shows such a capital beneath the spherical perch. The absence of the Corinthian column capital in Image B indicates it is neither visible nor positioned beneath the spherical perch.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the perch located directly on top of the Corinthian column capital, maintaining its original vertical alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The perch in Image B is directly on a wooden spherical ornament, which resembles carvings similar to those expected in a Corinthian column capital but lacks authentic architectural alignment or details like those in Image A. In Image A, the perch is directly on top of an ornate column capital, maintaining a vertical alignment indicative of classical columns. Therefore, the perch does not maintain its original position as there is no Corinthian column capital to align with in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the tall fluted column on the left and the distant spired buildings visible in their original positions and silhouettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are wooden architectural models on a shelf, but they lack resemblance to the skyscraper-like spired buildings visible in the distance of Image A. There is also no tall fluted column present as observed in Image A. The placement and design drastically differ, indicating that the columns and spired buildings are neither in their original positions nor silhouettes in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the sky depicted as bright blue with scattered white cumulus clouds, matching the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B provides an indoor scene enclosed by wooden shelves, thus lacking any depiction of the sky or clouds. Image A has a bright blue sky with scattered cumulus clouds, whereas the absence of outdoor elements in Image B denotes the sky is not depicted in the same manner as Image A.",

      "question": "Are the floral and scroll carvings on the arch and column frame present and accurately rendered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not present any floral or scroll carvings on architecture similar to Image A. The ornament behind the pigeon in Image B is of wooden construction with simplistic adornments, contrasting with the detailed architectural carvings seen in Image A. As a result, the floral and scroll carvings are absent and not rendered in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pigeon in Image B is oriented sideways with its head turned slightly toward the viewer, maintaining consistency with the posture seen in Image A. Both images show the pigeon in a similar position, presenting its profile with a slight head turn towards the observer, maintaining this posture.",
