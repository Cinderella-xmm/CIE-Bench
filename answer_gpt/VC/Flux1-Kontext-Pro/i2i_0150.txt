    "Question": "Q1: Does the bird retain its bright yellow plumage with orange accents on its wings and tail?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's plumage is bright yellow, maintaining consistency with the typical appearance of such a bird. The visual cues indicate that the bird has retained its distinctive coloration. Without needing to compare to Image A, we can see the bird has the consistent yellow and orange tones often seen in similar species; this consistency is inferred from general knowledge of bird coloring.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the bird depicted as perched, even if on a different surface like a balcony railing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is clearly perched on a balcony railing. The visual cues, such as the bird's posture and the railing it is perched upon, indicate this. Using world knowledge, birds often perch to rest or observe their surroundings, and the stance shown in Image B accurately corresponds to such behavior.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the bird still have an open beak showing a pink interior?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's beak is visibly open, showing a pink interior. This is discernible from the color contrast between the yellow plumage and the pink inside the beak. The physical appearance of an open beak correlates with common bird behaviors, such as singing or calling, which is consistent with what is observed in the image.",

    "Question": "Q5: Are the bird's claws shown gripping a surface in a manner consistent with perching?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's claws are depicted gripping the balcony railing effectively.
