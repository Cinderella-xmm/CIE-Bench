      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial structure as presented is not visible due to the blurred region covering the face, which prevents analysis of any features such as eyes, nose, beard, and smile. Therefore, without being able to analyze these elements, we cannot conclusively say they are preserved exactly as in the original image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the blurred area covering the upper facial features that typically indicate gaze, it is not possible to determine the direction of the subject's gaze in Image B.",
