      "question": "Does the image retain the warm red and gold color palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues indicate a warm color palette, predominantly composed of rich red and gold tones. This can be seen in the red and gold elements of the LEGO-like figure and the pitcher inside the case, which matches the warmth typical of these colors. This reflects a continuation of the palette seen in classical or vintage-themed compositions, which often emphasize red and gold for a rich, inviting appearance.",

      "question": "Is the wooden surface texture and tone preserved in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the base of the display case and the visible part of the table retain a wooden surface with a consistent texture and tone. This suggests that the photograph was arranged to maintain the warmth and organic texture that wood surfaces offer, often lending a natural and classical feel to a setting.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the reflective qualities of metallic surfaces retained in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic pitcher within the display case shows reflections on its surface. This suggests that the reflective nature of the metal is still present, highlighting the lustrous quality common to metallic objects. Reflection is expected to be visible on a polished metal surface under adequate lighting.",

      "question": "Is the textured appearance of the book cover retained in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination of Image B, the book itself isn't present; instead, there is a LEGO-like figure. Hence, there is no textured book cover to analyze, making it logically deducible that the specific feature was not retained in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the background feature a gradient transition from deep amber to soft cream tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to be largely uniform, resembling a continuous tone rather than a gradient transitioning from deep amber to cream. This choice creates a more neutral backdrop for the display case contents, contrasting with the multi-shade transitions typically seen in a gradient.",
