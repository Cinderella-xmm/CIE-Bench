      "question": "Is the Nikon branding visible and legible in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera's branding area shows the text 'Niikon,' which is very close to the 'Nikon' brand name but not perfectly accurate. To evaluate legibility, world knowledge of written language applies, identifying that transposed 'i' may lead to misinterpretation but is generally recognizable as an attempt to represent Nikon. By comparing to Image A, which clearly shows 'Nikon,' it's evident Image B intends to represent the brand but fails in precise legibility.",

      "question": "Is the lens positioned centrally on the camera body in the steampunk illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lens is located in the central area of the camera body, depicted by the symmetrical placement and surrounding elements balanced around it. World knowledge of camera design indicates that the lens generally occupies the central position for structural and functional purposes. Comparing to Image A, which features the lens in the central location of the camera body, confirms Image B maintains this positioning accurately.",

      "question": "Is the tripod still visibly connected to the camera through a central mount?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the camera atop a tripod, indicating the connection point centrally aligned under the camera, utilizing visual cues that reinforce typical tripod-camera interfaces. World knowledge of photography equipment suggests tripods connect cameras centrally via mounts for stability. Compared to Image A, where the camera is visibly attached to the tripod through a central connection, Image B retains this characteristic.",

      "question": "Are the relative proportions of the camera body, lens, and tripod maintained in the steampunk rendition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera body, lens, and tripod are visually proportionate to each other, as seen in the design maintaining typical dimension ratios known in photographic gear. The camera does not overly dominate the tripod nor does the lens look outsized, consistent with expected scaling. Compared to Image A where these proportions are naturally balanced, Image B appears to retain proportionate exaggeration commensurate with stylized art.",

      "question": "Does the illustration retain a clear depiction of metallic textures on the camera and tripod?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera and tripod exhibit vintage-style illustrated textures that aim to simulate metallic surfaces, depicting highlighted edges and color gradients reminiscent of metal in steampunk art. World knowledge of metallic characteristics in illustration suggests such textures emulate real metallic finishes via shine and color gradient effects. In contrast, Image A demonstrates real metallic textures through photographic realism, whereas Image B renders them illustratively, aligning with artistic interpretation but lacking the machine precision.",
