      "question": "Is the golden-brown crust of the pie slice present with visible crumbly texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pie slice illustration shows a golden-brown crust, which is drawn with a smooth appearance typical of illustrations. However, it lacks a high level of detail such as the crumbly texture that is commonly seen in real photographic depictions. This smoothness is a common trait in cartoon or graphic representation of food items.",

      "question": "Is the dark purple-blue berry filling with visible burst spots present in the pie slice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The berry pie slice in Image B is depicted with a dark purple filling, but it lacks the realistic approach of visible burst spots found in Image A. Instead, the illustration uses solid coloration without intricate texturing, which is typical for stylized illustrations.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration of the pie does include what appears to be a single mint leaf on top, consistent with the depiction in Image A. Although the leaf in the illustration is less detailed, its presence is clear.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the pie slice on a circular plate that visually appears white. This matches the serving style of the pie slice on the white circular ceramic plate as seen in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mug is illustrated with a handle on the right side similar to Image A, but there is no visible tea bag string hanging over the rim in the illustration. Instead, the mug is decorated with a facial expression, which symbolizes anthropomorphism often found in cartoon graphics.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a designed background primarily focusing on a white and peach color scheme for its layout, with no depiction of a gray tabletop surface. This contrasts with Image A, where the setting is visibly on a matte gray surface.",
