      "question": "Is the scientist depicted with her right hand holding a pipette or similar instrument, angled toward the test tubes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scientist is shown holding an instrument similar to a pipette with her right hand. The tool is angled toward the direction of the test tubes, which is a typical practice in a laboratory setting when a scientist is drawing or transferring liquid samples. This observation is consistent with common laboratory scenarios, indicating the answer is 'Yes.'",

      "question": "Are there multiple test tubes arranged in metal racks, containing teal or greenish-blue liquid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, multiple test tubes are clearly arranged in metal racks. The liquid within these test tubes is colored in shades of teal or greenish-blue, which are visible and consistent across the test tubes. This is a common depiction in laboratory environments where scientists work with chemicals or solutions. Hence, the answer is 'Yes.'",

      "question": "Is there a microscope visible on the right side of the workbench, with an eyepiece and stage clearly defined?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, there is no microscope visible on the workbench. Instead, there are digital screens and other technological equipment depicted. No component resembling an eyepiece or stage of a microscope is present. Therefore, the answer is 'No.'",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two digital screens in the background that are displaying circular, intricate patterns. These patterns are symmetrical and appear to be molecular or crystalline, using blue-green tones to present a scientific theme. This typical depiction coincides with the context of a high-tech laboratory, confirming the answer is 'Yes.'",

      "question": "Does the scientist wear a white lab coat and round-framed glasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scientist is depicted wearing a white lab coat, which is standard attire for laboratory work signifying professionalism and safety. The scientist is also wearing round-framed glasses, which are clear from her profile view. The presence of both these elements confirms the answer is 'Yes.'",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the liquids in the test tubes colored in shades of teal or greenish-blue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The test tubes in Image B contain liquids that are vividly colored in shades of teal or greenish-blue. This color choice aligns with scientific aesthetic representations and is consistent throughout the image. The visual confirmation aligns with the given conditions, leading to the answer 'Yes.'",

      "question": "Is the scientist positioned in front of the test tubes, with the microscope to her right and digital screens behind her?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scientist is positioned prominently in front of the test tubes. However, there is no microscope visible to her right. Instead, there are digital screens, which are indeed displayed behind her. Given the absence of a microscope and the presence of digital screens, the correct answer is 'No.'",
