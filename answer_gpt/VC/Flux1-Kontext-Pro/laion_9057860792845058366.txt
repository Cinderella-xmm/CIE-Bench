{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the robot in the same dynamic standing pose, with the left arm slightly raised and the body angled toward the viewer?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pose of the robot, including the slightly raised left arm and its posture, gives off a dynamic appearance, which is a standard design practice for showcasing robots as maneuverable and active. The posture closely aligns with what was visually captured in Image A, confirming that the stance has not been modified.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the primary colors of the robot—white, gray, red, and orange—preserved in their original distribution and intensity?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robot exhibits a more subdued color scheme leaning toward gray tones with a less vibrant appearance, which does not align with a traditional white, red, and orange palette typical of brightly colored mechs. A comparison with Image A reveals a significant deviation in color distribution and vibrancy. The edited image showcases different environmental effects altering the appearance.",
    "answer": "No"
