    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the golden tufted grasses clustered around the base of the cactus still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there isn't a cactus but rather a metallic, spider-like object with no grasses clustered around it. Based on the visual cues, there are no clustered plants seen like those in Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the blue-gray succulent plants visible at the base of the cactus in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metal object is on sand and there are no succulent plants visible. Succulents generally have a distinctive fleshy appearance, whereas the object shown does not display such characteristics.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the sandy ground with visible pebbles and soil texture still present beneath the cactus in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, displays a sandy desert ground beneath a metal object, with no visible cactus or detailed ground texture like pebbles. The sand appears consistent but lacks any detailed texture.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the reddish-brown rolling hills visible in the background behind the cactus in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B's background, the desert extends more uniformly with only sand dunes present. The hills compositionally differ from Image A's detailed landscape presentation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sky gradient from pale blue near the horizon to deeper blue overhead still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a blue sky, but lacks the distinct gradient observed in Image A. By understanding environmental gradients, the transition in Image A from light to dark blue isn't visible in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the shadow of the cactus cast directly beneath it, aligned with the direction of midday sunlight, in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a metallic object casting a shadow, but the absence of a cactus renders the specific shadow description invalid. Shadows are cast according to available light sources, and the outcome here does not match the cactus scenario.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the upright, multi-armed silhouette of the cactus with a central trunk and multiple upward arms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features an angular, metallic structure compared to Image A's natural cactus. The silhouette is significantly transformed, from organic arms to mechanical limbs typical of machinery instead of plants.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
