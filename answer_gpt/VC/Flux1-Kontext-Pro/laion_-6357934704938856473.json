      "question": "Are the red eye lenses present in the head of the robot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot features a head with distinct facial elements, including red eye lenses. These lenses are commonly used in robot designs to give the appearance of eyes, which often indicates the visual sensors or cameras for the robot. The presence of this feature in the design suggests that it's meant to simulate a face, complete with eyes. This observation is based solely on the visible details without needing to refer to Image A.",

      "question": "Are there three orange circular thruster nozzles on each foot of the robot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each foot of the robot has three distinct circular structures which resemble thrusters. The color orange is commonly used to signify active or powered-up areas, particularly in mechanical and robotic designs. The choice of three structures likely indicates a focus on balanced and powerful propulsion capabilities. This finding is derived from analyzing Image B alone for apparent visual elements.",

      "question": "Is a long, straight sword being held in the robot’s left hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the robot with its left hand grasping a long, straight sword. This sword is likely designed as a weapon for the robot, which is a common feature in many robot designs for combat purposes. The shape of the sword is straight and has a sharp appearance, consistent with typical sword designs. This observation can be made solely by inspecting Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there two wing-like structures on the back of the robot, each with an orange tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot is equipped with two notable wing-like structures attached to its back. Each of these structures prominently features a triangular shape with an orange tip, which is likely an aesthetic accent or functional element to differentiate the design. Wing-like appendages are often utilized in robotics for flight or maneuverability. The observation is made independently from Image B without referencing Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot holds a long rifle in its right hand. This object has characteristics typical of gun designs, such as a barrel for firing projectiles, which can be deduced from the shape and structure visible in the image. Rifles are commonly used as weaponry in robot depictions for combat or defense. This conclusion is drawn from Image B's visual information alone.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the robot primarily colored in gray and white with orange accent markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the robot with a color scheme primarily composed of gray and white. The robot also features orange accent markings on parts like the tips of the wings and thruster nozzles, which are likely used for visual emphasis or stylistic contrast. This color palette is often chosen to convey a modern and technological aesthetic. This determination is based entirely on the observation of Image B.",

      "question": "Is the robot posed with one leg bent forward and the other extended backward, suggesting forward motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot is not positioned in a dynamic stance with one leg bent forward and the other extended backward to suggest motion. Instead, it is standing relatively straight within a box-like frame, likely for display purposes. No indicators of forward motion are present. This conclusion is drawn from examining the static positioning shown in Image B.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottom-left corner of Image B contains the text \"©SOTSU·SUNRISE\", which is visible and typically indicates a copyright belonging to the creators or rights holders of the image content. Such markings are commonly used to assert rights and ownership of artistic works, and their placement in the image is confirmed by examining Image B.",
