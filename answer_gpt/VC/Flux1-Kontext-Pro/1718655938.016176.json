      "question": "Is there a cross at the very top of the church's steeple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, we observe a tall, thin steeple on the church, and at its point, there's a small cross silhouette. This is a common feature in church architecture to signify the religious nature of the building. Thus, the presence of a cross is affirmed by these visual cues.",

      "question": "Is there a glowing arched doorway located at the front center of the church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front center of the church clearly depicts an arched doorway that appears to be illuminated from the inside, emitting a warm glow. This glow gives the impression that lights are turned on inside the church, which is a typical portrayal of a welcoming church entrance.",

      "question": "Is there a winding dirt path extending from the foreground toward the church’s entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, a winding dirt path is visible leading from the foreground right up to the church’s doorstep. This path is natural-looking and meanders through the grass, guiding the viewer’s eye towards the entrance of the church, which is consistent with common designs where paths welcome visitors into buildings.",

      "question": "Is there a large arched stained-glass window positioned directly above the main entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, above the glowing arched doorway, there is a prominent window with distinct multicolored sections, typical of stained glass. The window is large and arched, positioned directly above the entrance, which aligns with traditional church designs that feature decorative stained-glass windows above the main doors.",

      "question": "Are there two narrow windows flanking the main doorway and one additional window visible on the side wall of the church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the church's facade with a central doorway, but there are no two narrow windows directly flanking this door. Instead, there are single windows on the wall sides. Additionally, on the visible side wall of the church, there is one narrow window. Therefore, this layout does not match the description given in the question.",
