      "question": "Does the transformed book retain a rectangular shape with visible binding and page structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book maintains its rectangular form as seen from the spine and the edge of the cover, which visually suggests binding. The edges are straight, supporting the idea of a rectangular shape. Commonly, books are bound in such a manner where the spine and covers are discernible, contributing to the overall rectangular appearance. This is consistent with common book structures.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The quill in Image B appears to have a feathered shaft and a tapered tip as expected of a traditional writing quill.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The inkwell in Image B clearly shows a round container with a dark substance inside, indicating ink. This is typical for an inkwell, which is designed to hold ink for use with a quill. The container shape holds the liquid while allowing for the convenient dipping of a quill.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book, quill, and inkwell are arranged close together in an organized fashion under a dome. This suggests an intentional setup for writing, as these items are traditionally associated with each other for this purpose. The proximity of the items supports their function together as a set of writing tools.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The diorama in Image B has a clear vintage feel, with the use of dark wood as the base and brass elements in the candlestick and other details. The worn appearance of the book and the parchment further adds to this aged look, creating an overall vintage aesthetic that suggests historical or antique elements.",
