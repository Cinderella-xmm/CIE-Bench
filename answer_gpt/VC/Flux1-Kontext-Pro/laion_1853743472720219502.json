    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the wooden surface with visible grain patterns and warm brown tones present and unaltered in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden background is visible with a distinct plank pattern but appears more stylized and saturated compared to typical natural wood grain. The wood's appearance aligns more with artistic rendering rather than an unaltered natural look. Such stylization reflects deliberate enhancement to fit an artistic theme, suggesting alterations from an original or natural condition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the two feather pendants positioned such that one is in the foreground and the other is partially overlapped behind it, maintaining the original diagonal alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a single large phoenix pendant is visible, centrally placed, with no indication of two separate feather pendants. There is no overlap or diagonal alignment suggestive of multiple pendants. The appearance and placement of the objects are notably different from a fore-and-background alignment of feather pendants.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the pendants cast soft, consistent shadows beneath them on the wooden surface, indicating overhead lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image (B), the lighting is dramatic and intentional, casting glow-like effects rather than distinct shadows. The artistic style emphasizes luminous effects associated with the phoenix motif rather than realistic shadow casting from pendants.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the pendants aligned diagonally across the frame, extending from the lower-left toward the upper-right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a prominent phoenix pendant centrally placed, in contrast to a diagonal alignment of pendants. The arrangement does not suggest a diagonal placement but rather a vertical -centered display. The configuration departs from any diagonal orientation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the wooden surface retain its natural grain texture, including variations in tone and minor imperfections, without digital smoothing or enhancement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden surface in Image B shows a smoother and more artistically rendered finish compared to a natural texture with grain imperfections. The artistic adjustments present in the background tend to smoothen and saturate the wood's surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the edge of the leather feather clearly defined against the wooden surface, showing a slight separation and shadow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no indication of a leather feather amidst the phoenix-themed pendant. The pendant is fully integrated into the background with effects emphasizing light and fire, without distinct separations or shadowing as expected with a natural object on a different surface.",
