      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the parking meter maintain its black cylindrical shape and color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parking meters are observed to retain their original black cylindrical shape and color. Parking meters are commonly designed to be cylindrical for practical and aesthetic reasons, and despite any changes or edits, these characteristics appear unchanged.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the coin slot visible on both parking meters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, both parking meters clearly display coin slots. From a structural perspective, coin slots are key features of traditional parking meters, and Image B maintains this feature visibly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the digital display on the right parking meter unchanged and labeled \"1995\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the digital display on the right parking meter remains showing '1995.' This consistency may suggest that no changes were made to this portion of the meter, maintaining its original function and display consistency with Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the scene background, including the sidewalk, street, cars, and buildings, consistent with the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B, including elements like the sidewalk, street, cars, and buildings, maintains consistency with Image A. There are no noticeable alterations to these components, indicating that the edits were primarily focused on the meters themselves rather than the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the numbers on the left meter (\"20487\") still present in some form, like being part of the robotic dog's design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the specific number '20487' does not appear on the left meter or as part of any design features, such as the robotic dog, indicating they have been replaced or obscured during editing.",
