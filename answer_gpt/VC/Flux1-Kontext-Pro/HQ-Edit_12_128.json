    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the clock face circular and positioned in the center of the wooden frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a clock made entirely of a glass-like material. The clock face is clearly circular and centrally positioned within the frame. This is a classic design element for such clocks, which ensures symmetry and balance. The placement in the center is visually apparent from the image and follows traditional clock design patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the Roman numerals arranged in clockwise order from I to XII around the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Roman numerals are visible around the clock face. They are arranged in the expected clockwise fashion from I to XII, which is a standard design for both traditional and modern clocks. This arrangement allows for intuitive reading of time.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the pendulum hang directly below the clock face, supported by two vertical rods?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a pendulum extending from the base of the clock. It is connected by thin, vertical rods that align directly below the circular clock face, indicative of a traditional clock mechanism design where the pendulum swings freely beneath the clock.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there two fluted columns, one on each side of the clock face, extending from the top to the bottom of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock in Image B features clear side structures resembling columns, flanking each side of the clock face. However, they do not appear heavily fluted or particularly intricate compared to traditional wooden frames, possibly due to the glass material. Instead, they grant a cleaner, modern aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an ornate element at the top center of the frame that resembles a decorative crest with floral and leaf-like motifs. This top element enhances the clockâ€™s aesthetic and is typical for ornamental timepieces, adding an elegant touch to the overall design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central part of the clock face includes intricate patterns, but it does not have a defined, separate circular medallion distinct from the clock itself. The details are more blended with the overall design, unlike some clocks that feature a prominent center medallion.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock frame lacks rounded feet or any protrusions extending from its bottom corners. Instead, the bottom part is sleek and uniform, typical of suspended wall clocks without additional supporting structures.",
