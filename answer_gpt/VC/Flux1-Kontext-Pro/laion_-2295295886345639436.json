      "question": "Is the mouth wide open in a roaring expression with visible teeth and tongue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the three figures are standing in a calm and static pose, each representing different eras of human depiction. The expressions of these figures are not the focus of this image, as the emphasis is on their body types and attire related to the theme of strength evolution through time. There is no visible indication of any figure displaying a wide-open mouth with a roaring expression showing teeth and tongue. Given the thematic representation and typical portrayal of such characters in this context, the faces, albeit blurred, are likely neutral or expressionless.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the eyes narrowed and focused, indicating anger or exertion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are characterized by their attire and physical presence rather than facial expressions, which are not discernible due to blurring. Generally, depictions of strength or focused exertion might display narrowed eyes for emphasis, but in this image, attention is on the body and clothing. Moreover, the face region is blurred, making it impossible to ascertain any specific focus or emotional state from the eyes. Therefore, based on the context and visual presentation, the eyes do not appear to have an expression of being narrowed or focused.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the head have a balding crown with hair along the sides and back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures appear to represent stereotypical constructs from different eras: antiquity, feudal era, and contemporary weightlifting. While detailed hair styles are not discernible due to the blurred face regions, each figure is depicted with typical hair styles reflecting their respective era's ideals. The lack of visible indications of a balding crown with hair along the sides and back should be noted with the context in mind. Such features are typically associated with specific historical or character profiles unlikely to align with these idealized representations.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the jawline strong and angular, with a defined chin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration depicts muscular and robust characters representing different epochs, with each figure's body embodying traits of strength. Although facial features are blurred, the body-centric focus suggests typically strong and angular physiques, extending to the face for the style of representation likely. The era models often incorporate strong jawlines and defined chins to align with the depiction of physical dominance, a common trait in such stylized illustrations.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the head located at the top center of the figure, aligned with the spine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are drawn with standard proportions where the head is centrally aligned atop the shoulders with the spine, a common practice in balanced and anatomically correct human illustrations. Given the symmetrical and idealized portrayal of strength evolution through time, the central and top-aligned positioning of the head aligns with conventional representation standards.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the face clean-shaven, without a beard or mustache?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the blurring of the face regions in Image B prevents a definitive inspection of facial hair, the various epochs—the ancient, medieval, and modern—suggest diverse traditional facial hair norms. However, considering the idealized and stylized depiction focused on physicality and typical portrayal themes, it's plausible that the faces would be depicted clean-shaven to emphasize and maintain focus on the traditional elements of physical strength over specific facial hair. The absence of visible facial hair is consistent with this artistic approach.",
