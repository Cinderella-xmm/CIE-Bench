    "Question": "Q1: Is the circular gold-tone MK logo charm present and clearly visible on the model’s attire or accessories?",
    "explanation": "To determine the presence of the circular gold-tone MK logo charm, I examine the visual aspects of Image B. The visual cues, such as accessories or attire details, should reflect this charm distinctly. Based on Image B, there is no indication of attire or accessories, as the image is completely black. Therefore, considering common visual occurrences of charms on attire or accessories is irrelevant here, as there is no such reflection in Image B.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is a zippered pocket with a gold-tone pull visible on the side of the model’s dress or outfit?",

    "Question": "Q6: Are the curved handle shapes reflected in the model’s arm or posture alignment?",
