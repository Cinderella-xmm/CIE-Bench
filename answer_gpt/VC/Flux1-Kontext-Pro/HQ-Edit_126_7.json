      "question": "Is the wooden windowsill with visible grain and paneling along the lower edge present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a fluffy, winged cloud creature against a sky background. There is no indication of indoor elements like a wooden windowsill, as seen in Image A. My reasoning was based on understanding that the setting in Image B is strongly sky-related, making it improbable for indoor features to appear.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sheer white curtains draped to the left side of the window visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is entirely set against a sky backdrop. The context and visual cues of Image B contradict the presence of any interior decor like curtains, as the image's focus is entirely on the creature and clouds. The reasoning involves associating the absence of curtain-related features with an outdoor/open sky setting.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the window frame with vertical lines and glass panes visible behind the cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given the setting in Image B shows clouds and a sky environment behind the creature, there are no indicators of any window frame, vertical lines, or glass panes. This reasoning aligns with recognizing the environment as open-air, rather than indoor with window features.",
      "weight": 2,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is set entirely in a blue sky full of clouds surrounding the creature. This background does represent a clear sky condition but it does not suggest it is viewed through a window, instead it is the direct sky environment. My reasoning combined the visual sky features with the outdoor environment context.",
      "weight": 2,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of a cat or associated features such as a knitted blanket. The scene does not include elements likened to a blanket but focuses solely on the sky and cloud creature. This inference was made by observing entirely different visual components and context from Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, contrary to Image A, showcases a creature floating in an open sky, thus sunlight rays specifically on a windowsill and their shadows are absent. My reasoning correlated the lack of indoor setting elements with the outdoor scene depiction.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain a cat; instead it shows a fluffy creature amidst clouds. Visually, there are no feline features, particularly curling or resting on a blanket which is a clear transformation from Image A to B. My reasoning was based on creature-type distinction and differing environment features.",
