      "question": "Does the edited image depict exactly eight arms extending from the central head mass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B visually, it clearly depicts an octopus sculpture with a central head mass and eight distinct arms extending from it. This is a common feature of octopuses, aligning with the biological characteristic that they have eight arms. Each arm is visible and discernible by its individual appearance, resulting in a total count of eight arms.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a distinct, rounded central head mass from which all arms originate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central head mass is distinct and rounded, serving as the origin point for all the arms. This structure resembles typical octopus anatomy, where the 'head' or mantle is the primary, rounded body that houses the arms.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the arms exhibit a flowing, undulating arrangement that mirrors the wave patterns of the original ocean scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B shows a sculpture of an octopus, the arrangement of the arms is relatively rigid and lifelike, rather than dynamic or undulating like waves. The static nature of a sculpture doesn't allow for the fluid movement seen in the original ocean scene depicted in Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible surface textures on the sculptures that mimic the original skin's ridges and suction cup patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays an octopus sculpture with visible surface textures such as ridges and detailed suction cups on the arms. These details mimic the natural skin texture seen in octopuses, though they are stylized in the sculpture format compared to Image A. The reflective material and intricate detail do give an appearance similar to these textures.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the sculpture maintain the same general silhouette and proportional relationship between the head and arms as the original octopus?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B show octopuses with similar silhouettes â€“ a proportionate relationship between the central head mass and the arms. Image B maintains this general silhouette with comparable proportions, even though it is stylized as a sculpture. The round head and the symmetric arrangement of arms align with common octopus anatomy seen in Image A.",
