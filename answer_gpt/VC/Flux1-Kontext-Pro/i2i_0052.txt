    "Question": "Q1: Does the image retain the natural wool texture of the sheep?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, visual cues such as the smooth, cartoon-like style of the characters indicate that the natural wool texture is not retained. In chibi or cartoon illustrations, realistic textures are often simplified or not present at all, focusing instead on cute and stylized designs. Therefore, the natural wool texture is not evident in the edited image.",
