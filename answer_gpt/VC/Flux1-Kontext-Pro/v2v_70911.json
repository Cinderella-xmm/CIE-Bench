      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the AXE logo still visible on the container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the container appears to be opened or cracked with a nebula-like explosion emerging from inside. There is no visible logo or branding displayed on the surface of the container, unlike typical product packaging which would clearly show a logo for brand recognition.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the container retain its cylindrical shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object does not exhibit the consistent cylindrical shape typically associated with containers. Instead, the depiction is of an object with a significant portion missing or exploded, showing internal content in an artistic manner, suggesting a loss of its original cylindrical form.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the fiery red and energetic pink hues from the label's explosive design still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a vibrant inner explosion with luminous colors, leaning towards the fiery red and energetic pink spectrum, suggesting the presence of these hues. This creates a dynamic, explosive effect considering the inner content is shown bursting out.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the net weight text (\"NET WT 2.64 OZ (75g)\") still visible on the label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on the explosive visual effect coming from the container, without any text or traditional packaging information visible. This lack of display of common product details like net weight reinforces the artistic explosion theme over standard labeling.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the container depicted as mostly intact, with only a crack allowing the nebula to be seen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the container appears significantly disrupted or shattered, showing a substantial portion revealing an internal explosion. It does not simply have a crack; rather, it is shown as partially opened to allow a clear view of the nebula-like visual effect, indicating more than just a minor crack.",
