      "question": "Are the three triangular windows positioned at the apex of the A-frame roof clearly present and maintaining their triangular shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, there is no A-frame roof visible, nor triangular windows at an apex. What we observe is a glass structure shaped geometrically in a pyramid-like form. This indicates a significant change from the original cabin structure in Image A, where triangular windows would be expected in the roof based on common architectural designs of cabins. Therefore, the specific triangular windows from Image A aren't present in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the cabin structured with a raised deck on the upper level and a garage on the lower level, maintaining the same vertical separation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a completely different structure, composed of glass panels shaped like a pyramid, sitting on a base with arranged stones. There's no evidence of a deck or garage. Image A shows a cabin with a raised wooden deck and a garage below it. Therefore, Image B lacks the cabin's original structure with a vertical separation between the deck and garage.",

      "question": "Is the garage door located on the right side of the lower level, adjacent to the main entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no garage door or main entrance visible. The structure is entirely different, consisting of a glass pyramid on a base. Image A has a garage door on the lower level to the right side and a main entrance visible. Thus, Image B does not contain the garage door adjacent to any main entrance.",

    {

      "question": "Is the cabin symmetric about its central vertical axis, with the roof peak, main entrance, and supporting columns aligned centrally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, symmetry can be observed in the glass pyramid itself, which has a symmetrical shape about its central axis. Image A presents a cabin with symmetry as well, with a centered roof peak and structure, including supporting columns. However, Image B lacks any cabin features, making the comparison to a cabin not applicable.",

      "question": "Are the vertical support columns beneath the deck present and positioned at regular intervals along the front facade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not exhibit any vertical support columns beneath a deck, as the structure is entirely different. It shows a glass pyramid without any feature resembling a deck or support columns. Image A has visible wooden columns regularly spaced under the deck. There are no such features in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any windows. The new structure is composed entirely of glass panels arranged in a prism shape, lacking any identifiable features such as windows, particularly ones placed according to cabin architecture. Image A has a small rectangular window on the lower level. This window is not visible in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an arrangement of small stones surrounding the base of the glass pyramid structure, but not a stone retaining wall made with large boulders. Image A features a retaining wall on the right side of its base made of large irregular stones. This indicates the retaining wall from Image A is not present in Image B.",
