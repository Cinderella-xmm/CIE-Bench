      "question": "Is the kayak still bright yellow in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an illustration of a person in a bright yellow kayak seen in a photograph being held. The color of the kayak is depicted as bright yellow, maintaining the vibrant hue typically associated with kayaks for high visibility. This aligns with the common perception of kayaks having bright colors, especially yellow, to ensure visibility in water.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the black bungee cords in an X-pattern present on both ends of the kayak deck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show the actual kayak deck in detail, as the photo being held shows a stylized figure in a kayak on water and a blurred portion. Without visible black bungee cords in an X-pattern on the kayak deck in the image, combined with the knowledge that the depiction is more symbolic than detailed, it indicates the absence of this specific detail.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a black padded seat visible inside the kayak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts a cartoonish style with minimal detail. It doesn't show a specific black padded seat in the kayak as Image A does. Given the stylized and simplistic nature of the representation, the focus is more on the character and the kayak's overall appearance rather than details like seating.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the skateboard have a dark gray grip tape surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain an image of the skateboard. Instead, it emphasizes a printed photo, and within it, a figure is in focus. The absence of any skateboard representation in this frame means there's no basis to confirm details about its grip tape in this context.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the skateboardâ€™s trucks silver and the wheels tan in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B focuses on a character in a kayak rather than a skateboard, the skateboard is unavailable for evaluation in Image B. Without the subjects of a skateboard or its elements being visible, details such as the color of trucks and wheels can't be verified here.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the kayak and skateboard aligned vertically and placed parallel to each other?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a figurine photo is being held; it does not feature a kayak and skateboard arranged as described. Image A consists of the alignment stated in the question, but in Image B, this configuration is absent due to the different subject matter focused on within the image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Is the background a uniform neutral beige surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of the image in Image B, where the photo is held, appears to be a continuation of the neutral beige surface seen in Image A. This uses the beige color as a non-distracting backdrop highlighting the foreground element, connecting the image's themes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Do both the kayak and skateboard cast soft shadows to their left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The photo held in Image B focuses on a scene and doesn't involve displaying both the kayak and skateboard with visible shadows due to its content focus. Therefore, any shadow analysis related to these objects cannot be performed for this image instance.",
