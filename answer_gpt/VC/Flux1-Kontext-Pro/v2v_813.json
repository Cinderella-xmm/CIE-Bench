      "question": "Is the dark, glossy texture of the chocolate sauce preserved in the sneaker design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sneaker features a combination of brown tones with distinct materials such as leather and fabric. The dark brown overlays have a certain sheen that may resemble the glossy texture of chocolate sauce. The observable reflection and specular highlights on these parts suggest a similarity to the chocolate sauce’s glossy appearance. Therefore, the design captures an element similar to the chocolate sauce’s texture.",

      "question": "Are the flowing, pooling patterns of the chocolate sauce represented in the sneaker’s form or material application?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sneaker's design does not seem to include any elements that mimic the flowing or pooling patterns of the chocolate sauce seen in the edited image. The shoe's structure is defined and segmented, without visible random or flowing patterns akin to liquid chocolate. The patterns and lines in the shoe are more structured and linear, typical of a sneaker design, not resembling the organic flow of sauce.",

      "question": "Does the sneaker incorporate ruffled, organic contours inspired by the lettuce’s shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sneaker in Image B does not display any ruffled, organic contours that reflect the shape of lettuce leaves. The contours and edges of the sneaker are smooth and uniform, without the kind of irregular and wavy lines one would associate with lettuce leaves. The design appears streamlined and consistent with typical sneaker aesthetics, lacking the organic, undulating features present in a leaf.",

      "question": "Is the reflective surface of the chocolate sauce maintained in the sneaker’s material finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the sneaker design shown in Image B, certain parts of the sneaker, like the darker leather sections, have a mild sheen that reflects light, similar to the glossy finish of chocolate sauce. This slight reflectivity suggests a resemblance to the sauce’s reflective surface in terms of material quality, albeit less pronounced.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a clear contrast between dark chocolate-inspired elements and green lettuce-inspired elements in the sneaker design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sneaker design in Image B primarily features varying shades of brown with no elements that reflect the green hue of lettuce, suggesting a thematic focus on chocolate over any vegetable-based design elements. The colors and materials observed make no reference to a green palette such as that of lettuce. Therefore, no chocolate and lettuce-inspired contrast is present in this sneaker.",
