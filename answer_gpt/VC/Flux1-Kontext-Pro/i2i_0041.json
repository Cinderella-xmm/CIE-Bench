      "question": "Do the sheep retain their interaction posture (one feeding the others) in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no realistic sheep as in Image A, but instead, there are three chibi characters wearing hats and scarves. The original interaction, which involved a sheep feeding, is not present due to the artistic and symbolic representation of animals and possibly humans as chibi characters. Therefore, the sheep's interactive posture is not retained in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the green metal railing still placed in the same relative position near the sheep in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts chibi characters with no railing present. Unlike Image A, which has a green metal railing near the sheep, Image B features a cartoon-like drawing with no metal railing, as it is a figurative and stylized representation rather than a literal depiction. Thus, there is no green metal railing in the same or any relative position.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the snowy ground and background indicative of a winter setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a neutral, solid gray, which does not visually represent snow or a winter setting. Image A, conversely, clearly shows a snowy landscape. Image B lacks these seasonal indicators, suggesting an artistic abstraction rather than a continuation of the winter theme.",

    {

      "question": "Are the wooden fences visible in the background of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a simple gray and contains no elements like fences or other environmental details seen in Image A. This indicates a shift from a detailed scene in Image A to a minimalist, character-focused design in Image B.",

      "question": "Do the chibi characters in the edited image retain shapes that clearly resemble sheep?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi characters have features reminiscent of sheep-like characteristics with features such as woolly textures and sheep-like ears, designed to convey a cartoonish version of sheep. Although stylized, they retain enough elements to be identified as inspired by sheep.",
