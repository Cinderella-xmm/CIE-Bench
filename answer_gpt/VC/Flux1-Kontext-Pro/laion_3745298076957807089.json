      "question": "Is the bottle’s main body still a transparent rectangular glass container with softly rounded edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main body of the bottle is a transparent glass container, characterized by a rectangular shape with softly rounded edges. This conclusion is based on the visible shape and texture of the glass that allows for the content inside to be seen, indicating transparency, and the edges are clearly not sharp but rounded. These features are typically associated with such bottles designed for aesthetics and safety.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle is filled with a liquid that exhibits a golden-yellow hue and translucency. This conclusion is drawn from observing the color and clarity of the liquid inside the transparent bottle, which is visible and appears consistent with common liquids like whiskey or similar beverages.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a black box positioned next to the bottle, featuring an arched cutout and displaying gold text at the top and bottom. The presence of the gold text 'CADENHEAD'S' at the top and 'ESTD. 1842' at the bottom is confirmed by the visual elements on the box, matching the description given.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle's surface shows reflections and highlights, which are indicative of the glass's transparency and smooth finish. These visual cues are common signs of a polished glass surface that reflects light, making them visible on the bottle’s exterior.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle is indeed positioned to the left of the box. The arched window cutout on the box is structured to frame the bottle, indicating a deliberate alignment for display purposes. This alignment is often used in product presentation to enhance visual appeal.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the bottle appears flat and thickened, which are characteristics that support stable placement on a surface. This structural design is typical for glass bottles to prevent tipping and ensure a firm placement.",
