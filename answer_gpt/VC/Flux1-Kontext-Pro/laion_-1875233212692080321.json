      "question": "Does the perfume bottle include a shade of pink that matches the \"Rose Pink\" eyeshadow in the original palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle is set against a pink background. To determine if this shade of pink matches 'Rose Pink' from a common eyeshadow palette, I rely on typical descriptions of 'Rose Pink' as a medium-to-dark pink with subtle cool undertones. The pink background in Image B appears consistent with this description, suggesting a close match. Therefore, the pink backdrop of the edited image aligns with the characteristics of a 'Rose Pink' shade.",

      "question": "Is the text \"Anastasia Beverly Hills\" visible on the perfume bottle or its packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle is labeled with the word 'VAEIN.' There is no visible text indicating 'Anastasia Beverly Hills' on the bottle itself or the surrounding area. Analyzing the branding, it appears exclusive to 'VAEIN' without incorporating any other brand names related to cosmetics. This conclusively indicates that the perfume bottle does not feature the 'Anastasia Beverly Hills' text.",

      "question": "Does the perfume bottle feature an external accent in the color \"Burnt Orange\" as seen in the palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 'Burnt Orange' color typically presents as a warm, medium orange with brown undertones. In Image B, the bottle is composed mainly of a rich brown liquid and clear glass, paired with a golden rose cap. Visual inspection does not reveal any orange or burnt orange components externally on the bottle. Consequently, the answer is based on identifying accent colors that are predominantly brown and gold rather than orange.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the perfume bottle standing alone without any additional objects like brushes or beauty tools visible. Given the focus on showcasing the perfume bottle exclusively, there is no inclusion or hint of any makeup brush, including dual-ended ones, within the frame.",

      "question": "Is the background of the image a soft pink gradient matching the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a consistent, solid pink color without any gradient visible. Comparing this to commonly known soft pink gradients—where color transitions smoothly from lighter to darker tones—the absence of such a transition characterizes the background as solid rather than gradient. Thus, it doesn't exhibit a matching soft pink gradient.",
