      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the bite mark present on the right side of the pear-shaped animal, exposing white flesh with an irregular edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pear-shaped object has an indentation but does not show white flesh with an irregular edge. The indentation is more uniform and does not mimic a realistic bite mark exposing flesh. This differs from Image A, where the pear indeed has an irregular bite mark exposing white flesh.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the interior surface of the glass cube display a visible wood grain pattern with a warm brown color matching the original wooden backdrop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the interior of the glass cube does not show any wood grain pattern or color. It is clear and transparent, with no apparent backdrop color, as it encloses the pear-shaped object and figure. This contrasts with Image A, which features a warm wooden backdrop.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the pear-shaped animal retain the small brown speckles across its outer surface, mimicking the original pear’s skin texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the pear-shaped object maintaining small brown speckles across its outer surface, similar to the original pear's russet skin texture in Image A. The speckles give it a realistic pear-like appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is a brown stem present at the top of the pear-shaped animal, extending upward from the narrow end?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a brown stem extending upward from the narrow end of the pear-shaped object, consistent with the stem observed on the pear in Image A. This feature maintains the similarity between the two pear representations.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the pear-shaped animal maintain the classic teardrop silhouette with a narrow neck and broad base, matching the original pear’s outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pear-shaped object in Image B maintains a teardrop silhouette with a narrow neck and broad base, consistent with the shape of the pear in Image A. This silhouette is typical for pears and remains unchanged in both images.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features lighting tones that exhibit warmth, with golden-brown highlights and soft shadows, matching with the color palette seen in the original Image A. This warmth is consistent across both images, creating a cohesive visual atmosphere.",
