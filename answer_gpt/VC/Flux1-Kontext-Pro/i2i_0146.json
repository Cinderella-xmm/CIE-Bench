      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the zebra clearly shows the typical black and white stripes that are characteristic of zebras. These stripes extend vertically and horizontally across its body, legs, and face, a common feature that helps zebras in various ways, including camouflage and social recognition. This pattern is consistently visible, confirming that the stripes are retained.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
