      "question": "Is the smartphone still a silver-colored device with a visible circular home button below the screen and rounded corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smartphone is not silver but appears to be in a darker shade. It lacks a visible circular home button, which is characteristic of older smartphone models. Instead, the screen occupies most of the front side, and rounded corners signify a modern design. This analysis is based on recognizing typical design elements of newer smartphones, which often omit physical buttons for an all-screen display.",

      "question": "Does the laptop retain its silver chassis, black keyboard, and visible trackpad below the keyboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the laptop does appear to maintain the silver chassis and black keyboard. The visible trackpad is positioned below the keyboard as expected in such designs. This analysis draws on understanding common designs for laptops where these elements are standard.",

      "question": "Is the hand anatomically correct with five fingers, visible fingernails, and a natural grip around the phone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand shown holding the smartphone appears anatomically correct with fingers gripping around the phone naturally. The fingers look proportionate, and even though details such as fingernails are not clear, it reflects a natural human grip. This follows common observation of how people comfortably hold smartphones.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the smartphone held directly above the laptop keyboard, with the hand positioned over the trackpad area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the smartphone held above the laptop, but the hand is not positioned over the trackpad area precisely. Instead, the hand appears slightly to the side with the fingers extended onto the laptop's surface, missing the expected trackpad positioning, indicating the hand is primarily interacting with the phone rather than hovering over the laptop controls.",

      "question": "Are horizontal window blinds visible in the background behind the laptop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible horizontal window blinds in the background as observed in Image A. The backdrop is darker, indicative of perhaps a different setting without window blinds visible, reflecting changes possibly to create a futuristic tech atmosphere.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, blue is explicitly dominant on both the smartphone and laptop screens. This is noticeable from the user interface and elements displayed, consistent with blue-themed designs often used in digital and tech contexts for readability and aesthetics.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smartphone screen indeed maintains a rectangular shape with rounded corners. This follows the modern trend of smartphone designs where rounded corners and full-front screens are prevalent for ergonomic and aesthetic reasons.",
