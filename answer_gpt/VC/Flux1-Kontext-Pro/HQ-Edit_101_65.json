    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the subject's facial expression, including a wide smile showing teeth and eyes looking upward to the left, preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's facial area is blurred, so we cannot determine the details of the facial expression or how the eyes and mouth are positioned. The question of a wide smile showing teeth or the orientation of the eyes cannot be answered given the visual information available.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the subject's head turned slightly to the left, maintaining the original angle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurred face does not obscure the overall orientation of the head in Image B. Based on the alignment of the hair and the visible portions of the head, it seems the head maintains a similar angle, slightly turned to the left. Situational context and style consistency with traditional portraiture support this as likely consistent behavior.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the subject's hands clasped gently in front of the torso, with fingers interlaced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hands are positioned in front of the torso, and the fingers appear interlaced, indicating a gentle clasp. Comparing to typical formal portraits, this is a common pose, further suggesting intention to keep such a posture.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the henna designs visible on the subject's palms and fingers preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no visible henna designs on the subject's palms and fingers in Image B. The surface of the hands appears unadorned, which indicates that the henna designs are not preserved.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the subject's natural skin tone and lighting on the face and arms preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arms in Image B show a consistent, natural skin tone with appropriate lighting, while the face area is blurred, so any assessment there cannot be conducted. In general, it seems that the rest of the subject's skin appears to be represented naturally.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the subject's long, wavy brown hair flowing over the shoulders preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hair indeed appears long and wavy, cascading over her shoulders, consistent with traditional styles and visually continuous with the description of wavy brown hair.",
