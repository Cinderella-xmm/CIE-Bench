      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which displays a grid containing nine different book covers, the text 'NEW YORK Guitar Method' appears consistently and prominently on each cover example, including the top left cover where it is presented in white against a green background. The formatting of the text, combined with its strategic placement near the top of each cover, ensures it is legible and easily identifiable to viewers with no apparent distortions or obstructions.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents 'Bruce Arnold' written in a definite manner on each cover within the grid. Specifically, the author's name is placed directly below 'NEW YORK Guitar Method' in a smaller, italicized font, which contrasts adequately against the background color. The consistent positioning across all instances of the book covers within the grid makes the author's name noticeable and readable.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals that 'Ensemble Book 2' is explicitly visible on each cover example within the grid. In Image B, the text is featured at the bottom half of each cover. The placement is near the guitar image, and it is structured with clear alignment and enough contrast relative to each background color, thereby ensuring visibility among all covers presented.",

        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, the 'MUSE EEK' logo is discernible on the right side of each cover example in the grid. This logo, displaying a small diagram that includes a figure and some lines, along with the 'MUSE EEK' text underneath, remains consistent and unobscured across all variations, and thus is present and identifiable.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon reviewing Image B, it is evident that a guitar is positioned diagonally on each cover of the nine-book grid. In each instance, the guitar extends from the bottom left to the top right of the circular area on the cover. This consistent diagonal placement forms a recognizable pattern, contributing to the overall design and thematic cohesion among the book covers.",
