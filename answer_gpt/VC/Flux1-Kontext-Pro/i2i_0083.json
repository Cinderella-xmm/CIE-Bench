      "question": "Are the armchairs upholstered in brown fabric with light wooden legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armchairs are clearly upholstered in a brown fabric. They have a notable texture indicative of fabric material. The legs of the armchairs are made of wood and appear light, natural wood color, which provides a contrast to the darker upholstery, hinting at a polished or untreated light wooden finish. This combination of visual cues and world knowledge on typical armchair materials leads to the conclusion.",

      "question": "Are the armchairs placed symmetrically on either side of the central display area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two armchairs are positioned symmetrically with equal spacing on either side of the central artwork on the wall. Symmetry can be identified by the equal distance between each armchair and the central focus of the artwork above, creating a balanced and aesthetically pleasing arrangement, which is common in interior design practices to provide harmony in a space.",

      "question": "Is the wall behind the armchairs a plain white surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall behind the armchairs appears to be a plain surface with no visible textures or patterns. The color of this surface is white or very close to white based on the way it reflects light and complements the warm tones of the armchairs and floor, creating a neutral backdrop typical in minimalist or modern design spaces.",

      "question": "Does the floor have a glossy polished wood texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floor reflects light suggesting a polished surface typical of varnished wood. The texture visible is consistent with wood grain patterns and the light reflections enhance the perception of glossiness. This indicates a polished wooden floor, which is a popular choice for its aesthetic appeal and easy maintenance.",

      "question": "Are there soft shadows cast beneath the armchairs on the floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area around the base of the armchairs shows variations in tone and shading, indicating the presence of soft shadows. These shadows are subtle and follow the lines of the furniture legs, which provides a realistic effect in a well-lit room, thus confirming the presence of soft shadows underneath the armchairs.",
