}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the ocean visible in the background behind the figures, with waves breaking against rocks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a fantastical seascape with large, dramatic waves, but it doesn't specifically show waves breaking against rocks as in a realistic ocean scene. It is more of an artistically enhanced seascape setting.",

    "Question": "Q4: Are the figures standing on dark, jagged rock formations in the foreground?",

    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the sun positioned directly behind the central figure, creating a bright glow between his legs?",

    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a clear horizon line separating the sky from the ocean in the background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a clear horizon line is not present; instead, the sky seamlessly transitions into the ocean setting without a defined separation, contributing to the overall surreal, fantastical approach of the image.",
