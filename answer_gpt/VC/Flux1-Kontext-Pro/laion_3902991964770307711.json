    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain exactly three arms—one central and two lateral—arranged symmetrically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the candelabra features one central arm and two lateral arms extending symmetrically from the center. This configuration mirrors a common design where each arm is evenly spaced and balanced around the central axis.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the left and right arms symmetrically positioned and shaped relative to the central axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show that both lateral arms have identical shapes and curves, extending outwardly from the central column at equal angles, thus maintaining symmetry relative to the central vertical axis.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the base circular, flared, and adorned with a beaded or ridged edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the base appears to be circular and flares outward at the bottom. Additionally, the base is decorated with a beaded or ridged pattern along the edge, which can be visually identified as per the description.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the central stem remain a tall, tapering vertical shaft connecting the base to the top arms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central stem is depicted as a tall column that progressively tapers as it extends upwards, effectively connecting the base to the arms at the top, which is consistent with the typical structure of a candelabra.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the arms maintain smooth, curved trajectories from the central stem to the top ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the lateral arms exhibit a smooth, curving path from the central stem to their outer ends where the candle holders are situated. This design is characteristic of traditional candelabra, where the arms gracefully arc outwards.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
