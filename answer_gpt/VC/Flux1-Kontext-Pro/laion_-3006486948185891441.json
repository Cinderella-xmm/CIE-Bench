      "question": "Is the left front leg of the horse raised off the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left front leg of the horse is noticeably bent at the knee and positioned in a way that indicates it is raised off the ground. This is a common pose for statues representing horses in motion or in a display stance. The fact that the leg is not parallel with the base and appears to have elevation confirms this observation. Thus, the leg is indeed lifted.",

      "question": "Does the mane flow downward along the neck in long, wavy strands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse’s mane can be seen cascading down the neck in elongated, wavy strands. This flowing texture is typical for representing hair or mane details in sculptures to provide a sense of realism and dynamism. The movement and the length of the strands are evident in the wavy and elongated depiction along the neck.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows the horse's tail draped over the left side of its rear flank. This positioning is typical for sculptures where the tail is intentionally placed to create a sense of motion or balance in the design. The image depicts the tail explicitly resting on the left side, adding to the dynamic posture of the horse.",

      "question": "Are there pleated folds and spherical ornaments on the saddle cloth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the saddle cloth is depicted with visible pleats and spherical ornaments. These features serve not only decorative purposes but also add texture and visual interest to the sculpture. Pleats and ornaments are common in depicting saddle cloths to enhance the elaborate appearance of the horse.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows noticeable patches of red-orange pigment on areas like the saddle and bridle. This pigmentation is typical in ancient sculptures to indicate the ornamentation and details that might have been painted on originally. These traces suggest the sculpture was once more vibrantly colored.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse’s ears appear upright and pointed, as is common in stylized depictions of horses. This positioning is typical of horse representations, showing attentiveness and alertness. The sharply defined shapes effectively create this impression.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From Image B, three of the horse's hooves are solidly fixed to the base, while one front hoof is distinctly lifted. This sort of dynamic stance is typical in sculptures to suggest motion or activity, setting the subject apart from static portrayals.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the horse in Image B reveals signs reflective of wear, characteristic of aging and historical artifacts. Such signs imply that the sculpture is either genuinely old or intentionally made to appear aged, suggesting historical significance or artistic choice.",
