      "question": "Does the image retain the metallic texture and finish of the bearings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bearings have a reflective, shiny surface, indicating a metallic texture. This texture is consistent with what one would expect from metal objects like bearings, which are typically made of steel or a similar metal for durability and function. Thus, the metallic texture and finish are effectively retained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the shape and structural details (rings, grooves) of the bearings accurately represented?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bearings in Image B have clear structural details such as inner and outer rings, and grooves, which are typical characteristics of ball or roller bearings. These details are essential for the functionality of the bearings, and they appear accurately represented in the image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the bearings maintain their relative positions and orientations as shown in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the bearings are placed flat towards the bottom of the image. In Image B, the bearings are organized neatly in a box and a separate standalone example, significantly different from their presentation in Image A where they were simply laid out without any specific order. This indicates a change in their relative positions and orientations between the two images.",

    {

      "question": "Is the text \"Facts You Need to Know about Bearings and Final Drive Motors\" still present on the chalkboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text \"Facts You Need to Know about Bearings and Final Drive Motors\" is visible both on the box and the metallic case. Although the color and texture of these objects differ from the chalkboard in Image A, the text remains consistent across both images.",

      "question": "Does the background remain clean and uncluttered, focusing attention on the bearings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is simple and devoid of any distracting elements, ensuring that the viewer's focus remains on the bearings and the packaging. This is similar to Image A, where the background also serves the primary purpose of highlighting the bearings. Thus, the background remains clean and uncluttered in Image B.",
