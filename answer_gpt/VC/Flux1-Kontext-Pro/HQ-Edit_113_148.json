      "question": "Does the transformed sculpture retain a central tall spire flanked by multiple smaller turrets arranged symmetrically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal sculpture has a central tall spire surrounded by multiple smaller turrets in a symmetrical arrangement. This is determined by observing the structure which maintains a balanced layout, typical of castle designs, where a central point of elevation is accentuated by surrounding towers. This logical organization of architecture aligns with common symmetrical designs found in castles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there small red flags positioned at the tip of each turret of the crystal sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the turrets of the crystal sculpture have flags at their tips, but they are blue instead of red. This conclusion is drawn from examining the details on top of each turret where the flag color is visually noticeable, contrasting against the transparent crystal material, confirming their presence but in a different hue.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the shovel located in the foreground, angled toward the base of the castle, and partially submerged in reflective water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shovel is placed in the foreground near the base of the crystal castle but is not submerged in any reflective water. The shovel is positioned on a display table, which lacks any reflective or water-like surface. Analyzing its environment, the museum setting does not support the presence of water, only a flat surface around the sculpture.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the gemstones (replacing seashells) grouped in a cluster at the foot of the crystal castle, similar to the original shell arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gemstones are dispersed around the base of the castle, resembling the original arrangement found in Image A, where seashells were grouped closely at the base of the sandcastle. Observing their placement, it mimics the natural cluster where seashells would traditionally be gathered near a sand structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the frosted glass slab feature a continuous horizontal wave pattern that mimics the original oceanâ€™s rolling motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the frosted glass slab features a decorative wave element, but it does not show a continuous horizontal wave pattern similar to the rolling ocean in Image A. Instead, it displays a singular wave motif, which contrasts the extensive and repetitive rolling of ocean waves found in beach contexts.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the tallest tower located centrally within the crystal sculpture, rising above all other structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection, Image B presents a crystal sculpture wherein the tallest tower is indeed centrally positioned, prominently elevated above the surrounding turret structures. This position is verified by visual analysis which aligns with typical architectural prominence found in traditional castle designs where a main keep or tower acts as the focal point.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the shovel retain a red blade and yellow handle, even if rendered in crystal or another material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the shovel in crystal form, keeping its design but altering its color, appearing transparent like the rest of the sculpture. While the shape is preserved, the color transformation is evident, leading to a logical conclusion that the red blade and yellow handle are absent in favor of a crystal aesthetic.",
