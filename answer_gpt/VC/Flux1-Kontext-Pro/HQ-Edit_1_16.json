      "question": "Is the bird's eye clearly visible with a dark blue iris, black pupil, and a thin white orbital ring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's eye is depicted prominently, and the details are illustrated in a stylized manner suitable for children's book illustrations. The eye appears to have a dark blue or bluish hue with a distinct black pupil, and there is a thin white ring surrounding it, which is typical in cartoon representations to make the eye stand out and appear expressive. Based on this visual cue, which emphasizes eye details commonly seen in animated or illustrated characters, the description matches what is seen.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the bird have a short, conical beak that is pale pinkish-gray with a dark tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bird in Image B is illustrated with a small, conical beak that is depicted with shades that range from light to dark, giving the beak a dimensional look. The tip appears darker than the base, which is consistent with many small bird species. The coloration can be seen as pale pinkish-gray transitioning to a darker tip, which is a common approach in illustrations to suggest texture and depth.",

      "question": "Are the bird’s feathers visibly fluffy and layered, with warm earthy tones including tan, brown, and reddish crown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bird in Image B is shown with feathers that appear fluffy and soft, which is achieved through layering and shading techniques typical in illustrated animals for children. The color palette used consists of warm, earthy tones such as tan, brown, and a reddish-brown crown which suggests a comforting and natural appearance common in artistic depictions of animals in nature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bird’s tail feathers extend downward in a long, narrow, layered shape with natural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tail feathers of the bird are illustrated in a downward direction. They appear to be long and narrow with layers, achieved through both line and shading. The shading gives a natural look, making the feathers seem realistic in terms of how they might appear in a children’s storybook illustration. This representation focuses on creating flow and depth, typical in such portrayals.",

      "question": "Are the bird’s feet visible with claws gripping the branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the illustration seen in Image B, the bird's feet are clearly visible, and the claws seem to be gripping a surface. However, instead of gripping a branch, as typical in real-life scenarios, they are depicted as being on a map-like surface as part of the artistic setting in the second image. Despite this setting, the depiction suggests the ability to grip in a stylized manner.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the bird positioned upright on the branch, facing slightly to the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the context of Image B, the bird is illustrated to be upright, but unlike perching on a branch, it seems to be standing on a path surface within the cartoonish adventure context. Its body orientation, however, does face slightly to the left, consistent with how animals are often positioned to simulate movement or readiness in adventure illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there green moss visible on the right side of the branch beneath the bird?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background and environment have been crafted to depict a forest scene that fits the adventure theme of the book cover. While various green elements are present, the specific presence of moss on a branch beneath the bird is not part of this artistic illustration as the bird is depicted in a more imaginative setting.",
