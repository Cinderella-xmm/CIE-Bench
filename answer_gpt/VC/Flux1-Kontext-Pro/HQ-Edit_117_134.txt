    "Question": "Q1: Is the lid of the piano open and angled upward, revealing the internal structure?",
    "explanation": "Based on visual analysis of Image B, the lid of the piano is indeed open and angled upward, allowing visibility into the internal structure of the piano. This can be seen by the way the lid is supported by a prop stick, which is standard for grand pianos to facilitate sound projection. The lid is held up in a manner consistent with how grand piano lids are typically arranged.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the piano have four legs, each ending in a golden caster, supporting the body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the piano has four legs; however, they do not appear to end in typical golden casters. Instead, the legs themselves end with decorative golden elements which may resemble feet or detailed craftsmanship but not traditional piano casters as seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are there exactly three pedals positioned in a row beneath the keyboard?",
    "explanation": "The visual analysis of Image B reveals that the piano does indeed have three pedals positioned in a row beneath the keyboard, which is a standard feature in many pianos for controlling sound variation during play.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the keys arranged in the standard piano pattern of alternating white and black keys across the full length of the keyboard?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the keys are arranged in an alternating pattern of small sections of white and black keys which is generally how piano keys are laid out, mimicking the traditional keyboard layout visible in Image A. This satisfies the characteristic identification of a standard piano keyboard pattern.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a music stand attached to the top front edge of the piano body?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not depict a music stand attached to the top front edge of the piano. This part of the piano body is visible, yet absent of any attachment that functions as a music stand, which is contrary to what is often found in concert pianos.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the lid connected to the piano body via a visible hinge mechanism near the rear edge of the keyboard?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not show a visible hinge mechanism explicitly. The connection appears to be more decorative than functional, lacking clear hinges that can typically be seen on grand pianos where the lid is mechanically joined near the keyboard's rear edge.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the piano maintain the same elongated, curved-body silhouette and proportional dimensions as in the original image?",
    "explanation": "Upon comparing Images A and B, it's clear that both pianos share the elongated, curved-body silhouette typical of grand pianos; however, Image B portrays it with a decorative variation and differing dimensions that alter its proportional appearance from Image Aâ€™s standard grand piano proportions.",
    "answer": "No"
