      "question": "Are the black stripes evenly distributed across the body, head, and legs in the same pattern as the original knitted animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited object is a mosaic sculpture with black stripes. The stripes appear regularly distributed across the body, head, and legs. Without comparing to Image A, it is noted that the object in Image B does have evenly spaced stripes. Upon comparing with Image A, the original knitted object has more of a repeated and defined pattern of stripes. Thus, the consistently spaced pattern seen in Image B doesn't completely align with the original due to the mosaic's geometric influence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the snout present with two clearly defined, dark circular nostrils positioned symmetrically on the upper portion of the snout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snout of the mosaic sculpture is modeled with two dark circular spots where nostrils would logically be, positioned symmetrically on the upper portion of the snout, consistent with common depictions of animal nostrils. This matches the general characteristic of defined nostrils also seen in the original Image A's knitted object.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the eyes large, round, and positioned symmetrically on the face, each consisting of a white outer ring and a central black pupil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes of the mosaic sculpture are large and round with a distinct pupil and white surrounding, positioned symmetrically on the face. This characteristic is aligned with Image A, where the original stuffed animal's eyes have a similar shape and symmetry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the mouth a clearly visible curved line forming a smile below the snout, consistent with the original animalâ€™s expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mouth in Image B is depicted as a clearly visible curved line under the snout, giving the appearance of a smile. Upon comparison, Image A shows a similar smiling expression crafted into the knitted animal toy's design, ensuring consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the animal in a walking pose with the left front leg extended forward and the right front leg grounded behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mosaic animal is shown in a static pose with all four legs evenly placed on the ground, which does not indicate a walking posture. Image A shows the knitted animal in a similar static position, not exhibiting a walking motion.",

      "question": "Are there two small, rounded ears positioned symmetrically on top of the head, pointing slightly outward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mosaic sculpture in Image B has two small, rounded ears at the top of its head, positioned symmetrically and slightly outward, consistent with common animal design. This feature is echoed in the original Image A, where the knitted object also has symmetrically placed ears.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the sculpture placed on a surface with a visibly granular, uneven texture resembling natural sand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower portion around the sculpture reveals a granular, uneven texture typical of sand. This sandy texture is visually distinct and suggests a natural sandy surface. Without referring to Image A, this appearance leads to the conclusion that the surface resembles sand.",
