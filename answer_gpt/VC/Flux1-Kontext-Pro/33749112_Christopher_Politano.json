    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the three distinct mountain peaks—two broad and one sharp—present and positioned in the same relative layout as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall mountain formation has been significantly altered to resemble a fantasy creature with two horns. The distinct three mountain peaks, as seen in Image A, have been replaced by this new formation, showing no resemblance or layout to the original peaks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the lake located in the same basin with the same irregular shape, including the curved western edge and shallow extension toward the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a lake with noticeable visual effects, such as a glowing center related to the fantastical theme. The original irregular shape and natural formations like the curved western edge have been modified for artistic effect.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the trails maintain their original routing pattern across the slopes, including their connection to the lake and convergence points?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while some pathways might remain visible, their routing appears drastically altered due to the surrounding artificial structures and landscape design. The original natural trail patterns in Image A have been significantly revised.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any human figures near the shoreline, unlike in Image A where people are noticeable. This aligns with the fantasy rendition that avoids mundane elements like human figures.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "is_correct": false
    },

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the sky clear blue with scattered wispy clouds, matching the original atmospheric conditions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky condition has also been altered to a more dramatic setting with darker shades and some cloud formations that differ from the clear blue sky and wispy clouds observed in Image A.",
