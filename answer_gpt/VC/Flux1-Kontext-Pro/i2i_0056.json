      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of a horse whatsoever. The image is of a chibi character in a construction setting. There is no visual information indicating any horse or related attributes such as a brown coat or a dark mane. Therefore, any analysis of a horse cannot be applied to this image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain a horse. The image showcases a cartoon character in a construction outfit, standing upright. There is no reference to a horse or any grazing posture within this context.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background depicts a construction-themed setting with abstract block structures and a crane. There is no presence of a sea or a grassy shore. The analysis shows a complete change in context from a natural setting in Image A to a construction setting in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B comprises construction equipment and abstract block structures instead of any residential buildings like a white house. The change in setting from a natural landscape to a construction scenario explains this absence.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features no sea at all; instead, it focuses on construction elements. Therefore, with the absence of any body of water, the notion of the sea appearing calm does not apply.",
