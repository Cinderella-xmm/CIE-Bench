      "question": "Is the cluster of purple grapes visible in the basket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a decorative bottle rather than a basket held by a woman. The grapes appear as a charm hanging from a gold ring around the neck of the bottle, not as a cluster in a basket. This design deviation results in the absence of a basket, thus the question about the grapes being in the basket does not apply to the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the heart-shaped engraving present on the small terracotta jug?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no small terracotta jug visible; instead, the edited object is a decorative bottle with a heart-shaped charm that features grapes, but not an engraving on a terracotta jug. The design choices replace any jug with a vessel style, further making the question irrelevant in this context.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of a goose. The image is of a decorative bottle. Thus, the absence of a goose means any question regarding its colors or physical attributes is not applicable.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a decorative bottle, not a figure of a woman wearing a cloak. Therefore, there is no neckline or cloak present in this bottle design, rendering the question about a gold-colored clasp irrelevant.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no basket is visible; instead, the object is a decorative bottle. Thus, there are no fruits such as a red apple, green pear, or purple grapes in a basket as part of this image's design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no depiction of a woman or basket in Image B, as the focus is on a decorative bottle. Consequently, the position of a basket in relation to a woman does not apply in the context of the edited image.",
