    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the three figures positioned such that one is on the left, one in the center, and one on the right from the viewer's perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the three armored figures are clearly positioned one on the left, one in the center, and one on the right relative to the viewer. This arrangement is common in group imagery to balance the composition and is visually apparent from the image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the central figure standing fully upright with both feet on the rock and facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central armored figure is depicted standing upright, facing directly toward the viewer. He appears positioned assertively, a common posture for central figures in composed images to convey dominance or importance.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the ocean visible in the background behind the figures, with waves breaking against rocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a fantastical seascape with large, dramatic waves, but it doesn't specifically show waves breaking against rocks as in a realistic ocean scene. It is more of an artistically enhanced seascape setting.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the figures standing on dark, jagged rock formations in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The foreground in Image B shows waves rather than dark rock formations, as observed in the fantasy-themed edit. The figures are not standing directly on rocks but are set against this dynamic ocean wave environment.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sun positioned directly behind the central figure, creating a bright glow between his legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no sun depicted to create a glow between the central figure's legs. Instead, there are light effects that are more atmospheric, consistent with the fantasy theme rather than a naturalistic glow.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a clear horizon line separating the sky from the ocean in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a clear horizon line is not present; instead, the sky seamlessly transitions into the ocean setting without a defined separation, contributing to the overall surreal, fantastical approach of the image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the figure on the right have long, wavy hair extending past the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure on the right has hair that appears long and wavy, extending past the shoulders, which is a typical character styling in heroic or fantasy depictions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Does the figure on the left have curly, light brown hair reaching past the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure on the left has long hair that resembles a light brown color and extends past the shoulders, following the visual trope often seen in fantasy genre imagery.",
      "weight": 1,
