      "question": "Are the two garage doors positioned side by side on the lower front portion of the cabin, directly beneath the large upper window section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two garage doors are positioned side by side on the lower front portion of the cabin, directly beneath a large upper window section that spans most of the cabin's front width.

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a large, multi-pane window section with exposed wooden beams located directly above the two garage doors, spanning most of the front width of the cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a large window section directly above the two garage doors. The window area contains multiple panes and is flanked by exposed wooden beams, a typical architectural feature for allowing light into the upper level and providing an aesthetic, rustic character.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left side of the cabin near the front corner doesn't feature a small rectangular window cut into the log wall. Instead, there's a circular design and various decorative elements, which align with the edited, enchanted appearance of the cabin.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show a small rectangular window on the left side wall, nor is there a doorway immediately to the right since the left side design is altered to accommodate more organic and stylized features like glowing decorations and natural elements.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a transformed foundation base that doesn't appear to be purely concrete but rather blends into the natural surroundings with greenery and roots giving the appearance of integration with the forest floor, unlike typical concrete bases.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orientation of the cabin is such that the front façade appears to be angled slightly toward the right side of the image. This matches the natural perspective that the left side recedes into the background, enhancing the three-dimensional view of the cabin.",
