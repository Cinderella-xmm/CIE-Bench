      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a wooden box and a teapot drawing, and lacks any scene involving a shoji screen or diffused golden light. Therefore, the presence of warm, diffused light, if in Image A, is not represented in Image B.",
