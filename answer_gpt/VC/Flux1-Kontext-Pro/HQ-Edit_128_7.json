      "question": "Does the edited image preserve the multi-tiered, stepped gable structure of the church, with at least three distinct roof levels stacked vertically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the church with multiple roof levels stacked vertically, indicating a tiered, gable structure. This is apparent from the distinct layers of roofs above the central building, a feature commonly associated with traditional gable construction. Using world knowledge of architectural styles, such multi-tiered construction is indicative of complex, historical structures, often seen in certain cultural or religious architectures.",

      "question": "Are there visible carved wooden patterns along the eaves and gables of the church, even if overlaid with glowing runes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows intricate details along the eaves and gables, which can be recognized as carved wooden patterns. The addition of glowing runes in the edited image does not completely obscure these details. By analyzing the visual highlights and patterns, it can be inferred that such carvings are traditional elements often found in historical church architecture.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cross-shaped finial is visible at the very top of the central spire.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features decorative projections at the roof corners, consistent with antler-like shapes. These elements are distinctly observable and align with traditional decorations in medieval northern European architecture, which uses such forms for symbolic or aesthetic reasons.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features an arched doorway centrally located on the front facade, with steps leading up to it. This is a standard design element for entrances, particularly in religious architecture where grand entrances are framed by significant architectural features.",
