      "question": "Is the flowing brown and gray marbled pattern visible on the surfaces of the LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible surfaces of the objects show a distinct brown and gray marbled pattern. This pattern flows smoothly across the surfaces similar to natural marble. However, it is important to note that these objects do not resemble traditional LEGO bricks, which are typically geometric and have studs. Based on the visual cues and common knowledge, the objects resemble marbled spheres and cylinders rather than bricks, thus concluding that the pattern is visible on their surfaces.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the LEGO bricks rendered with a white base color accented by warm brown and gray marbling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The objects in Image B have a predominantly white color with accentuated brown and gray marbling, similar to classic marble designs but not shaped like traditional LEGO bricks. The visual elements suggest a white coloration as the base with marbled accents. Therefore, from the visual information and understanding of marbled designs, the objects bear a white base with accents in brown and gray.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the marbled veins follow an organic, irregular flow rather than a geometric or repetitive pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The veins visible in Image B flow organically and have irregular forms that mimic natural marble patterns, lacking any repetitive or geometric structuring that would be found in manufactured designs. The irregular and flowing nature is representative of the variety seen in genuine marble, hence based on visual cues, the veins follow an organic pattern.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both warm brown and gray veins present together in the marbled pattern of the LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surfaces of the objects in Image B show a combination of brown and gray in their marbling. Both colors interlace in the design, which indicates a presence of multiple hues commonly seen in diverse marble patterns. Since these elements are perceptible in Image B, and acknowledging prior observations, both colors are indeed present together.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the LEGO bricks visually appear to be made of a marble-like material based on their surface pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The objects in Image B exhibit a marbled surface typical of marble-like materials, with a pattern of veins and smooth, reflective surfaces. Such features visually mimic marble, giving the objects an authentic marble-like appearance, though they do not resemble traditional LEGO bricks. Thus, based on surface pattern recognition, the objects appear to be made of a marble-like material.",
