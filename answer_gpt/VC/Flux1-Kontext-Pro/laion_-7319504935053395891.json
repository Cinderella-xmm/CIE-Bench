    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the conical, tiered structure composed of multiple horizontal levels stacked vertically preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure appears conical and tiered, with layers stacked vertically. My world knowledge tells me that such a structure resembles a typical Christmas tree or decorative tower. Therefore, given the visual cues of the edited image, the conical and tiered aspect is maintained.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the teardrop-shaped chocolate droplets positioned at the center of each tier preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, there are oval or teardrop-shaped openings or decorations on the structure, but they do not specifically appear centered on each tier or as distinct droplets. Hence, my understanding is that these are altered or differently presented in the edited image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the chocolate pinecone-like structures supporting each tier preserved in their original form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible chocolate pinecone-like structures supporting tiers. The structure is different and the support mechanism, if any, is not apparent, meaning they are not preserved in their original form.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the nuts (including almonds, pecans, and hazelnuts) visibly contained within the teardrop-shaped droplets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, nuts are visible through the teardrop-shaped openings, akin to decorative elements, inside the structure. So, although the presentation differs slightly from complete transparency, they are visibly contained.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wide, circular base with a horizontal band at its edge preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a base which is circular with some form of decoration similar to branding. However, it is not as wide or as distinctly banded as in Image A. Therefore, this exact feature is not fully preserved.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the overall color scheme dominated by deep brown tones with gold highlights preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color scheme in Image B remains consistent with deep brown tones and gold highlights, commonly associated with chocolate products and decorative elements. Thus, the color scheme is preserved.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the teardrop-shaped droplets centrally aligned along the vertical axis of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the teardrop shapes do not appear to be consistently central along the vertical axis but are more part of the wider design. Therefore, they are not centrally aligned as a structural feature.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
