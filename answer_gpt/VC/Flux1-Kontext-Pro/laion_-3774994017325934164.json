      "question": "Is the subject’s hair light blonde in color and visibly full and styled upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character depicted appears to have hair that is visually similar to light blonde. The hair is voluminous and styled in a manner consistent with upward styling, which is commonly associated with a neat and groomed appearance. These visual cues confirm that the hair can be described as light blonde and styled upwardly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the subject have a prominent forehead and wide jawline that define the facial structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's facial structure is obscured, which prevents direct observation of specific facial features such as the forehead and jawline. Despite this, in typical animated figures, exaggerated features such as a prominent forehead and wide jawline might be stylistically present but cannot be concluded accurately in this image due to censorship.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the subject’s right hand raised with the palm facing outward and fingers spread in a waving motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's palms are visible with both hands raised and the fingers splayed outward. This posture is consistent with a gesture resembling a waving motion or inviting attention, thereby matching the description asked.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a necktie visible under the suit jacket, positioned at the front of the shirt collar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the attire consists of a shirt with a tie, distinctly visible at the front of the shirt collar. Such a configuration is classically part of formal attire and matches the description provided in the question.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the subject wearing a dark formal suit jacket over a white shirt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B is depicted in a colorful patterned suit, which stands out from the typical dark formal suit. Although the pattern may have dark elements, it does not fit the typical description of a 'dark formal suit jacket over a white shirt.' The shirt is also not identifiable as predominantly white.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the subject’s eyes directed forward, slightly toward the viewer’s left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orientation of the character's gaze could suggest a forward focus, but due to the artistic style and restriction in observing facial details, it's not apparent if the gaze has a directional preference such as 'toward the viewer's left.'",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the subject positioned centrally or slightly to the right of the frame, appearing to move forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B is centrally positioned in the frame, with an outward extension and spread palms indicating a stance that could be interpreted as inviting or engaging but not necessarily suggesting forward movement.",
