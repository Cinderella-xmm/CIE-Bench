    "Question": "Q1: Is the bird positioned in a side-facing profile, facing left?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is positioned in a side-facing profile. The visual cues indicate that the bird's head is turned to the left, and its beak is pointing in that direction. This is common for side-facing profiles where the viewer can see one side of the bird's body and the orientation suggests a leftward facing. Thus, based on these observations, the bird is indeed facing left.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the birdâ€™s feet visibly gripping the branch?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, upon close examination of the lower part of the bird, its feet can be seen positioned around the branch. The claws are apparent, suggesting that the bird is gripping the branch. This is consistent with the understanding of how birds perch on branches by curling their toes around the branch.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the main branch extend diagonally from the lower-left to the upper-right of the frame?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a branch that extends from the bottom left upwards to the right direction, but it does not span completely to the upper-right as the main branch is rather horizontal in its positioning. It also has a lot of vertical branches and ends more toward the middle-right of the frame.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there multiple clusters of blossoms distributed along the side branches of the main twig?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are clusters of blossoms distributed along the branches. These blossoms are noticeably arranged at various points along the visible side branches, suggesting multiple clusters rather than solitary blossoms.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are white snowflakes visible falling throughout the sky background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, an array of small white particles can be seen scattered throughout the sky, giving the appearance of snowflakes falling. This creates a snowy atmosphere within the image, reflecting the seasonal context of winter.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the background a uniform pale blue sky without clouds or gradients?",
    "explanation": "The background of Image B is not a pale blue sky but rather a darker shade, yet it is uniform without visible clouds or gradients. This sets a night-time or evening atmosphere rather than a pale blue, cloudless sky.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the bird located near the center of the image, with blossoms appearing on both the left and right sides of the branch?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is positioned toward the center of the composition. Blossoms are distinctly visible on branches extending both to the left and right sides of the main branch on which the bird is perched, confirming the presence of blossoms throughout the image on both sides.",
    "answer": "Yes"
