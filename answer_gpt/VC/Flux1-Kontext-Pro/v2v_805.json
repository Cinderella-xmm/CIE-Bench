      "question": "Is the text \"STORY PAGES\" present in uppercase serif font above the book?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'STORY PAGES' is prominently displayed within a snow globe, and it uses an uppercase serif font. This is determined by observing the clear letter spacing and serif elements indicative of the font style. Thus, the text appearing in this manner confirms the observation.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book is illustrated as part of a design within a snow globe. The book is depicted with a flat open appearance, showing two symmetrical pages without a visible spine, indicating an open structure from this perspective.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays an open book with several curved horizontal lines on pages on both sides, illustrating the effect of perspective on a stack of pages being opened. This artistic choice is common to represent book pages visually.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, within the snow globe, the book is placed directly beneath the 'STORY PAGES' text in a centralized position horizontally and vertically within the visible globe area. This alignment shows intentional graphic placement for symmetry.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book and text within the snow globe are rendered in a dark navy blue against a backdrop that appears more darkened and ambient due to lighting, thus not definitively on a light beige background. However, based on Image A, which would have also influenced Image B's artistic direction, the original intention may have been navy blue on beige.",
