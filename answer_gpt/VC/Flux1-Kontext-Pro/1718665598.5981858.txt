    "Question": "Q1: Is there a long, continuous road-like structure extending into the distance, serving as the central axis of the composition?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear depiction of a long, continuous road that stretches into the distance, serving as a central axis in the composition. This is inferred from the road's positioning and perspective, which guides the viewer's eye from the bottom foreground to the horizon in the background. Such a structure is typical in landscape scenes, providing depth and directing focus.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there visible diagonal streaks or patterns indicating falling rain across the scene?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents diagonal streaks across the whole scene, which are indicative of rain. These streaks are a common artistic method to simulate rainfall, showing movement and mimicking how rain typically falls at an angle due to wind.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there tall vertical structures with horizontal crossbars positioned along the right side of the road?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, tall vertical structures resembling utility poles are present along the right side of the road. These poles have horizontal crossbars and are spaced at regular intervals, supporting cables, which is common for electrical or communication poles.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there tree-like forms present on both sides of the road, aligned with the guardrails?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts tree-like forms on both sides of the road that are aligned with the guardrails. These forms are stylized representations of trees, demonstrated by their rounded tops and positions alongside the road where trees typically grow.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a visible division in the sky between dark clouds and a brighter, illuminated area near the horizon?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sky clearly shows a division where dark clouds cover most of the top area, while near the horizon there is a brighter, illuminated patch. This visual contrast is often used to depict dramatic weather changes or the aftermath of a storm.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there barrier-like structures running along both edges of the road?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, barriers resembling guardrails run along both edges of the road. They are identified by their horizontal alignment and positioning next to the road, suggesting a protective barrier separating the road from surrounding landscape areas.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is there a continuous yellow line running down the center of the road?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a continuous yellow line running down the center of the road. This line represents a typical road marking used to separate lanes or indicate direction in vehicular traffic, reinforcing the road's presence in the composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
