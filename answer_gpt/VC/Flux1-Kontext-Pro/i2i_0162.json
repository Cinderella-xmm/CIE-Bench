      "question": "Does the mouse retain its brown, orange, and white fur pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mouse displays a distinct coloration pattern, featuring shades of brown, orange, and white, which can be observed mainly on its back, around its eye area, and belly. By examining the fur colors visible in the image, the visual cues reinforce the identification of a multi-colored fur pattern that includes these specific hues, characteristic of such animals.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the mouse's whiskers and large ears clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mouse has prominent features, including large ears and distinct whiskers. These are critical anatomical features of a mouse that are clearly depicted due to their contrasting color against the surroundings and their relative size compared to the rest of the mouse's body. The illustration highlights these features, making them easily identifiable.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the food crumbs present on the floor near the mouse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows scattered food crumbs on the floor close to the mouse. These crumbs are discernible due to their placement and the texture contrast against the floor tiles. Common sense suggests that mice are often found near food items, potentially indicating a source of interest or distraction for the mouse.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the mouse positioned near the crumbs and looking downward towards them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mouse is seen positioned near the food crumbs, and its body orientation suggests that it is looking downward. The distribution of the crumbs and the mouse's pose, with lowered head and forward-facing direction, indicates that its attention is focused on these crumbs, likely due to the potential food interest.",

      "question": "Is the general kitchen setting with flooring and cabinets identifiable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has elements indicating a kitchen setting, including the tiled floor and cabinets that are visible in the background. By recognizing these typical kitchen elements, the image provides enough context to understand the environment as being a part of a residential kitchen space, common in mouse sightings inside homes.",
