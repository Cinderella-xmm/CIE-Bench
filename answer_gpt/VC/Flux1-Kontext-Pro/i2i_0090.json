      "question": "Is the stapler's primary color blue in both the front and rear views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which presents a split view (front and rear) of the stapler, both perspectives clearly show a blue object as the stapler. The main body and base of the stapler in both the front and rear views are consistently blue, reflecting the primary color of the stapler. This is identified through the consistent color seen in both views, which appears to be blue. By combining this observation with common sense about what 'primary color' means, it's clear the primary color in both views is blue.",

      "question": "Does the metallic hinge appear on the stapler in both the front and rear views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the front view of Image B, the metallic hinge holds the upper and lower parts of the stapler and is visible close to the base. However, in the rear view, the image does not display such metallic hinge elements; it seems to present a smooth surface with no metallic features like hinges visible. Based on this observation using the visual information, it can be concluded that the metallic hinge is not visible in the rear perspective of the stapler.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the front view of the stapler shows the part of the stapler where the papers are inserted for stapling. There is a visible metallic slot at the base that aligns with where staples are usually dispensed. Based on this identifiable feature and world knowledge of how staplers operate, it can be concluded that the stapling slot is visible in the front view.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both views show the stapler, but neither perspective shows an additional light blue strip distinct from the primary color across the top surface. The entire top surface in both views is just a single solid color of blue. Given this visual evidence, there is no light blue strip distinct from the rest of the stapler's blue color in either view.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a background with a consistent shade of green behind both the front and rear views of the stapler. The surface on which the stapler rests and the surrounding background all share a similar green color. Utilizing visual cues and the understanding of a uniform background suggests that the green color is consistent across both views.",
