      "question": "Does the character’s body retain the cylindrical shape and reddish-brown color of the original hot dogs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's body is positioned within a hot dog bun, with the body itself having a cylindrical shape and reddish-brown color, similar to the hot dogs in Image A. This indicates that the body does indeed retain the shape and color of the original hot dogs, allowing for a clear resemblance due to these similar characteristics.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the character’s hair incorporate the shredded texture of white, orange, and purple cabbage from the original coleslaw?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character’s hair in Image B features a solid texture that is bright green in color. This differs significantly from the shredded texture and colors (white, orange, and purple) seen in the coleslaw of Image A. Thus, the character’s hair does not incorporate the texture or colors from the original coleslaw.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the decorative plate has teal blue, burnt orange, and dark brown floral and scroll motifs, identical to those in Image A. This same design is clearly visible under the character in the edited image, confirming its presence in the base design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B is positioned on what appears to be a plate with the same decorative floral and scroll motifs as seen in Image A. This indicates that the base for the character is derived from the original plate design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B is presented with a single hot dog-like body within a bun, rather than two separate hot dogs as seen in Image A. There are no mirrored features or dual bodies that represent two hot dogs, thereby confirming that the representation is singular.",
