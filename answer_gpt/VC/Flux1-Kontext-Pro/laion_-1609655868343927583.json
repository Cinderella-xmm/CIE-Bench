    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the herringbone wood inlay pattern present on the surface of the transformed character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface elements of the transformed character, particularly on the drawer sections, exhibit decorative details that do not strongly present a herringbone wood inlay pattern. Instead, they are adorned with ornate designs typical of armor or costume that offer a cohesive look across the transformed character's body. The herringbone pattern is a distinct, V-shaped weaving pattern that would be more evidently visible if present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the circular brass ring pulls and adjacent escutcheons present on the transformed character’s waist area, matching their original positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the transformed character with decorative elements on the chest area where drawers are represented, but these elements appear to be lavishly detailed and embedded with jewels rather than the simple circular brass ring pulls and escutcheons found on the original cabinet. The positioning and appearance have been significantly altered in this transformation.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the transformed character retain the original warm amber-brown wood color as the base tone of its body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observation of Image B, the base tone of the body, especially noticeable in the chest drawer area, maintains a warm amber-brown color, similar to the original cabinet's wood tone in Image A. The likeness is achieved through the consistent color which is visible despite the additional ornate designs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the transformed character’s feet retain small brass caps at their ends, corresponding to the original leg caps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feet of the transformed character do not exhibit small brass caps like those on the cabinet's legs. Instead, the feet form part of the armored boot design, which does not seem to have the brass caps that finished the original cabinet legs in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the legs of the transformed character still tapered, narrowing from top to bottom, consistent with the original cabinet legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of Image B reveals that the legs of the transformed character do not retain a tapered design but are instead designed to fit into a robust armored form. The original cabinet in Image A had legs that visibly tapered, but this aspect is not maintained in the edited image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the two drawers/pouches positioned vertically one above the other on the transformed character, maintaining their original stacking order?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed character features multiple drawer-like pouches arranged vertically on the front, retaining the one-above-the-other stacking orientation as seen in the original cabinet in Image A. This maintains the drawer order as expected from the cabinet transformation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the brass foliate motif visible on the side of the transformed character’s torso, in the same location as the original cabinet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformed character in Image B does not distinctly show the brass foliate motif on its sides that was thoughtfully placed on the original cabinet in Image A. The character’s armor design seems to focus on other ornate details and does not mirror the specific motif placement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Does the crown portion of the transformed character retain the original semi-circular edge shape of the marble top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the headpiece of the transformed character is designed as a crown, which logically diverges from the semi-circular edge shape of the marble top in Image A. The crown has a rounded and detailed design that contrasts with the original cabinet top's simple semi-circular curve.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Do the transformed pouches retain a dark interior, suggesting depth and openness, consistent with the original drawer interiors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The drawer sections of the transformed character in Image B show darkness within, consistent with the appearance of depth and openness seen in the original cabinet drawers of Image A. This visual detail suggests utility similar to the original furniture.",
