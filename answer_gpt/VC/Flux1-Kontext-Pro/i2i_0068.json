        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the analysis of the seated person shows that the cake is being held with one hand resting on their knee and the other hand underneath the cake. This indicates that the seated person is holding the cake with both hands. Given the visual information and common sense understanding of holding an object for stability, it is reasonable to conclude that the cake is held with both hands.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the candles on the cake appear to have small lights on top, indicating they are still lit.
