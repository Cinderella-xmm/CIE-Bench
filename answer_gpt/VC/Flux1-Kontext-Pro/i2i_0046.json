    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the skater captured mid-air while performing the trick?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater is visibly above the ground and there is space between his feet and the surface, indicating he's airborne. This visual detail, combined with knowledge of skateboarding tricks, supports the conclusion that the skater is captured mid-air during his performance.",

    {

      "question": "Does the skater's hat still feature the geometric pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the skater wearing a hat with distinct geometric patterns, similar to traditional designs seen globally on knitwear. These patterns are consistent across the hat, confirming its continuous presence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the skateboard positioned below the skater in mid-flip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard is located beneath the skater in a diagonal orientation, suggesting it is mid-flip. This reflects a common setting in skateboarding where the board rotates under the skater during tricks.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays large structures and branches in the background, providing context regarding the setting against clear sky. These details create a recognizable urban environment typical in such outdoor skateboarding settings.",

    },
    {

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top section of Image B shows a vivid blue sky, unblemished by clouds, typical of a sunny day. This visual cue implies favorable weather conditions above the setting.",
