      "question": "Is the large circular rose window located above the central portal and featuring intricate radial tracery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, there is a large circular rose window prominently located above the central portal. This window features elaborate radial tracery, a common characteristic of Gothic architecture. The design suggests complexity and precision, often seen in such structures. Although the window is part of a model or diorama, this does not detract from its design elements. Based on these observations, the rose window matches the description given in the question.",

      "question": "Are there three distinct arched entrances at the base of the façade, arranged symmetrically with the central one being the largest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the façade of the cathedral model includes three distinct arched entrances at the base. The central entrance is larger than the two side entrances, which are symmetrical in design. This arrangement is typical of Gothic cathedrals, emphasizing the grandeur of the central portal. The diorama's scale and detail maintain this traditional symmetrical layout, illustrating Gothic architecture's balance and design principles.",

      "question": "Are there two tall, slender spires positioned symmetrically at the outer edges of the central gable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the model features two slender spires, which are tall and positioned at the outer edges of the central section. These spires contribute to the symmetry of the façade, flanking the central gable. This characteristic design element is consistent with Gothic architectural styles, where spires enhance verticality. Their positioning symmetrically framing the central gable further reinforces the question's description.",

      "question": "Is the façade symmetrically balanced around a central vertical axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cathedral model's façade is structured symmetrically around a central vertical axis. This symmetry is evident in the layout of the spires, rose window, portals, and other architectural elements that are mirrored on either side of the central axis. Such symmetry is a hallmark of Gothic cathedral design, showcasing balance and harmony.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the cathedral model includes detailed and intricate carvings visible across its façade. These include tracery around the rose window, pinnacles, and additional sculptural details characteristic of Gothic architecture. Although these elements are part of a miniature model, their visibility and complexity reflect typical Gothic decorative techniques.",

      "question": "Are there flying buttresses extending from the sides of the nave toward the exterior walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on the frontal view of the cathedral model, housed in a case. From this angle, while the façade and its details are prominent, elements like flying buttresses, which typically extend from the sides toward exterior walls, are not visible or determinable in the model's enclosed depiction. Given the limitations of the perspective, no evidence of flying buttresses can be conclusively identified.",

      "question": "Is there a triangular gable directly above the central rose window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cathedral model displays a triangular gable positioned directly above the central rose window. This triangular section is an integral part of the architectural design, sitting prominently above the window, consistent with Gothic architectural elements intended to guide the viewer's eye upward. The gable's placement accentuates the focal point created by the rose window.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observation of Image B reveals that there are several slender pinnacles extending from the model's roofline, both in the central sections and flanking parts of the structure. These pinnacles are an essential component of Gothic architecture, providing vertical emphasis and enhancing the intricate silhouettes typical of such cathedrals. The model accurately replicates these elements, consistent with descriptions of Gothic pinnacles.",
