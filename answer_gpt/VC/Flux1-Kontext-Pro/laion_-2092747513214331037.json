      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cyclist is depicted in an aerodynamic, forward-leaning position which is common in time trial cycling to reduce wind resistance, with their hands positioned on aerobars. This is a typical stance for cyclists aiming to maximize speed.",
