      "question": "Does the girl retain her original throwing posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl's posture with her hand, which is raised and seems to be in alignment with an act of throwing or catching something, matches the posture observed in the original Image A where she appears to be mimicking a throwing motion. Based on this analysis, the girl's posture reflects a continuity of action as if she's in the act of throwing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red dress and polka-dot pattern retained intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl's outfit remains a red dress with white polka-dots, identical to what is seen in Image A. This suggests that the characteristic red dress and polka-dot pattern were preserved through the image transformation process.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the girl still positioned in the foreground relative to the ground or new sci-fi background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the girl standing prominently in the foreground against a new sci-fi background, similar to her prominent positioning on a stone in the original Image A (with a normal neighborhood setting). This consistency in positioning indicates that she remains in the foreground.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the girl's feet still placed on the stone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B still depicts the girl standing on a stone or stone-like platform, which creates a direct parallel to the original Image A where she was also standing on a similar object. The decision to maintain this detail suggests her position on the stone is unchanged.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the girl's hands still extended outward as if throwing something?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl's hands are indeed extended outward, mimicking an act of throwing or having thrown something, which matches the action portrayed in Image A where her hands are similarly extended. This posture indicates that her hands are kept in a similar position as in the original image.",
