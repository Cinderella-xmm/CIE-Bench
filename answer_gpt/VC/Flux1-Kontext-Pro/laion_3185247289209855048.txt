{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the lipstick applied in a rich red shade?",

}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the subject looking upward and toward the upper left of the frame?",
    "explanation": "The orientation of the eyes and facial direction is obscured by the blur in Image B, making it impossible to analyze the gaze direction. The answer is therefore 'No'.",

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there soft highlights on the cheekbones and jawline created by directional lighting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, due to the blurring effect, any highlights on the cheekbones and jawline cannot be discerned, so it's not possible to confirm the presence of such highlights. The logical answer, given the lack of visible detail, is 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the facial features symmetrically aligned with balanced spacing between the eyes, nose, and mouth?",
