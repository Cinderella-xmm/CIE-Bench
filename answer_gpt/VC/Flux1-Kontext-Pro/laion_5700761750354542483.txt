    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the butterfly’s four-winged structure with two large upper wings and two smaller lower wings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly clearly has four wings: two large upper wings and two smaller lower wings. This structure is typical for butterflies, as their anatomy commonly includes a set of larger forewings and smaller hindwings. The visual cues in the image show a clearly separated wing structure, consistent with the typical appearance of butterflies.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the butterfly depicted with symmetrical wings on both sides?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wings on both sides of the butterfly appear symmetrical in terms of shape, size, and decoration. The design and embellishments on the left wings mirror those on the right, which is typically done to maintain a visually balanced and aesthetically pleasing representation of a butterfly.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a visible central body connecting the wings?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, a central body segment is visible between the wings, serving as the connector for the four wings. The body is decorated with a series of embellishments, and it stands out in contrast to the wings, which is consistent with how butterfly bodies usually appear.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a loop or attachment point at the top of the butterfly’s head?",
    "explanation": "Examining Image B reveals that there are antennae, but there is no visible loop or dedicated attachment point at the top of the butterfly’s head, suggesting the design is more focused on decorative aspects rather than functional ones like attachment.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the butterfly positioned with wings fully spread in a flat, horizontal orientation?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the wings of the butterfly appear to be fully spread out in a horizontal plane, with the upper and lower wings extended to showcase the decorative patterns. This orientation aligns with how butterflies are typically displayed in decorative contexts, emphasizing symmetry and design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the wings proportionally larger than the body, matching the original scale?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wings are notably larger in proportion to the size of the body, characteristic of butterfly anatomy where the wings offer a significant surface area. This scale is commonly observed in artistic or decorative butterfly depictions to highlight the intricate designs on the wings.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do the upper wings have a pointed tip and curved outer edge?",
    "explanation": "The upper wings in the edited image feature a design where the tips are pointed, and the outer edges have a slight curve, which is characteristic of many butterfly species. This shape helps create an elegant and dynamic appearance typical in butterfly representations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Are the lower wings visibly smaller and more rounded than the upper wings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lower wings are indeed depicted as smaller and more rounded compared to the upper wings. This differentiation in wing size and shape is typical of butterflies, where the upper wings often dominate for visual balance and symmetry.",
    "answer": "Yes"
