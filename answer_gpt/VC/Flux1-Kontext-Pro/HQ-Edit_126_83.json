      "question": "Is the upper garment (jeogori) olive green in color with a smooth, satin-like texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual analysis of Image B, the upper garment, known as a jeogori, appears in an olive green color. The fabric reflects light in a way that suggests a smooth, satin-like texture, commonly seen in traditional Korean attire. The glossiness is evident from the shine visible on the garment's surface. Therefore, the reasoning leads to the conclusion that the garment is indeed olive green and has a satin-like texture.",
