      "question": "Is the word \"SCARECROW\" clearly visible and legible on the label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the label prominently features the words 'THE CURIOUS SCARECROW WINE ADVENTURE'. This phrase is clearly visible and legible, but the word 'SCARECROW' from Image A is not present. Thus, although 'SCARECROW' is part of the new label phrase, the word is not standalone and replicated exactly as it appeared in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the year \"2017\" visible somewhere on the bottle or label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the label does not include any specific year like '2017'. The label features a different text arrangement that focuses on the playful characterization of the concept, without mentioning a year.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the icon at the top of the label, now transformed into a face, retain the shape of a straw hat and rustic features consistent with a scarecrow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The label in Image B has incorporated a face on it as part of the design. This face does not maintain the simpler straw hat form seen in Image A's logo. The rustic features, reminiscent of a scarecrow's traditional representation, aren't clearly maintained as the new design projects a more animated character face.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the label still a rectangular shape positioned centrally on the front of the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the label features a visual design depicting a face with vines wrapping around the bottle, which departs from the rectangular, central placement and design seen in Image A. The label’s placement and design contribute to a theme rather than strict geometry.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle is clearly oriented vertically, standing upright in the setting, with its silhouette and overall posture maintaining the standard upright orientation of a wine bottle.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The label in Image B is positioned in a manner consistent with most wine bottle labels, aligned centrally from a visual perspective when considering the face occupies the upper portion of the label and vines cover other parts of the bottle that provide thematic context.",
