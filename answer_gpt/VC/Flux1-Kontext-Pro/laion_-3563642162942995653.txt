    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain exactly six wheels arranged in three axles, with the front axle near the cab and two rear axles supporting the cargo body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the model of the vehicle, although made out of glass, retains the same structural layout as a typical truck. By examining the design, we see three axles, with the front axle near the cab and two rear axles supporting the cargo body. This arrangement suggests the vehicle maintains the same six-wheel configuration.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the cargo body positioned directly behind the cab, maintaining the same horizontal alignment and proportional length as in the original image?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing the glass model in Image B, the cargo body is directly behind the cab, preserving the alignment and proportional length as typically seen in vehicles of this kind. The overall design point mirrors that of a conventional truck structure, suggesting that the horizontal placement and length are unchanged from Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there two rectangular windows visible on the side of the cargo body, located approximately one-third and two-thirds along its length?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass vehicle shows two distinct rectangular shapes on the side of the cargo body. These are likely to be windows, aligned at approximately one-third and two-thirds of the cargo body length, mirroring the configuration seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Is the vertical slatted grille present on the front of the vehicle, centered between the headlights and aligned with the hood?",
    "explanation": "Observing the front of the glass model in Image B, the area between the headlights features a clearly defined vertical slatted grille, centrally positioned and aligning with the hood, consistent with typical vehicle designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a side mirror attached to the driver’s side door, extending outward from the upper portion of the door?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a small protrusion is visible near the upper part of the driver’s side door. This shape resembles that of a side mirror, extending outward from the door, which is typical for vehicle designs to provide rear visibility.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a horizontal ladder affixed to the lower side of the cargo body, running parallel to the ground?",
    "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, there is no visible indication of a ladder or ladder-like structure affixed horizontally to the lower side of the cargo body. The glass design does not include this element, which is not a common feature in such vehicle models.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is there a silver-colored door handle visible on the driver’s side door, positioned midway down the door?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass model does not exhibit any distinctive silver or contrastingly colored features representing a door handle on the driver's side door. The homogeneous glass appearance potentially obscures this detail if it was present.",
    "answer": "No"
