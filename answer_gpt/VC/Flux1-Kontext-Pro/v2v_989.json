      "question": "Is the dog depicted with a black coat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show that the dog is illustrated with a solid dark color, representing a black coat. In cartoon or simplified graphic styles, darker areas are often used to illustrate black, and the lack of variation implies a singular coat color.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog appears to be in a curled up posture with its head resting on the ground. Such a visual depiction indicates a relaxed, lying-down posture, consistent with how animals rest when they are at ease.",

      "question": "Is the bench depicted in green?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the bench in a color that appears to be similar to a muted or dark green against the background. In simplified graphics, such colors often depict objects intended to be green, especially if the context involves natural or outdoor settings, commonly associated with green benches.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is drawn directly adjacent to the base of the bench, just in front of or beneath the bench's sitting area. This position is considered to be 'next to' the bench both visually and contextually given typical descriptions of spatial arrangements.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays three distinct items on the bench: a radio, a carton designed to look like a juice box, and a round-topped figure resembling a trash bag. These items are positioned on top of the bench's sitting area, confirming the presence of all three items.",
