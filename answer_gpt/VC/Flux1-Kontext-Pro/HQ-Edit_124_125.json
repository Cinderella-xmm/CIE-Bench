      "question": "Is the subject’s left leg raised and held behind her back with both hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's left leg is raised as part of a yoga pose and held by her left hand over her head. Her right hand is extended upward but not holding the leg. Analyzing the pose, it represents flexibility as the subject performs a stretch where one hand supports the raised leg. This analysis is based solely on observing the pose in Image B without referring to Image A.",

      "question": "Is the sun located directly behind the subject’s torso, forming a halo-like glow around her silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sun is positioned behind the subject's torso, creating a bright circular halo effect that highlights her silhouette against the sunset. This visual composition emphasizes the yoga pose, and the sun's position suggests she's performing the activity at the golden hour, which is common for photography themes.",

      "question": "Is the beach surface visibly wet, showing reflections of the sun and ocean waves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the beach surface appears wet, as there is a distinct reflection of sunlight and the ocean waves. The shiny texture and reflective quality of the sand suggest recent contact with water, which is typical when observing wet sand near water bodies. This impression comes from the reflections and light patterns on the sand observed solely in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, two rocky formations are visible: one is positioned on the left and the other on the right side of the background. They add to the coastal scenery, providing contrast and depth in the composition. This conclusion is drawn from the visual cues of two distinct darker shapes against the ocean waves in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is depicted standing with her right foot flat on the sand without any footwear, indicating she is barefoot. The posture and contact of the foot with the ground suggest stability, which is essential for this yoga pose. This evaluation is made by closely observing the details of her feet and legs in the edited image.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Evaluating Image B, the subject’s hairstyle is a neat bun situated at the back of her head. A bun hairstyle is common for activities requiring minimal distraction such as yoga. The bun is visible against the light background, indicating its placement as described.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the subject’s head is slightly tilted upward, with her face directed towards the sky, indicating focus and alignment typical in yoga practice. This pose opens up the throat and neck area, which can signify an extension posture, visible from her upward gaze.",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the ocean waves are depicted breaking along the shoreline, contributing to a realistic coastal setting. These waves are visible directly behind the subject, creating a dynamic background consistent with a beach environment. This observation is made through the visual cues provided in Image B.",
