      "question": "Is the McLaren logo clearly visible on the center of the car's hood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which shows a miniature car model within a glass case, the front portion of the car is visible. Upon close inspection, the McLaren logo is not clearly visible or identifiable on the center of the car's hood. This might be due to the scale of the model or the limitations of the detailing on such a small representation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the headlights shaped in a narrow, curved, and horizontally elongated design with internal LED strips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car model displays headlights that have a narrow, curved, horizontally elongated shape. However, the internal LED strips are not distinctly visible due to the scale and the level of detail possible in the miniature display case. It is unclear if intricate details such as LED strips are present or discernible in the model.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the brake calipers behind the front wheels colored bright orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, where the car model is showcased, the front wheels' brake area is partially visible. The color and detail of the brake calipers are not clearly discernible, especially the specific coloring that should appear bright orange. Due to the small scale and distance, this detail may not be accurately depicted in the model.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the tree leaves display a vibrant, natural green color without significant discoloration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, within the display case, the background image includes trees that appear as part of the printed backdrop. The tree leaves look green, but they have a subdued, less vibrant tone, possibly due to them being part of a background image rather than being differentiated as separate 3D elements.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are white lane markings present on the asphalt road beneath the car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a road beneath the car model where white lane markings are visible. These markings are part of the background image encased within the glass box display, making them an intended feature of the diorama.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the car have a raised, sharply angled edge along the side above the wheel arches indicating dihedral door hinges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a noticeable contour and styling detail above the wheel arches of the car model, which is indicative of the design element often associated with performance cars. However, this may not definitively indicate that the feature is for dihedral door hinges, which are typically a mechanical specification not distinctly visible from a static model.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there at least two other cars visible in the background â€” one red and one yellow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backdrop shows a street scene behind the model car. There is a yellow car visible in the background, but there is no red car discernible in the given view. The placement and angle might cause some elements to be obscured, leading to the lack of visibility of a red car.",
