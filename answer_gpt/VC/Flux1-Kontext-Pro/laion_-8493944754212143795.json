    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there visible sunlight reflecting off the water surface, creating bright sparkles and highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a luminous dragon emerging from the water, featuring bright blue highlights on its scales, but the water does not exhibit typical sunlight reflections or sparkles visible on a water surface. This is an artistic depiction with no direct sunlight reflections, known from the dragon's luminous nature rather than natural light effects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible patches of green moss or algae on the rock surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a fantastical scene where a dragon is emerging from water, it doesn't include realistic elements like green moss or algae on rock surfaces. The settings in Image B focus on the dragon and its luminous wings rather than the natural detailed rock surfaces.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there white, foamy water at the base of the cascade and along the edges of the flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a dragon emerging from water with visible white foamy water around its base, mimicking the turbulence caused as the dragon rises. This fantastical depiction includes such water phenomena to enhance the scene's dynamic realism.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the rocks exhibit a layered, stepped formation with visible cracks and erosion lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not showcase any rocks, rather a dragon dominates the scene. The focus is on the dragon itself and the surrounding waters, so layered rocks, cracks, or erosion lines are absent in this artistic rendering.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the water flow downward from the upper part of the image toward the lower part?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B primarily captures a dragon rising from water, creating a movement effect with splashes but there is no depicted waterfall or water flowing downward from the upper section. The water's movement surrounding the dragon is horizontal and splash-oriented.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a clear contrast between the dark, wet rock surfaces and the bright, fast-moving water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B centers around a dragon emerging from the sea with dynamic water movement surrounding it. It lacks dark, wet rock surfaces thus not presenting a contrast commonly associated with bright, fast-moving water against such rocks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there visible water droplets or mist suspended in the air above the falling water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a dragon generating motion as it rises from the water, causing droplets and mist due to turbulent movement. This fantasy depiction includes water effects to amplify the sceneâ€™s dramatic action around the dragon.",
