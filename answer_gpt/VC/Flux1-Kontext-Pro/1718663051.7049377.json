    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there exactly one tree positioned in the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central focus of the composition is a singular tree which is prominently and symmetrically placed in the center of the image. The tree stands as the focal point against the background, providing balance and harmony to the overall composition.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the tree have a clearly defined layered canopy structure with multiple horizontal tiers of foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tree in Image B indeed demonstrates a defined layered structure, characterized by horizontal tiers of foliage. This structure is visually apparent from the way the branches are arranged at alternating levels, which create distinct and recognizable layers from top to bottom.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the tree positioned in front of the mountain range in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree is visibly set in front of a series of mountains in the background. The tree's silhouette is clearly outlined against the backdrop of the mountains, which are delineated behind the tree, showcasing a clear depth of field.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible shadow extending from the base of the tree onto the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no discernible shadow extending from the base of the tree. The design appears more stylized, akin to a stained-glass window, and focuses on mythical visual elements rather than realistic light and shadow play.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a flat grassy plain beneath the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground beneath the tree appears to be a flat and expansive grassy plain. This is evidenced by the horizontal lines of the composition and the even, uninterrupted ground that supports the tree.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there mountains visible in the background behind the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are indeed mountains in the background of Image B. These mountains are depicted with stylized, triangular peaks that sit behind the centrally positioned tree, adding depth and context to the landscape.",
