    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image preserve the concentric spiral structure of the staircase, with steps forming progressively smaller rings as they descend toward the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the staircase maintains its concentric spiral structure, evident from the sequentially diminishing size of the rings as they approach the center. This is indicated by the steps consistently aligning in circular patterns, characteristic of a descending spiral staircase. The visual cue of repetitive concentric circles analyze that the architectural structure is preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the parallel rectangular shadows cast across the steps by sunlight still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parallel rectangular shadows are visible and fall upon the steps, cast by sunlight penetrating through a likely window or slat structure. The shadows align diagonally across the steps, denoting the presence of a consistent light source. The persistence of this pattern suggests the shadows remain unchanged from their prior orientation.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a dark circular void at the center of the spiral, representing the bottom of the staircase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a discernible dark circular void is positioned at the center, likely to represent the profound bottom of the spiral staircase. This aspect forms a focal center typical in the design of spiral staircases, where the absence of steps converges into a dark hollow, signifying the lowest point.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the handrail remain aligned along the outer edge of the spiral, following the same curvature as the steps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handrail consistently follows the curvature of the steps along the spiral's outer edge. The alignment is discernible through the rail's morphological continuity, which maintains parallelism with the edge of the staircase itself, ensuring user safety and mirroring the architectural curvature.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the stone steps still visible with their original texture, including faint veining and minor surface imperfections, even if reinterpreted as scales?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone steps exhibit textural attributes such as faint veining and minor blemishes, typical of natural stone surfaces. The visibility of these features, even if they might be slightly altered or enhanced, suggests that the original texture, including surface imperfections, is preserved and noticeable.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the shadows fall in the same diagonal direction across the steps as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows consistently project in a diagonal direction across the steps. The shadow's path continues uniformly at the same angle, highlighting that the light source's position or angle has not been altered between the two images.",
