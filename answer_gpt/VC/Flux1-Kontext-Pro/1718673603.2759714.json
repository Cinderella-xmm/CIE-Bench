      "question": "Is the two-tiered roof with upward-curving eaves and ornamental ridge details preserved in the same structural outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two-tiered roof design with upward-curving eaves is clearly visible, indicating the structure is maintained. The ornamental ridge details are simplified to fit the artistic style, but the general outline is preserved. When comparing with Image A, the roofs have the same structural outline, showing the key architectural elements are kept intact.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the large red moon positioned in the upper center of the sky and retaining its dominant red color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the large red moon is prominently placed in the upper center area of the sky, maintaining its distinct red hue as a focal point. Comparing with Image A, the moon in B retains the same central positioning and color, signifying a clear preservation of these elements.",
      "weight": 3,

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there two red-colored trees symmetrically placed on the left and right sides of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees are depicted in vibrant red color, positioned symmetrically on both sides of the building in the composition, contributing to a balanced aesthetic. This mirrors the arrangement in Image A, confirming the placement and color symmetry has been preserved in the edit.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a reflective body of water in the foreground mirroring the building and moon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a stylized water reflection, showcasing a reflection of the building but the moon's reflection is not explicitly depicted, possibly due to artistic choice. In comparison, Image A distinctly shows a complete reflection in the water foreground, illustrating a difference in the presentation of reflections in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there stone steps descending from the building platform toward the pond?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, stone steps are illustrated, leading from the building towards where the pond would be. The artistic style simplifies these details but retains the structure. Compared to Image A, where the steps are more detailed, Image B still maintains this essential architectural feature.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the windows on the building emitting a warm orange light, particularly on the upper and lower levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the windows are colored to emit a glow suggestive of a warm orange light, consistent across both levels of the structure. Image A showcases a more realistic warm light, but the stylized interpretation in B holds true to this element.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, green areas are depicted around the building and near the pond-like area, though they are rendered in a simplified artistic style. Image A illustrates detailed shrubs and plants, whereas the edited image keeps the general idea of greenery, albeit less explicitly detailed.",
