      "question": "Is there visible steam rising from the broccoli/tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on a broccoli structure that has roots in a forest setting. The image features a natural environment, suggesting the broccoli/tree is growing naturally rather than being served hot and freshly cooked on a plate. By looking at the broccoli/tree in Image B, there is no indication of steam rising from the broccoli, which aligns with the typical visual absence of steam in outdoor settings. Steam is usually indicative of heat, especially in contexts involving food preparation, which does not apply here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the broccoli/tree rest on a white plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a broccoli resembling a tree growing in a forest, rooted into the soil. The ground is depicted with leaves and greenery, reinforcing the idea that this is an outdoor scene. There is no white plate present in this natural, forest environment, in contrast to what one might expect in a dining setup.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the broccoli/tree primarily green in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a broccoli/tree structure that is predominantly green. The florets are a darker shade of green while the stem-like base has a lighter green hue. Combining visual cues from the image and knowledge of broccoli, which is typically green, leads to the conclusion that the primary color of the broccoli/tree in Image B is green.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the characteristic florets of the broccoli discernible on the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The broccoli/tree shown in Image B clearly displays the florets distinctive to broccoli, with its dense cluster pattern. These small rounded structures are characteristic of broccoli, distinguishing it from other types of trees. They are easily identifiable despite the setting being in a forest. This understanding comes from the visual similarity to broccoli in terms of structure and texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the broccoli/tree have a defined stem-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a broccoli-like structure with a prominent base or stem that mimics the trunk of a tree. This stem-like part connects the dense florets at the top to the roots embedded in the forest soil, highlighting a stem-like characteristic. Knowledge of broccoli, which typically has a thick stalk or stem leading to the florets, supports this observation.",
