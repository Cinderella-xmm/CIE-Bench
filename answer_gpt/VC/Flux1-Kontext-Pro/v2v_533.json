      "question": "Does the guitar retain its teal color and circular sound hole?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar exhibits a teal color and has a circular sound hole, as observed from its body and shape. This is consistent with typical acoustic guitar designs, identifying the sound hole in the center and the unique teal shade of its body. The comparison with Image A shows that the guitar maintains both these characteristicsâ€”its color and the shape of the sound hole. There is no difference in these specific aspects between the two images.",

      "question": "Are there still six tuning pegs on the guitar's headstock?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "The headstock of the guitar in Image B shows six tuning pegs, which align with the standard configuration for most acoustic guitars. These pegs are crucial for adjusting the tension of the strings, thus enabling tuning. In comparison to Image A, which also displays six tuning pegs, there is no change in this feature, ensuring the guitar's tuning capabilities remain intact.",

      "question": "Is the microphone still positioned near the guitar?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the microphone is prominently placed on a stand close to the guitar, suggesting an arrangement familiar in performance settings where a musician may sing and play the guitar simultaneously. Comparing this with Image A, the positioning of the microphone relative to the guitar remains unchanged, indicating a consistent setup across both images.",

      "question": "Is the amplifier still placed behind the guitar?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows an amplifier situated behind the guitar, which is a typical setup for amplifying the sound of an electric or electro-acoustic instrument. The comparison with Image A, which also exhibits this configuration, confirms that the position of the amplifier relative to the guitar stays the same.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar is seen leaning against the amplifier, a common way to rest an instrument when not in use. Analyzing Image A reveals the same posture and setup. The consistency in the guitar's leaning posture suggests no change between the original and edited images, preserving this aspect of the guitar-amp interaction as an unchanged feature.",
