      "question": "Are there exactly four rotor assemblies arranged symmetrically around the central body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drone clearly has four rotor assemblies, with each rotor consisting of propeller blades and guard rails, positioned at the corners of the drone's central body. These assemblies are placed at equal distances from each other, creating a symmetrical arrangement. This is typical of standard quadcopter designs, where the symmetry helps in maintaining balance during flight. Thus, based on the visual structure and common design knowledge, the drone does indeed have four rotor assemblies arranged symmetrically.",

      "question": "Are there yellow triangular markings present on the top and side surfaces of the central body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the presence of yellow triangular markings on both the top and side surfaces of the central body of the drone. These markings appear to be part of the design and are clearly visible against the black surface of the drone. The positioning and shape suggest they are intended for aesthetic or branding purposes, as is common with many consumer drones for easy identification of direction or brand.",

      "question": "Are the landing supports shaped like V-forms at each corner of the drone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the landing supports extend downward from the corners of the drone's central body and have a distinct V-shape. This V-form is typically used to provide stability when the drone is on the ground, ensuring that it can land evenly on flat surfaces. The clarity of the image shows these supports in their characteristic shape and position, verifying their design as V-forms.",

      "question": "Does the central body feature sharp, angular edges and a polygonal structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central body of the drone in Image B is depicted with well-defined, sharp edges and a clear polygonal structure. It features multiple angular surfaces that converge to form this design, typical of modern drone aesthetics which prioritizes aerodynamic efficiency and a futuristic look. The visual cues suggest that the design is deliberate and precise.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there three small rectangular lights aligned horizontally on the top surface of the central body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible small rectangular lights aligned horizontally on the top surface of the central body. Instead, the design seems to incorporate other aesthetic elements, and any marking or detail does not appear to function as a light fixture. The top is marked with different symbols or graphics rather than distinct light features.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the drone predominantly black with yellow accent markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The drone in Image B is primarily colored black, with yellow markings serving as accents. These yellow accents are prominently displayed on its central body and rotor arms, providing contrast against the black base and contributing to the overall design aesthetic. This color scheme is common for visibility and style in technological gadgets.",
