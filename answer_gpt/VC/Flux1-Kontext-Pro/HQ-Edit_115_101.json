      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the decorative patterns cover the surface with noticeable embossed relief. The visible depth and the way light casts shadows on different areas suggest raised surfaces or relief work. This technique adds texture and dimensionality often seen in intricate metalwork or crafts, enhancing the visual sophistication and tactile qualities.",
