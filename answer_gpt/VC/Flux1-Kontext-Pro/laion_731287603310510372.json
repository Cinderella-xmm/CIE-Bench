    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the gray flat cap still present on the man's head, maintaining its original shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is still wearing a gray flat cap. Its shape and position appear consistent with how such caps are typically worn. The structure of the cap does not show any alterations from its typical style, suggesting it maintains its original shape and position.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the small brown leather tag visible on the side of the cap near the back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon examining the side of the cap, there is no visible evidence of a small brown leather tag. This indicates that it is not present or not visible due to the styling or lighting in the image.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the man wearing a darker jacket, which is different from a heather gray crew-neck t-shirt. Therefore, the appearance does not match the specified clothing.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the man have a mustache and a goatee?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lower part of the man's face in Image B is obscured by the blurring, but there is no indication of facial hair such as a mustache or goatee visible through or around the blur when examining other parts not covered.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the man is positioned in what appears to be a side profile but with a slight angle, facing more towards the viewer's left. This side orientation suggests that, overall, he is facing to the left.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the textures of the cap and shirt consistent with a heather gray fabric (i.e., showing a mix of light and dark fibers)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cap visually presents a texture consistent with a heather gray fabric, showing variation in tones that are typical of mixed fibers. However, the shirt cannot be assessed for fabric texture as it is covered by a jacket.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the cap sitting naturally on the man's head, aligned with the contours of his skull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cap appears to rest naturally on the man's head, following the contour of his skull like a typical flat cap should, without any signs of misalignment or unnatural positioning.",
