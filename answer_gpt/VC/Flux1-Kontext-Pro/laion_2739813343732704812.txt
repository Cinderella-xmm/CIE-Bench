    "Question": "Q1: Is there a visible gular pouch located beneath the lower mandible of the beak?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object depicted is a cartoon representation of a pelican. Cartoon illustrations often simplify or exaggerate features for stylistic reasons. The beak is shown with a straight line, and there is no distinct representation of a gular pouch beneath the lower mandible. In realistic depictions of pelicans, the gular pouch is a prominent feature used to catch fish. Given this simplified representation, the absence of a visible gular pouch is noted.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the feet clearly webbed with visible claws at the tips of each toe?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the feet of the cartoon pelican are drawn in a simplified manner typical of cartoon illustrations, with no distinct webbing or claws. Webbed feet and claws are common features of real pelicans, but in this cartoon style, simplification leads to the absence of detailed features.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the feathers on the body composed of layered, striated structures with visible individual feather shafts and overlapping edges?",
    "explanation": "The feathers in Image B are represented in a cartoon style.

The lack of fine detail and the use of blocks of color further support this choice.",

    "Question": "Q5: Are both legs positioned under the body, supporting the pelican in a grounded standing pose?",
