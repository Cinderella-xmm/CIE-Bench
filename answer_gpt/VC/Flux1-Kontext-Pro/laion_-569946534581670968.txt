    "Question": "Q1: Is the golden-brown color present on the plush chicken wings?",
    "explanation": "Based on Image B, the plush chicken wings have a uniform orange coloration rather than a varied golden-brown hue. The orange is consistent across the plush material, lacking the toasted or browned appearance typical of cooked chicken. Combining this with common knowledge on plush toys, which usually retain a single color for aesthetic reasons, we conclude the absence of golden-brown color.",
