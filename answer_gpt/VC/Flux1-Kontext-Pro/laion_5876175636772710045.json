      "question": "Is the man's left arm still wrapped around the woman's back, supporting her in a ballroom dance hold?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man and woman are standing in a formal pose, rather than a ballroom dance hold. The woman's hands are resting on the man's chest and shoulders, suggesting an affectionate and posed position rather than an active dance. The formal attire and the setting further support a pose fit for a portrait rather than a dance. Therefore, the man's arm is not wrapped around her in a dance hold.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the man and woman are standing upright in a straight pose. The woman's back is not arched, and her legs are both firmly on the ground, indicated by the formal pose they hold in the elegant setting. There is no indication of any leg being lifted.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's blonde hair is styled to fall down her back and over her shoulder, suitable for a formal portrait. It does not appear to be flowing outward to the right, reflecting a static rather than dynamic appearance.",
