      "question": "Is the main subject of the new scene (seaside café elements) centrally positioned on the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the main subject, which is the smartphone in a charging dock, is positioned centrally on the table. The table's edges are visible, suggesting the subject is centered. Given commonly staged photography, central positioning is typical to emphasize the subject; thus, the world knowledge supports this observation.",

      "question": "Does the new scene retain a clean and minimalistic style with no extraneous objects or clutter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the scene depicts a table with only a smartphone on a charging dock. The background objects are minimal. The scene aligns with a minimalistic aesthetic, characterized by simple, uncluttered visuals. Using world knowledge of minimalistic design principles, this scene fits the description well.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the perspective and composition of the new scene consistent with the original, providing a clear view of the seaside café tabletop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the main subject position and angle are similar, providing a clear view of the tabletop. New scene elements like the beach backdrop do not obstruct the view. Such composition is typical in photography for showing table settings, supporting consistency in perspective.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there distinct sunlight reflections visible on the table surface in the new scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is indicative of direct sunlight as seen from the brighter spots on the table's surface. Sunlight reflections appear more pronounced near the smartphone dock. Knowledge of outdoor environments under sunlight helps identify these bright patches as reflections.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Can you see subtle sea wave reflections in the background or on the table surface in the new scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a coastal setting with visible waves in the background. However, the table surface does not show reflections of these waves. Objects typically reflect direct light rather than distant scenery like waves, except under specific lighting conditions. Given the information visible in the image, sea wave reflections are not apparent.",
