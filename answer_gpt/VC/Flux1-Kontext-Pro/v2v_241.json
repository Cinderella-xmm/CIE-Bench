      "question": "Is the horse depicted standing on the elephant's back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is clearly placed atop the elephant's back. The positioning and balance display an unusual scenario, but visually, the horse's legs are shown resting on the elephant's body. Common understanding and analysis of the composition show that the horse appears to be standing due to its upright position and alignment with both the elephant and the ground level.",

      "question": "Is the elephant shown in a posture that supports the horse on its back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the elephant remains in a standard standing posture, which is typically stable and broad enough to suggest support for a horse. The visual cues, such as the elephant's flat back and substantial body, indicate a posture that can theoretically accommodate the horse's weight, despite this being an unusual real-life scenario.",

      "question": "Does the background retain a photorealistic appearance with a grassy field and sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background shows a natural setting featuring a grassy field and a blue sky with clouds, which maintains a photorealistic quality. The elements of the scene align with world knowledge of typical outdoor environments, making it coherent and realistic in terms of landscape depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the spatial relationship between the horse and elephant preserved, with the horse positioned above the elephant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is positioned directly above the elephant, maintaining the spatial relationship visible in such compositions. Visual analysis shows the horse physically on top of the elephant, indicating that their relative positions are preserved accurately within the edited context.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Is the scene displayed within an ornate photo frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly contains a photo frame surrounding the scene, which appears ornate with detailed design elements along the edges. The visual presence of this frame suggests that the scene is presented in a framed format, which goes beyond a basic display.",
