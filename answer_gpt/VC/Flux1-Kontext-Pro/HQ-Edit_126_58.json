      "question": "Is the neck of the swan-shaped object still curved in an elegant S-shape, extending upward and backward from the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is no longer a swan but rather a perfume bottle labeled 'Winter Glow.' The neck of the swan-shaped object is not visible because it has been replaced by the neck of the bottle, which is vertical and cylindrical. Based on this observation, the original elegant S-shaped curvature of the swan's neck is no longer present.",

      "question": "Are the pink berry-like accents visible on the evergreen sprigs surrounding the base of the swan?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are still pink berry-like accents present on the evergreen sprigs surrounding the base of the perfume bottle. This is evident from the visual cues of small, pink elements among the green of the evergreen, demonstrating that these decorative features have been retained in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is there a white snowflake-shaped ornament located near the base of the swan?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white snowflake-shaped ornament that was present in Image A near the base of the swan has been removed in the editing process. The base of the perfume bottle is adorned with evergreen sprigs and pink berries, but no snowflake ornament is visible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle is placed on a textured, snow-covered surface, similar to what was in place for the swan in Image A. Both images depict the object resting on snow, showing that the surface texture has remained consistent between the images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, like Image A, features blurred silhouettes of people in the background, set against vibrant strings of colorful, glowing lights. This setup contributes to a festive and lively atmosphere in the scene depicted, consistent between both images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the swan shape is no longer present, as it has been replaced by a perfume bottle. Therefore, there is no swan head to be oriented in any direction. The question refers to an aspect of Image A that does not apply after the editing change.",
