        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the number 'J244' is distinctly marked on the side of the ship within the glass dome. This detail is accurately replicated just like in a ship model, providing clear visibility. The positioning is consistent with what one would expect on a ship's hull.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background context commonly seen in a real harbor, like large white port cranes, is not present, as it focuses on a smaller scale model encased in glass.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features tiny figurines accompanying the model ship, resembling individuals walking along a pier. The positioning and context suggest three figures similar to those observed in real-world settings.",
