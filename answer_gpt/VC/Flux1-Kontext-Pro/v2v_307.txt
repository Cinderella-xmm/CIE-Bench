    "Question": "Q2: Is the central adhesive strip still present in the same relative position and size?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central adhesive strip is visible and centered on the bandage, similar to common adhesive bandage designs. The strip's position and size seem proportionate to the bandage size, retaining its characteristic placement and coverage area as common in bandage designs. Comparing this to Image A, which also features a centrally positioned strip, there is no noticeable change in its relative positioning or proportional size.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Does the bandage retain its visible fabric texture?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the bandage with a visible texture that resembles fabric, indicating that it retains the tactile and visual texture consistent with typical fabric bandages. This texture suggests a degree of realism, as this is the expected material for such bandages. Image A also displays a similar texture, supporting the consistent use of fabric texture in both images.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is there a shadow cast by the bandage, contributing to its three-dimensional appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bandage is depicted without a prominent shadow, suggesting a more two-dimensional representation against the context of the photograph. This differs from Image A, where directional lighting creates a distinct shadow, enhancing its three-dimensional perspective. Thus, the perceived three-dimensionality due to shadow in Image B is diminished.",
    "answer": "No"
