      "question": "Are the carrot slices clearly circular in shape with visible concentric rings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot slices can be observed as having distinct circular shapes. The concentric rings within the slices are visibly highlighted through variations in orangeness, a characteristic commonly associated with sliced carrots. This observation is made through analyzing the geometric circumference of each slice, which is uniformly round, in addition to the visible texture displayed within each slice.",

      "question": "Do the cauliflower florets retain their natural branching structure and clustered bud formation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cauliflower florets display recognizable branching, which is normally seen in fresh cauliflower. Each floret consists of a dense aggregation of buds culminating from a singular stem, demonstrating typical cauliflower morphology. Observing these natural structures, we can infer the cauliflower in the image has retained its characteristic structural integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are all the carrots and cauliflower florets contained within the bowl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows both the carrot and cauliflower pieces entirely within the boundary of the bowl, which is made of transparent material. The pieces do not extend over or outside the rim of the bowl, ensuring they are fully contained inside. The bowl's interiors hold all vegetable slices visibly, efficiently showcasing them within the context of the enclosed space.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the arrangement of vegetables in the bowl natural and non-symmetrical, with both carrots and cauliflower present in similar quantities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement appears naturally distributed without evident symmetry. The carrots and cauliflower florets are dispersed across the bowl, forming a casual display without forced ordered patterns. However, analyzing the quantities of each vegetable type, we see approximately equal representation of carrots and cauliflower florets, confirming their balanced appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the carrots distinctly orange and the cauliflower distinctly white in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot slices have a bright orange hue, and the cauliflower pieces contrast with a plain white. This color distinction aligns with typical characteristics expected from raw carrots and cauliflower. The visible colors are identifiable and separated by nature, assisting viewers in discernment based solely on their occurring recognizable colors.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there multiple distinct carrot slices and cauliflower florets visible in the bowl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several carrot slices and cauliflower florets can be individually counted. The ensemble includes multiple individual carrot slices and cauliflower florets, confirming the variety and multiplicity of such pieces within the bowl. This allows visual verification of abundance and diversity in terms of the respective vegetable pieces visually present.",
