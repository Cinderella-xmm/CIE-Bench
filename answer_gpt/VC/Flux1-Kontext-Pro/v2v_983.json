    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the tan and black fur color distribution, particularly the tan face and legs with black back, preserved in the creature’s design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature maintains the same color distribution as seen in Image A. The legs and face are prominently tan, and a dark (black) region is visible on the back, supporting this observation. By analyzing the coloring in Image B, the design has ensured that the key elements of the tan and black distribution are retained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floppy ears, with their rounded shape and downward angle, preserved in the creature’s head design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ears of the creature are depicted as floppy with a rounded shape and are angled downwards. This matches the original description and appearance of the dog's ears in Image A, indicating that these features have been preserved.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the open mouth with a visible pink tongue and exposed teeth preserved in the creature’s facial expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the blur covering part of the face, the visible portion of the tongue hanging out is characterized by its pink color, similar to the dog in Image A. The detail of exposed teeth is not as clear, but the general expression with an open mouth and a pink tongue has been captured.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the blue collar with a black buckle present on the creature, either as part of its design or reflected in the orb’s color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the creature with a blue collar around its neck, which matches the collar on the dog in Image A. The color scheme is maintained in the creature’s design, ensuring continuity between the two images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the creature depicted in a lying-down pose with front paws extended forward, mirroring the dog’s original posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature is depicted in a standing position rather than a lying-down posture, as it is interacting with a ball. This is a departure from the dog's pose in Image A, where it is lying down with its front paws extended.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the dark eyes, dark nose, and tan muzzle preserved in the creature’s facial structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B has a tan muzzle, similar to the dog in Image A. Despite the facial blur, it can be inferred from the visible parts of the design and the use of color that these features are likely preserved. However, due to the blur, the visibility of the eyes and nose cannot be assured.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B captures similar proportions to those of the dog in Image A. The shape and musculature are consistent with a medium-sized animal, retaining the broad chest and defined back. This similarity is maintained in the artwork.",
