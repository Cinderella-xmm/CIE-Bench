    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the skater depicted in a mid-air crouched posture with both arms extended outward for balance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater is depicted performing a trick mid-air. He is in a crouched posture, suggesting he is undertaking a maneuver that involves jumping or flipping. The arms are bent but up in front, indicating some dynamic movement commonly associated with maintaining balance when airborne on a skateboard. From the posture and positioning, it's reasonable to conclude that the skater's arms are positioned for balance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the skater’s left foot placed firmly on the skateboard while the right foot is slightly raised off the board?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both feet are firmly placed on the skateboard, which is typical for maintaining control during an aerial trick. There is no evident raising of one foot from the skateboard, the image shows the skater's feet on the board consistently.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the skater’s head and eyes look toward the right side of the frame, indicating forward momentum?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater's body orientation reflects forward movement generally found in skateboarding. However, since facial details are blurred, it's not possible to discern the exact direction of the gaze, making it difficult to confirm a specific forward momentum indicated through head orientation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the skater positioned above the surface of the ramp, indicating he is airborne?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B confirm that the skater is depicted above the ramp, reinforcing the concept of an airborne maneuver. This is apparent as the skateboard is seen elevated above the ramp surface, a common portrayal for tricks performed in air.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a second person, an older man in a dark jacket, visible in the background running across the ramp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict any additional figures other than the main skater. In contrast to Image A, where another person is clearly visible, Image B distinctly focuses solely on the skater without any other individuals present in the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a curved ramp structure forming a bowl-like shape in the foreground, beneath the skater?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination of Image B, a bowl-like structure can be discerned. The curves of the ramp below the skater suggest a bowl-shaped form frequently found in skateparks. The presence of the ramp, including its curvature, is evident beneath the skater.",
