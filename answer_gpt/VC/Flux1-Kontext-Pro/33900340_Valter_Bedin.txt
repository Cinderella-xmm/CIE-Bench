    "Question": "Q1: Is the central archway positioned at the center of the main structure, forming a passageway between the two vertical pillars?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central archway appears prominently, positioned between two vertical structures, suggesting it is centrally located. This placement is typical for such architectural features, where an archway forms a passageway between supporting pillars. By assessing the visual context, it seems to serve as a focal point within the structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the two vertical pillars standing symmetrically on either side of the central archway, forming a tall, narrow gateway?",
    "explanation": "The two vertical structures on either side of the central archway indicate symmetrical positioning, creating a classic gateway appearance. Architectural symmetry often features in such designs to provide balance and harmony, commonly used in gateways.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the battlements along the top of the structure composed of repeating rectangular merlons and gaps (crenels)?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the structure exhibits battlements with typical crenellations, featuring merlons and gaps which are indicative of medieval defensive architecture. These are commonly seen in castles and fortifications, providing both defense and aesthetic structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a long, low brick wall running parallel to the main structure on the left side of the image?",
    "explanation": "A low wall is visible on the left side of Image B, running parallel to the right main structure. This wall separates another area and is a common feature in such environments, offering division and structural balance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a paved pathway extending from the foreground toward the central archway, running between the low wall and the main structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pathway appears to extend from the foreground towards the archway, nestled between the parallel low wall on the left and the main structure. Such pathways guide viewers' focus toward central elements and are consistent in architectural designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there additional arched openings visible to the right of the main central archway, integrated into the same wall structure?",
    "explanation": "Image B does show additional arches in the wall structure to the right of the central archway, which is often seen in designs where multiple access points or decorative uses of arches are integrated into the same main structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the small human figure located on the pathway, positioned behind the viewer and moving toward the central archway?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette of a small human figure is seen along the pathway, oriented towards the central archway, appearing to move in that direction. The placement and posture suggest movement toward the structure, typical of pathways leading to key architectural features.",
    "answer": "Yes"
