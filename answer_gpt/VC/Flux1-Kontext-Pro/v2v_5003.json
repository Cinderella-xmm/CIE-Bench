        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bow is visibly retaining its characteristic curved structure, which is typical for this type of equipment, used to store and release tension for shooting an arrow. The curve is evident from the way the limbs are bent back towards a central point where the string is attached. Analyzing Image A, the bow also presents a curved shape. By comparing both images, it's noticeable that the curvature is maintained in both instances, indicating that Image B retains the curved shape of the bow as seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the cylindrical shape of the quiver?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quiver is seen as having a cylindrical shape, characterized by a circular base and straight sides that form a long tube for holding arrows. This is evident when viewing the arrows that are placed upright within this cylindrical form. Analyzing Image A, the quiver similarly retains a cylindrical form. Thus, when comparing both images, it is clear that the cylindrical shape remains consistent in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrows are visible with feathers at the top, arranged in an upright position within the quiver. The feathers appear to be arranged in a neat, organized manner, which is a common arrangement for arrows stored in a quiver for easy access. Examining Image A, the arrows maintain a similar upright and organized arrangement. By comparing the images, the arrangement and the general form of the arrows are retained in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bow and quiver are clearly placed on the green, forest floor, a setup that suggests they have been set down for rest or display in a natural environment. Image A shows a similar placement with the bow and quiver positioned similarly on the forest floor. The comparison indicates that both the position relative to each other and on the forest floor is maintained in Image B as seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the natural woodland backdrop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backdrop consists of a lush forest with a blurred background, giving the scene a deep, forest-like appearance typical of natural woodland settings. This is characterized by the presence of trees and a softly blurred background representing depth. In Image A, the natural woodland setting is similarly represented. The comparison reveals that both images convey a consistent natural woodland backdrop, retained in Image B.",
