      "question": "Does the zebra retain its black and white stripe pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra displays the characteristic black and white stripes that are distinct across its body. This pattern is crucial for identifying zebras, providing camouflage and protection from predators in their natural environment. The clear presence of these stripes allows us to affirm that the zebra has retained its pattern.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the zebra's body structure, including its legs and torso, intact?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the zebra with a complete body structure, including its legs and torso. The zebra's pose is natural as it bends to drink water. This stance requires intact legs and torso to maintain balance and posture, which are visibly present in the image.",

      "model_answer": "yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the watering hole still present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible section of water near the zebra, indicative of a watering hole. Its presence is deduced from the reflection seen in the water and the surrounding earthen bank, signifying the continuity of a natural setting for the zebra's drinking activity.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the surrounding rocks and dry earth background still visible?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts similar earth texture and the arrangement of rocks around the zebra, as seen in its natural habitat. These environmental elements provide context for the zebra's setting, confirming that these are still visible and consistent with the dry earth background typically found in savannah or arid landscapes.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "The tail of the zebra in Image B is visible and maintains its natural shape and position, hanging near its hind legs. This detail confirms the authenticity of the zebra's anatomy, as the tail is crucial for swatting away flies and other insects, contributing to its natural appearance.",
