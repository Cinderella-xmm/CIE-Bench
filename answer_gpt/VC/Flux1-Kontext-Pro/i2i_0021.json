      "question": "Are the three sheep positioned near each other, with one adult sheep interacting closely with the two younger ones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi sheep are standing side by side, with no apparent physical interaction. They appear as equal sized, stylized cartoon figures rather than being categorized strictly into adults and younger ones. The visual information along with world knowledge of chibi art style suggests they are designed to appear together as a set, but there are no visible gestures or movements indicating interaction.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep are depicted in a chibi style, which usually includes exaggerated features such as a rounded body and small legs.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction in Image B uses a cartoon, chibi style, where the simplicity of design aims to capture the essence of the subject.
