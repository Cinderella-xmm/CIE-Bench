      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the front hood of the car is visible and there appears to be a small logo at the center of the hood. The design and placement are consistent with a typical McLaren logo as seen on McLaren vehicles. Associating this with world knowledge of car branding, it is logical to conclude that the visible mark is the McLaren logo.",

      "question": "Are the front headlights shaped as narrow, trapezoidal units with sharp edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the headlights can be observed. Their shape is consistent with what can be described as narrow and trapezoidal with sharp, angular edges. This design is aligned with modern sports car headlight styling. Utilizing knowledge of automotive design, these characteristics strongly suggest the headlights are both narrow and trapezoidal with sharp edges.",

      "question": "Are red brake calipers visible behind the black multi-spoke wheels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels are visibly designed with multiple spokes, and red components are seen behind them. Based on the common design practices of sports cars, red brake calipers often signify performance brakes. Therefore, the visible red elements indicate the presence of red brake calipers.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a black angular side air intake vent running along the door line?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays an angular shape along the side of the car that closely follows the door's line and appears to be an air intake vent typically used for cooling systems in high-performance vehicles. Combining this observation with familiarity with the design of high-performance cars, this appears to be a black side air intake vent.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the car painted in a metallic silver finish with visible surface reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the car in Image B is reflective and has a silver color indicative of a metallic finish. Such finishes are typical in luxury and sports cars, allowing for visual surface reflections, which are noticeable in this image. This suggests a metallic silver finish.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the car have a visible dihedral door line extending from the front fender to the rear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the door line is shaped such that it implies a dihedral design, characteristic of certain sports cars wherein the door hinge system is a unique feature. Its design extends from the front towards the rear. Reconciling this with world knowledge of car body design, it corresponds to a dihedral door line.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the car proportioned with a long front hood and short rear deck, characteristic of a mid-engine layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The proportions in Image B suggest a relatively balanced length between the front hood and rear deck rather than an elongated hood typical of a front-engine layout. Sports cars with mid-engine layouts often display such proportions, focusing the weight distribution towards the center of the car. Interpreting this through automotive design principles, the car fits the characteristics of a mid-engine layout.",
