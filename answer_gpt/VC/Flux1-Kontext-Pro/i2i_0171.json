      "question": "Is the skier’s dynamic skiing pose, including bent knees and forward lean, retained in the figurine?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurines showcase a skiing pose similar to the skier in Image A. Both figurines display bent knees and a forward-leaning posture, essential for a dynamic skiing action. This is evident through the positioning of the figurines, which imitate real skiing maneuvers. The resemblance in posture indicates the dynamic skiing pose is indeed retained in the figurine.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

This accurate representation suggests that the figurine effectively showcases the skier's outfit.",
