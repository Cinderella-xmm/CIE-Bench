      "question": "Is the ogre's skin still greenish-gray in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ogre's skin appears to be a solid, bright green color, departing from a greenish-gray hue. This bright and uniform color is characteristic of a cartoon or figurine design, rather than a textured or realistic look. Therefore, based on the visual cue of the skin color in Image B, the answer is 'No'.",

      "question": "Do the ogre’s eyes retain their red glowing appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ogre's eyes are not visible, but the image seems to represent a figurine where typically such glowing features are not present. Thus, without specific depiction, it can be inferred they do not retain the red glowing appearance common in realistic or dynamic artistic depictions. Thus, the answer is 'No'.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ogre's ears remain visibly pointed. The pointed shape is depicted distinctly in the design, suggesting continuity in this specific characteristic. Hence, the answer is 'Yes'.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the ogre wearing a stylized loincloth, maintaining the visual element of edges that suggest a worn or tattered look, typical of how a cartoon or figurine might depict such details. Given this depiction, the answer is 'Yes'.",

      "question": "Is the ogre wearing a thick belt with a circular carved buckle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ogre in Image B clearly wears a thick belt with a circular, prominent buckle. This design feature has been visually emphasized in the figurine style depiction. Thus, the answer is 'Yes'.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the ogre have coarse dark fur covering its arms and legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ogre lacks the depiction of coarse dark fur on its arms and legs, which would typically add texture in a detailed artistic rendering. Here, the figurine’s clean and smooth surface represents a departure from the fur texture. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ogre’s hands are positioned to mimic the act of holding objects or weapons, particularly the hand holding a mace-like object. This posture is consistent with gripping weapons. Thus, the answer is 'Yes'.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ogre in Image B displays a highly muscular and bulky physique, characteristic of a stylized figurine emphasizing exaggerated muscles and size. This suggests retention of the original muscular and bulky build aspect. Thus, the answer is 'Yes'.",
