    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the donut-shaped object retaining a circular form with a central hole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects are illustrated cartoon donuts, which maintain a circular form typical of a donut with a central hole, consistent with the visual elements in the scene where round donuts have been anthropomorphized into knights. Thus, the circular form with a central hole is clearly retained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the donut retain its golden-brown baked color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon donuts depicted do not exhibit a realistic golden-brown baked color; instead, they have a stylized appearance with a more uniform, cartoonish coloration typical of animated illustrations. Considering this stylization, the depiction does not aim to retain the realistic appearance associated with baked donuts.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the surface of the donut covered in visible coarse granulated sugar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the cartoon depiction of Image B, the surface of the donuts exhibits simplified, stylized sprinkles as opposed to realistic, coarse granulated sugar. The artistic representation prioritizes a cartoon look rather than detailed granulation, thus not showing granulated sugar.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible individual sugar granules on the donut’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the illustrated donuts do not feature visible individual sugar granules but rather have an overall smooth depiction typical of cartoon illustrations, emphasizing stylized patterns instead of realistic sugar textures.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the donut’s body formed as a continuous ring with a central opening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows cartoon donuts that have been anthropomorphized yet still retain the foundational shape of a continuous ring with a clear central opening, aligning with the traditional donut form though presented in a humorous, illustrative manner.",
