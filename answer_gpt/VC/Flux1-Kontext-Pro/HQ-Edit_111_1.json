      "question": "Is the subject’s hair styled in a tight bun at the back of her head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject’s hairstyle appears tightly pulled back and gathered at the back. The shape and position of the hair resemble a bun, which is common in athletic contexts to keep hair secured.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color and style of the top in Image B are consistent with a sleeveless, beige crop top, as it ends above the waist, exposing the stomach area. The visual cues confirm that the top is indeed sleeveless and exposes the midriff, which aligns with the description of a crop top.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the shorts covering the area above the hips with a visible gathered elastic band at the top. This characteristic is typical of high-waisted shorts, and the presence of the elastic band indicates the type of waistband.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both of the subject’s hands, covered with boxing gloves, are raised around her face area. This posture is characteristic of a defensive stance in boxing, as it protects the head and upper body from strikes.",

    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a distinct horizontal red line running across the foreground of the image. Given the context of a boxing setting, this line can be interpreted as representing the rope on the edge of a boxing ring.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both hands of the subject are covered by red boxing gloves. The gloves appear to have wrist coverage which suggests the presence of wrist straps typical of boxing gloves, used for securing the gloves in place.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the subject’s face showing a focused, intense expression with eyes directed forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since the face in Image B is blurred, it is not possible to discern any expression or determine the direction of the subject's gaze. Therefore, any assumptions about facial expressions would not be evidence-based.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The midriff of the subject in Image B is exposed due to the crop top, revealing a toned abdominal area with visible muscle definition. The lighting and shading accentuate the muscle definition, confirming this observation.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject in Image B has a skin tone that appears quite stylized, with a heavy use of contrasting highlights and shadows typical of illustrated or comic art. This suggests that the tones are not entirely natural but enhanced for artistic effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Even though the face is blurred in Image B, the position and alignment of the subject's shoulders and neck suggest that her head is turned slightly to her right. The general positioning indicates a forward-facing direction aligned with traditional boxing stances.",
