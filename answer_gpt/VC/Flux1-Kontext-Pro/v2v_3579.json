      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are sushi pieces featured in a mosaic pattern. Some of these pieces have an orange-pink color that is characteristic of salmon.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sushi pieces are arranged to form a human figure. These sushi pieces have cylindrical shapes which are characteristic of maki rolls. Additionally, the fillings in some rolls appear green, consistent with the appearance of cucumber or avocado, or yellow-orange, which may represent fish or other sushi ingredients. Thus, using common sushi roll knowledge, maki rolls are present with the described features.",
