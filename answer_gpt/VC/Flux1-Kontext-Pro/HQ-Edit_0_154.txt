    "Question": "Q1: Is the U.S. $20 bill with its distinctive green color, \"20\" numeral, and architectural design visible in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the banknotes displayed above the wallet are represented with line sketches rather than their actual color schemes and design details. While the '20' numeral can still be identified due to its position and shape, the absence of color and precise architectural features means that the specific U.S. $20 bill features are not visually recognizable. Therefore, although the numeral is present, it isn't distinctly recognizable as a U.S. $20 bill without its characteristic green color and design.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the Qatari Riyal note with its pink-orange hue, Arabic script, and serial number \"103 01\" present and recognizable?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the banknotes are depicted as monochrome line sketches. Though the outline of a banknote similar to the shape of the Qatari Riyal could be hypothesized, the critical elements such as the pink-orange color, Arabic script, and the specific serial number '103 01' are not discernible due to the lack of color and design details. Thus, this makes it not recognizable as a Qatari Riyal note.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the Indian Rupee 50 note with the lion capital symbol and yellow-brown color clearly visible?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the representation of the banknotes is in a grayscale sketch format, lacking the specific color, symbolism, and detailed design elements that are crucial for identifying the Indian Rupee 50 note with lion capital and yellow-brown color. As these identifying qualities aren't present, the Indian Rupee 50 note isn't clearly visible.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the U.S. $1 bill with the portrait of George Washington and \"ONE DOLLAR\" text present?",
    "explanation": "The U.S. $1 bill, known for its portrait of George Washington and 'ONE DOLLAR' text, is not clearly visible because the edited image depicts the notes in monochrome sketches lacking these specific features. Although a note similar in form could be part of the sketches, the absence of these distinct identifiers makes it unrecognizable as a U.S. $1 bill.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are all four banknotes (U.S. $20, Qatari Riyal, Indian Rupee 50, U.S. $1) present together in the same visual space?",
    "explanation": "The combined representation of various currencies like the U.S. $20 bill, Qatari Riyal, Indian Rupee 50, and U.S. $1 is only assumed by their structured stacking in the visual space. However, due to the abstraction of details and color in the edited image, which uses line sketches, these specific notes aren't discernibly together as the original image represents them. The absence of color and distinct features makes it difficult to definitively confirm their simultaneous presence.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the original dominant colors of the banknotes (green for USD, pink-orange for QAR, yellow-brown for INR) preserved?",
    "explanation": "The edited image uses a monochromatic line sketch to represent the banknotes, stripping away the original colors of each currency, such as green for the U.S. Dollar, pink-orange for the Qatari Riyal, and yellow-brown for the Indian Rupee. These dominant colors are not preserved; hence, the notes are not identifiable by their typical hues.",
    "answer": "No"
