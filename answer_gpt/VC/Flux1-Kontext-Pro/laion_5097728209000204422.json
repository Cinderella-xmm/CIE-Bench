      "question": "Are the rectangular-framed glasses present on the subject's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any visual cues that suggest the presence of rectangular-framed glasses. The blurred face area in Image B prevents us from determining this characteristic, but we can infer from the lack of visible glasses elsewhere that they are not present.",

    },
    {

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show a beard or mustache in the region where they would typically appear. The face is obscured, but there are no evident facial hair textures or shades present in the visible areas that might suggest their presence.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a ring visible on the ring finger of the subject's left hand. This observation is drawn from the clear depiction of the hands, where a ring can distinctly be seen.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands of the subject are depicted with a natural skin tone and the proportions are consistent with a realistic representation. The hand holding the ornate object appears naturally positioned and detailed.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the facial structure, including the nose, jawline, and eye spacing, consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the blurred face in both images, it is challenging to compare facial structures precisely, but considering the context in Image B, these features are intentionally obscured or otherwise stylized to suit the artistic representation of the subject.",
