      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which is an illustration resembling a fantasy map, there is a set of castle images that do not resemble a traditional flowchart or sitemap with labeled nodes. There is mention of 'Homepage' near the top center, but it does not exhibit a typical central root node structure as seen in organizational or sitemap diagrams.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the map-like illustration does not have a flowchart with branches or nodes. It depicts a fantasy scene with castles and paths, lacking any labeled branches or connections resembling 'PRODUCTS & SOLUTIONS,' 'ABOUT US,' 'EVENTS & RESOURCES,' 'SUCCESS STORIES,' and 'CONTACT US.' The imagery does not convey the information architecture as described.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a fantasy-style illustration and does not include structured elements such as a 'SITE MAP KEY' or any form of legend with color codes. It is more of a stylized map without detailed information typically found in structured diagrams.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a whimsical, illustrative map scene without structured components like a footer section containing 'Privacy Policy' or 'Site Map.' Such elements are typical in corporate documents or web designs but do not fit the theme of a fantasy landscape.",
