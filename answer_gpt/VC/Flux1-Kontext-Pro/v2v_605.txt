    "Question": "Q1: Is the gorilla depicted with predominantly dark gray to black fur?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object in question is not an actual gorilla but rather a stylized toy representation called 'Jungle King.' The depicted figure uses a color palette commonly associated with gorillas in popular culture—dark gray to black. This color choice aligns with typical gorilla depictions in toys and media. Therefore, the toy is visually represented in the image with a dark gray tone, imitating a gorilla's fur.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the gorilla have dark, almost black skin on its face?",
    "explanation": "Image B, which shows a stylized toy version, suggests the gorilla-like figure may have been designed with an intention to mirror real-life gorilla traits, like dark facial skin. The 'Jungle King' figure would logically have dark or black skin on its face, a typical trait of gorilla imagery despite the blurred face.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the gorilla shown with a broad, muscular chest and visible pectoral definition?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Jungle King' toy figure represents a gorilla with distinctively broad chest features and emphasis on musculature, typical of action-like figures emulating powerful animals. The muscular depiction of the chest is exaggerated to align with popular portrayals of gorilla strength.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is there a lighter-colored area on the gorilla’s back and shoulders, indicative of a silverback?",
    "explanation": "The toy figure in Image B, called 'Jungle King,' does not show any characteristics of a silverback gorilla, which typically includes lighter coloration on the back. The shown figure lacks any visible lighter area on its back and shoulders, maintaining a consistent dark color throughout.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the gorilla have a broad, flat nose and prominent brow ridges?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a 'Jungle King' toy. Despite the face being blurred, these figurines often emphasize simplified and pronounced features such as broad noses and distinct brow ridges to convey a gorilla-like appearance. However, due to the blur, these specific features cannot be confirmed.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the gorilla’s hands placed on its chest in a dominant stance?",
    "explanation": "The 'Jungle King' toy figure in Image B conveys a posture where the arms are down, differing from the dominant stance of pounding chest seen in real gorilla behavior. The toy is holding a staff instead, suggesting a different characterization.",
