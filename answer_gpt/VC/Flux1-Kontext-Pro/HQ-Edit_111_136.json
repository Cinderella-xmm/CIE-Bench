      "question": "Is the dancer depicted with her left leg lifted and bent at the knee, while her right foot remains planted on the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is depicted with her left leg lifted and bent at the knee. Her right foot is firmly planted on the ground, which is a typical pose in dance movements that require balance and grace. This assessment is made by examining the dancer's posture and the positioning of her legs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dancer positioned on the right side of the image, facing toward the left side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is indeed positioned on the right side of the image. Her body is angled such that it appears she is facing towards the left side of the frame. This analysis is supported by the orientation of her torso and limbs, which suggests movement in that direction.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the skirt of the dancer appear to be flared outward and upward due to motion, suggesting a spinning or leaping movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dancer's skirt in Image B is flared outward and upward, which suggests that she is either spinning or in the middle of a leaping motion. The flaring of the skirt is a typical effect of rotational or vertical motion, indicating dynamic movement.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the dancer positioned in the foreground, with a group of animals in the midground and trees in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition shows the dancer prominently in the foreground. Behind her in the midground are a group of animals, likely antelopes, and in the background, distinctively shaped trees create a layered visual depth typical of savannah landscapes. This positioning of elements is often used to give a sense of environmental context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the light source coming from the right side of the image, illuminating the dancer and casting shadows to the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting suggests that the source is indeed coming from the right side. This is evidenced by the way the dancer is illuminated, with brighter highlights on her right side and shadows cast toward the left, a common way to depict a light source from the side in art and photography.",
