    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the herringbone-patterned wooden floor present and accurately rendered in the same layout and orientation as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floor retains the herringbone pattern indicating a traditional parquet style, similar to Image A. The orientation and layout of these planks are consistent with Image A, maintaining the symmetry and geometric arrangement of the pattern. The visual information in Image B matches world knowledge of parquet flooring patterns.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the vertical and horizontal moldings of the wall paneling preserved, including the recessed rectangular panels and crown molding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A visual examination of Image B shows rectangular panels and crown molding similar to Image A. These elements closely adhere to classical interior design features and draw from knowledge of architectural moldings, indicating preservation of the paneling's structure and design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the oval-shaped skylight or oculus at the top of the spiral staircase still present and positioned centrally above the coil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any skylight or staircase, as it features a coiled dragon instead. The original skylight in Image A is not replicated in Image B, where the scene is entirely of a dragon composition without any elements of a staircase or skylight.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the graphite pencil visible in the lower-right corner of the image, angled diagonally across the drawingâ€™s border?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a graphite pencil can be seen in the lower-right corner, angled diagonally similar to Image A. Its presence suggests an artistic representation, as observed through visual cues and knowledge of artistic techniques often depicting tools used for creation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the thin ruled border enclosing the entire drawing present, with short perpendicular lines at each corner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image B and Image A feature a ruled border enclosing the drawing with perpendicular corner lines. This detail is typical in sketches or architectural designs to delineate the work area, and these framing lines are consistently represented in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the perspective of the scene maintain convergence toward the oval skylight at the top, with all architectural lines aligning accordingly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include any skylight nor architectural alignment towards it, as the image revolves around a dragon illustration. This differs significantly from Image A, which had a stairway converging perspective towards a skylight, absent in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the tonal gradients on the walls and floor, particularly the darker shadows near the base and lighter areas under the skylight, preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows tonal gradients with variation in shading, but not specifically with regards to a skylight, as it lacks such architectural features. The emphasis on shadows around the dragon, akin to artistic shading techniques, does not directly correspond to gradients defined by architectural skylight placement as seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are the individual wooden planks of the floor rendered with fine parallel lines to indicate texture and grain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A close examination of Image B reveals that the floor planks are depicted with fine lines indicative of texture and grain, resembling traditional herringbone parquet detail observed in Image A. This fine detailing is consistent in both images, adhering to an understanding of texture representation in art.",
