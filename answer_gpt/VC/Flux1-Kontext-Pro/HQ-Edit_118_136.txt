    "Question": "Q1: Is the skater depicted in a mid-air crouched posture with both arms extended outward for balance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the skater is depicted performing a trick mid-air. He is in a crouched posture, suggesting he is undertaking a maneuver that involves jumping or flipping. The arms are bent but up in front, indicating some dynamic movement commonly associated with maintaining balance when airborne on a skateboard. From the posture and positioning, it's reasonable to conclude that the skater's arms are positioned for balance.",

    "Question": "Q3: Does the skater’s head and eyes look toward the right side of the frame, indicating forward momentum?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the skater's body orientation reflects forward movement generally found in skateboarding. However, since facial details are blurred, it's not possible to discern the exact direction of the gaze, making it difficult to confirm a specific forward momentum indicated through head orientation.",

    "Question": "Q6: Is there a curved ramp structure forming a bowl-like shape in the foreground, beneath the skater?",
    "explanation": "Upon examination of Image B, a bowl-like structure can be discerned. The curves of the ramp below the skater suggest a bowl-shaped form frequently found in skateparks. The presence of the ramp, including its curvature, is evident beneath the skater.",
    "answer": "Yes"
