    "Question": "Q1: Are there exactly five ducklings swimming in the foreground of the scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are five yellow figures in the foreground, resembling rubber ducklings, which suggests they are intended to represent ducks floating on water. However, they appear to be static, typical of rubber duck toys in a snow globe setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the ducklings have their heads above water and bodies partially submerged, indicating swimming motion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ducklings have their entire bodies above the water surface, cemented by the fact they are likely rubber ducks in a snow globe. This places them above the water rather than submerged, lacking realistic swimming motion.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the bed of smooth, rounded stones clearly visible beneath the water surface in the foreground?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe allows a clear view of the rounded stones below the water's surface in the foreground, consistent with typical snow globe designs where objects within are distinctly visible.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the reflection of the evergreen trees and sky clearly visible on the water surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the reflection of evergreen trees and sky is apparent on the water's surface due to the clarity and curvature within the snow globe, recreating an idyllic scene indicative of this type of miniature artistry.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are tall evergreen trees densely arranged along both sides of the lake, forming a natural corridor?",
    "explanation": "Image B portrays a dense arrangement of evergreen trees lining both sides of the water, typical of a natural corridor effect, even within the compact confines of a snow globe.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is a mist-covered mountain range visible in the background beyond the lake?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a mountain range is visible in the background, devoid of mist, allowing a clear view within the constrained perspective provided by the snow globe.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the dominant colors of the scene green (trees), blue-green (water), and brown (rocks)?",
    "explanation": "The color palette of Image B prominently features green from the trees, blue-green for the water, and the brown hue of the rocks, all accentuated by the dome and base of the snow globe, rendering a visually consistent representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
