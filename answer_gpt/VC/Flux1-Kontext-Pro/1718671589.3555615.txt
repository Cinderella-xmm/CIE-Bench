    "Question": "Q1: Is the central dome present and positioned directly above the main structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central dome is a prominent architectural feature that is directly positioned above the main structure. This is evident from the sphere shape resting atop the squared building structure, which is a common design choice for buildings with domes. Therefore, based on its position and appearance in the image, it confirms the central presence of the dome.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a golden star located at the very top of the dome’s spire?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays the top of the dome spire adorned with a golden star, which is a distinct and visible feature even when considering general architectural ornamentation. The golden star is situated at the peak of the spire, confirming its presence.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the windows arranged in a symmetrical grid pattern across the building’s front face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the windows on the building's front face are clearly arranged in a symmetrical grid pattern. This organization is typical of structured and orderly architectural designs, where window placement follows a consistent vertical and horizontal alignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a row of vertical columns forming a portico at the ground level of the building’s front?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the building with a row of vertical columns forming a portico at the ground level. This design feature is often used to give entrance prominence and can be seen where columns are a staple part of entry design, providing structural and visual emphasis.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there two large trees with golden-yellow foliage positioned symmetrically on both sides of the building?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are trees positioned around the building, but they are specifically decorative, likely indicative of model design rather than realistic foliage. The trees displayed are more abstract and covered in a sugar-like substance, not exhibiting specific foliage color as in outdoor settings.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a straight paved road running in front of the building, parallel to its base?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the context of the setup suggests that it is a model on a solid base, likely a wooden platform, rather than having a road or realistic surrounding conditions. Typically, roads are depicted in outdoor settings rather than model setups without streets.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the building have a square base with rounded corners on the upper levels before transitioning into the dome?",
    "explanation": "The architecture in Image B distinctly shows a building structure with a square base, which transitions upwards into rounded corners in the upper levels, culminating into a dome. This gradual shape change from straight to curved is typical when accommodating the shift from base to dome in architectural design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
