      "question": "Does the LEGO-style dog retain the golden color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO-style dog is depicted as a golden color, consistent with the typical color of a Golden Retriever. Based on the visual cues in the image and common knowledge of what a LEGO-style figure might look like, we can surmise that the dog is modeled to resemble its real-life counterpart's color.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the stop sign still octagonal in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a stop sign that retains its octagonal shape. This is the standard shape for stop signs worldwide, which helps in its recognition as a traffic sign associated with prohibiting passage. The visual cue of the distinctive eight-sided shape confirms it is still octagonal.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the stop sign retain the white \"STOP\" text?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stop sign features the white 'STOP' text, which is a standard element on traffic signs indicating a full stop is required. The clear visibility of the text supports the conclusion that it remains unchanged in content and color.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the LEGO-style dog still positioned sitting atop the stop sign?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cue in Image B shows the LEGO-style dog sitting atop the stop sign, in a similar position as might be expected of a real dog from Image A. The dog figure is displayed sitting upright, suggesting no change in its position relative to the stop sign.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background represented with gradient shading to depict the blue sky and clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is represented as a solid blue with simplified white cloud forms akin to a typical LEGO-style or diorama background, lacking gradient shading or realism. This stylized interpretation aligns with how skies can be depicted in toy models or illustrations.",
