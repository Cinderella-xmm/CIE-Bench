      "question": "Is the white-framed window visible on the front face of the transformed structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a fantasy creature whose central body resembles a structure but with no visible windows. The design of the structure merged with the creature does not feature conventional architectural elements such as a window, which is typically seen in buildings. Furthermore, the integration of fantastical elements along with the glow coming from beneath suggests it is part of the creature, not a traditional building facade.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the small red structure located to the left of the main chalet still present in the transformed scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene appears entirely transformed with a central fantasy creature, and there is no evidence of a separate small red structure which was visible in Image A. The edited image does not depict any standalone structures aside from the creature itself, which dominates the scene.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the waterway flow from the bottom-right corner toward the center-left of the image, maintaining its original course?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waterway indeed appears to flow from the bottom-right toward the center-left of the image, resembling the stream's original course as seen in Image A. Despite the fantastical nature of the scene, the positioning and flow direction of the water remain consistent.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the large patch of snow located directly in front of the chalet still visible and positioned in the same place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not visibly feature the patch of snow located directly in front of the original chalet depicted in Image A. The fantasy transformation scene seems to have replaced natural elements such as snow with more abstract and mystical representations as part of the creature design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are moss-covered rocks visible along the edges of the stream in the transformed scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we can observe moss-covered rocks prominently located along the edges of the stream, similar to how they appear in natural landscapes. Despite the fantastical nature, the elements like rocks and moss are retained around the stream.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the transformed structure located in the mid-ground, slightly to the right of the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature or transformed structure is centralized prominently but leans slightly to the right of the center, similar to where the original chalet was located in Image A. The shift to the right still maintains the visual positioning within the mid-ground of the scene.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the mountain peaks visible in the background, with snow patches and mist covering their upper portions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict mountain peaks with snow patches and mist in the traditional sense. The dramatic fantasy elements replace natural landscape features, though the dark sky may suggest atmospheric elements, but it lacks definitive mountain peaks or snow coverage.",
