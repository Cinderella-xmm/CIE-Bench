    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the ornate bow with symmetrical scrollwork and central fleur-de-lis motif present and accurately rendered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object in question is a small-scale landscape scene within a wooden box, featuring a miniature castle and a river. There is no key depicted in this scene, and thus, the ornate bow with scrollwork and fleur-de-lis motif that would typically characterize an ornate key cannot be assessed in this context.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the distinctive cutout pattern of the key bit, resembling a cross or puzzle piece, preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict the literal presence of a key. Instead, it shows a miniature castle scene in a box. This means there's no distinct key bit pattern such as a cross or puzzle piece present to be assessed.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the segmented fluted ridges along the shaft of the key retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, Image B, there is no appearance of a key whatsoever. Instead, there exists a different scene entirely within a wooden box, therefore, there's no shaft with ridges to evaluate.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the metallic bronze/gold color of the key preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is devoid of any key or key-like object, hence there's no component which displays a metallic bronze or gold color to provide an assessment.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the bow positioned at the top, the shaft extending downward, and the bit at the bottom, maintaining the original vertical alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B doesn't include a key, there is no component to analyze for vertical alignment such as a bow, shaft, or bit.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the vertical wood grain texture present in the background or hill surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main feature is the wooden box holding a miniature landscape scene. The box's interior and exterior may have wood grain, but it's not oriented vertically as described. The background or hill texture is composed of miniature elements, making grain texture not a significant feature.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is a visible shadow cast beneath the key, indicating its three-dimensional form and placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B replaces the key with a three-dimensional miniature landscape within a wooden box, which may have its own elements casting shadows, yet does not involve a key casting a shadow.",
