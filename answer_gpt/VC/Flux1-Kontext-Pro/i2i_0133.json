      "question": "Do both bears retain their round and fluffy body shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear is depicted as a plush toy with a round and fluffy body shape. This is evident from its proportions and soft appearance, which are key characteristics of plush toys designed to be cute and cuddly. The terms 'round' and 'fluffy' describe its overall shape and texture, which align with the design of the stuffed bear.",

      "question": "Are the bears still seated next to each other, maintaining their companionship pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a single plush bear, not two bears as in Image A. The focus is solely on the one bear, making it impossible for the image to illustrate the concept of companionship as seen when two bears sit closely together.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a background with a sky or clouds. Instead, it shows a simple backdrop, likely intended for product display. This is a common choice for images featuring products, as the plain background focuses attention on the item.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no small flowers, daisies, or grass around the bear. The bear is set against a plain backdrop, characteristic of product photography where the emphasis is on the plush toy rather than additional elements like flowers or grass.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush bear clearly has visible paw pads on its feet. This is a design detail often included in plush toys to enhance their cuteness and give them a recognizable bear-like appearance. The paw pads are part of the plush bearâ€™s feet.",
