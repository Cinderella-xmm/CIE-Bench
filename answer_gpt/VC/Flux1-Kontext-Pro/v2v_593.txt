    "Question": "Q1: Does the Funko Pop figure retain the large hind legs characteristic of a kangaroo?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the Funko Pop figure is depicted with a chibi-style representation of a kangaroo. Typically, kangaroos have pronounced, muscular hind legs which are large compared to the rest of their body. The Funko Pop figure does have hind legs that are larger than its front legs, though they are not as exaggerated as a real kangaroo's due to the chibi art style, which often simplifies and exaggerates certain features for cuteness. However, considering the nature of the toy and chibi style, it does reflect the characteristic in a simplified way.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the long tail of the kangaroo preserved in the Funko Pop figure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the Funko Pop figure stands with a noticeable tail, albeit one that is proportionally shorter compared to a real kangaroo's tail. The characteristic of kangaroos having a long, strong tail is stylized here to fit the chibi form factor, which often involves simplified features. Despite being smaller, the presence of the tail in the figure indicates that it has retained this characteristic to some extent.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the chibi-style kangaroo figure inside the box include a pouch?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing the image, the chibi-style figure inside the box in Image B does not visibly display a pouch. Kangaroo pouches are typically not a prominent feature unless intentionally highlighted, which is unnecessary for a toy representation unless for specific detail inclusion. Therefore, it appears not present in this small-scale, stylized adaptation.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the Funko Pop figure primarily colored brown to reflect the original kangaroo?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the Funko Pop figure is predominantly brown, closely resembling the natural coloration of many kangaroo species, including the one depicted as a reference in Image A. In chibi adaptations, maintaining original colors helps in recognition despite exaggerated or minimized features.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the hopping-related elements (hind legs and tail) depicted in the chibi-style figure inside the box?",
    "explanation": "Considering Image B, the chibi-style figure inside the box does exhibit the main elements tied to a kangaroo's hopping ability: the hind legs and a tail, although in a chibi and simplified form. The presence of these features even in a basic or subdued form reflects the figure's adherence to the species' defining characteristics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
