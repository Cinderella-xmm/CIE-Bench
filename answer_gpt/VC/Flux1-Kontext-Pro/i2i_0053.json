      "question": "Are the bananas represented with their characteristic elongated curve and yellow color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bananas are illustrated with an elongated curve and a bright yellow color, which are characteristic features of bananas. This artistic representation captures the recognizable attributes of bananas. Thus, based on these visual attributes, the bananas in Image B are depicted with their typical shape and color.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the banana holder depicted with a curved metal arm supported by a wooden base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an illustration of a holder with a curved arm resembling metal, supporting the bananas. The base looks stylized like wood, with a circular shape. This suggests that the image retains the main features of a banana holder with the curved arm and wooden base design.",

      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the bananas still rest naturally on the curved metal arm?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bananas hanging naturally from the curved metal-like arm of the holder, just as they would in reality. The artistic representation maintains this natural positioning, which makes them appear naturally supported.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image B portrays the bananas as a bunch, connected at the top. This connection is a common visual representation of a bunch of bananas, maintaining the typical way bananas are presented when they are still attached together naturally.",

      "question": "Does the wooden base of the banana holder retain its wood-like texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base is illustrated with a smooth, stylized appearance, typical of an illustration, which lacks the textured details that real wood would have. Unlike the realistic wood texture seen in Image A, the illustrated version loses that texture to simplify the depiction.",
