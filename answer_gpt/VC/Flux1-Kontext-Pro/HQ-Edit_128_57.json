        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a quill that retains the traditional feather shape, which is recognizable by its elongated, tapered form, ostensibly crafted to be both functional for writing and decorative.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book is open, presenting two visible pages. The paper appears aged and yellowed, signifying antiquity or prolonged exposure to environmental conditions.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no evidence of an arched window with a grid of leaded glass panes visible behind the desk. The setting seems to be more simplistic and enclosed compared to what such a window would imply.",

This aligns with elements of Image A, where similar tones are used to convey richness and history, although deep red/blue are not prominently featured in the edited image.",
