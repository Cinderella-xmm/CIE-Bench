      "question": "Are distinct horizontal sedimentary layers visible in the rock face of the cliff?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues of the cliff face show variations in texture and coloration, suggesting the presence of sedimentary layers. Commonly, sedimentary layers in cliffs are formed through geological processes where different materials settle over time, resulting in visible stratification. However, these layers are not distinctly horizontal but rather show variance in orientation and spacing, which makes them less apparent. Thus, the image does not prominently display distinct horizontal sedimentary layers.",

      "question": "Is there a bright, linear reflection of the sun visible on the water surface extending from the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear bright reflection of the sun visible on the water, which extends from the horizon toward the foreground. This phenomenon is commonly seen in nature when sunlight reflects off a water surface, creating a line of bright light known as a sun track. The position and orientation of this reflection align with how the sun's position near the horizon typically creates such a reflection.",

      "question": "Are there multiple small boats visible on the water surface in the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water surface does not display any discernible objects resembling boats. Usually, small boats would be recognizable due to their distinct shapes and colors against the reflective surface of the water, especially if they were visible in groups. The lack of such visual indications in Image B suggests that there are no boats present in the scene.",

      "question": "Are shrubs and small trees growing along the upper edges and crevices of the cliff?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays vegetation, including shrubs and small trees, growing along the edges and crevices of the cliff. This growth pattern is typical in rocky areas where plants can find purchase in cracks and lower spaces, offering protection and access to water. The image shows signs of greenery along the cliff face, indicating the presence of such plants.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are large, irregular boulders and grassy patches present in the foreground near the cliff edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains visual cues in the foreground showing large, irregularly shaped boulders and areas where grass is growing. These elements are common in natural cliff environments where the terrain is uneven and vegetation can thrive in patches protected from harsh elements. The visible arrangement and spacing of rocks and grass indicate their presence close to the cliff edge.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the sun located low on the horizon, emitting a warm golden glow across the sky and water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sun is shown relatively low on the horizon, casting warm golden hues across the sky and reflecting on the water. This lighting condition is typical during sunrise or sunset when the sun is near the horizon, causing the sky and surroundings to be illuminated in golden tones. The scene captured in Image B reflects this atmospheric effect.",

      "question": "Does the cliff edge form a steep, continuous drop-off directly into the water below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cliff edge that is steep and descends into an area below, though not necessarily forming a continuous drop-off directly into the water. There is rock and vegetation visible further down, which suggests that while the cliff has steep portions, it may not continuously drop straight into the water without any intermediating layers or terrain.",
