    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes positioned symmetrically within the face, with a slight upward slant at the outer edges and gazing directly forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on visual cues in Image B, the key facial features, including the eyes, are not discernible due to the blur applied to the face area. Therefore, it's impossible to determine the positioning or expression of the eyes. Without seeing Image A for comparison or any other reference, the position or angle of the eyes in Image B cannot be evaluated.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the nose have a straight bridge and a slightly rounded tip, aligned centrally between the eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Without the ability to observe detailed features such as the nose due to the blurring of the facial area in Image B, it's impossible to describe any characteristics of the nose or assess its alignment between the eyes. Hence, the nose cannot be analyzed in this context.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the lips thin, closed, and slightly upturned at the corners, forming a neutral yet thoughtful expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurring of the face in Image B eliminates the possibility of perceiving or accurately describing the lips, their shape, or any expression they might convey. Therefore, any analysis regarding the lips or expression is not feasible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the face proportionally balanced, with equal spacing between the eyes and symmetrical distribution of facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the blurring applied in Image B, it's not possible to identify or evaluate the proportions or symmetry of facial features. The analysis of facial balance necessitates visible structure, which is absent in the image provided.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the left ear partially visible, emerging from under the hair near the temple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the left ear typically emerges from the hair near the temple, Image B’s blurring impedes the visibility of features such as the ears. Thus, the left ear’s visibility or position in relation to the hair cannot be confirmed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there soft shadows along the right side of the face and under the jawline, created by directional lighting from the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The presence of soft shadows usually indicates specific lighting conditions; however, due to the blurred facial area in Image B, any analysis regarding shadows or their directional nature cannot be made. Lighting effects and shadows are visually obscured.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the head centered above the shoulders, with no unnatural tilt or rotation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The head, depicted in Image B, seems centrally positioned with respect to the shoulders, as suggested by the alignment of the body and attire in the image. Despite the facial blur, other visual cues such as clothing and posture provide some insight into the head’s position.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
