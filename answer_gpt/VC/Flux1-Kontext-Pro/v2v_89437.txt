    "Question": "Q1: Is the ALSC logo present in the bottom right corner with the blue \"ALSC\" text, the integrated black checkmark, and the full name \"AUTHENTICATION LEGALIZATION SERVICES CANADA\" in black capital letters below it?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a logo present in the bottom right corner that resembles a typical corporate logo style. It has large blue text spelling 'ALSC' with a prominent integrated checkmark in black that overlaps with the letters. Below this is the text 'AUTHENTICATION LEGALIZATION SERVICES CANADA' written in black capital letters, which matches the typical format of a company's full name label. Based on this description, the features of the ALSC logo are present as described.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are there exactly five orange circular markers positioned along the black checkmark pathway, each containing a white icon?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the black checkmark pathway only has four orange circular markers, each containing different white icons. The number of orange circles determines whether there are five, and based on observation, there are not exactly five, but four. Therefore, the condition of having exactly five orange circles is not met.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the icon in the first orange circle (bottom-left) a white magnifying glass over a document?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the first orange circle at the bottom left contains a white icon that appears to be a document with a corner folded, not a magnifying glass. A magnifying glass is typically a circular lens with a handle, which is not present in this icon. Therefore, the white icon in the circle does not include a magnifying glass.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the text next to the first orange circle \"We verify your Document\"?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no text available next to any of the orange circles. The image primarily consists of icons and design elements without any accompanying text near the circles. Therefore, there is no text \"We verify your Document\" present next to the first orange circle or anywhere in the image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there five blue dots placed along the black checkmark pathway, one between each pair of adjacent orange circles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the black checkmark pathway between the orange circles lacks the blue dots. The black pathway instead weaves through red ribbons, which means there are no blue dots present between the orange circles. Therefore, the statement that there are five blue dots is not correct.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the title \"ALSC 5 Easy Steps\" displayed at the top in bold blue font, with the subtitle \"For documents to be used in Qatar\" directly below it in smaller blue font?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the title \"ALSC 5 Easy Steps\" is indeed present at the top in a bold, blue font. However, the subtitle \"For documents to be used in Qatar\" in smaller blue font is missing entirely. Without the subtitle, the full specification in the question is only partially met.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the background of the image plain white with no patterns, textures, or colors?",
    "explanation": "Observing Image B, the background appears to be plain white without any additional patterns, textures, or colored areas. The image contains orange icons, a black checkmark, and red ribbons, but the overall background remains unaffected and white. Therefore, the statement about the background being plain white is accurate.",
    "answer": "Yes"
