        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, every figure is seen holding a golden object. The left figure holds a golden orb, the central figure holds a golden object, and the right figure holds a golden box. The presence of these items is a distinguishing characteristic across all three figures.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figureâ€™s hands are clasped over their chest, signifying a different posture from the others. The two other figures hold their gifts with both hands, clearly indicating a differing way of holding the objects between the central and side figures.",

    {

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure is indeed smaller in stature compared to the figures on either side, who are taller. The central figure is kneeling instead of standing with hands clasped. This discrepancy highlights a difference from standing figures and indicates a different stature position.",
