      "question": "Does the boot retain the same shape and arrangement of the elongated oval cutouts on the side panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boot features elongated oval cutouts on the side panels that appear to be in the same shape and arrangement as in Image A. These cutouts are consistently spaced and similarly styled, which suggests that the design has been retained accurately. Comparing this detail from Image A to Image B, both images show these features without variation, indicating that this aspect was preserved during editing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the eyelets positioned in the same vertical alignment and spacing as in the original boot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyelets in Image B are positioned in a vertical alignment that appears consistent with Image A. Each eyelet follows a similar spacing and alignment pattern as observed in the original, confirming the accuracy in their positioning.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the outsole retain the exact tread pattern and groove depth as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the tread pattern on the outsole does not match exactly with the pattern in Image A. While both feature a rugged design indicative of hiking boots, the specific arrangement and depth of grooves seem altered. This deduction comes from detailed observation of the tread's intricate layout and groove depth, suggesting they don't precisely match.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the toe cap present and shaped identically to the original, including its rounded front and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toe cap is present and exhibits a rounded front similar to Image A. The positioning and general shape appear to be identical in both images, indicating accurate preservation of this feature. This is determined by comparing the curvature of the toe cap and where it is positioned relative to the rest of the boot.",

      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the padded collar at the top of the boot preserved in shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The padded collar in Image B shows retention of shape and position as seen in Image A. Both images display a robust, consistent padding at the top of the boot, maintaining the structural aspect typical for providing comfort and support. This is deduced from observing the collar's thickness, contour, and its relationship to the boot's overall shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the boot positioned in the same side profile with the same forward tilt as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the boot in a side profile view with a slight forward tilt which seems to mirror Image A's positioning. This is confirmed by noting how both boots appear in relation to a consistent orientation angle and side perspective, suggesting that they share the same visual presentation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the tongue of the boot visible and shaped similarly to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tongue of the boot is visible and appears similarly shaped as seen in Image A. Both images show the tongue emerging from the laces in a recognizable contour, suggesting consistency has been maintained. Comparing its visibility and shape from both images confirms that this aspect is intact.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The heel counter in Image B shows a design element that is consistent with Image A in terms of presence and shape. Both images reveal a robust heel structure that contributes to the boot's supportive properties, indicating that this has been preserved accurately. This conclusion arises from examining the contour and reinforcement clearly depicted in both images.",
