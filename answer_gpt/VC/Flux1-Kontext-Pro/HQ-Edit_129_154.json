      "question": "Are the floral and foliate engraved patterns visible on the body of the transformed owl, arranged symmetrically between vertical ribs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanical owl features detailed engravings of floral and possibly foliate patterns throughout its body, but they are not specifically arranged between vertical ribs. The owl's body seems to have a more intricate and integrated design, unlike the original teapot's structured vertical rib arrangement. Therefore, the arrangement is not symmetrical between vertical ribs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the transformed owl retain a shiny, polished metallic surface consistent with the original teapot’s finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanical owl does have a shiny, polished metallic surface. This is consistent with the metallic finish of the original teapot in Image A, which also appears reflective and polished. Both items share similar metallic surface qualities.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the beak of the mechanical owl shaped like the original teapot’s curved spout, extending forward and slightly upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl has a distinct beak, but its shape is more in line with a bird's natural beak rather than the curved spout design of the original teapot in Image A. The spout of the teapot extends forward and slightly upward in a unique way that doesn't match the owl's more typical beak structure.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the tail of the mechanical owl follow the same graceful C-shaped curve as the original teapot’s handle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanical owl does not visibly display its tail following the same C-shaped curve as the teapot's handle from Image A. The owl's tail is either not shown or integrated into its body design without adhering to the specific curvature of the teapot handle.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the crown-like head of the mechanical owl include a pointed, tiered finial matching the original teapot’s lid top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl's head features a crown-like design with a pointed and tiered finial, resembling the tiered pointed decoration of the teapot's lid in Image A. The visual similarity indicates that this element has been carried over into the owl design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the body segments of the mechanical owl divided into vertical ribs, each housing a decorative motif, mirroring the original teapot’s structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl's body design does not clearly show vertical ribs housing decorative motifs in a manner that mirrors the original teapot in Image A. The owl has a more cohesive pattern and design across its body rather than distinct vertical rib sections as seen in the teapot.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the ornamental scrollwork present at the base of the mechanical owl’s tail, corresponding to the original handle’s end?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the mechanical owl's tail does not prominently feature ornamentation resembling scrollwork that directly corresponds to the original teapot’s handle end in Image A. The detail work does not primarily focus on scrollwork at the tail's base.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the tail of the mechanical owl rendered in a dark brown tone consistent with the original handle’s color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanical owl's body, along with any visible tail-like protrusion, is primarily metallic, akin to its overall structure. The original teapot handle in Image A has a distinguishable dark brown color, which is inconsistent with the metallic tones of the owl.",
