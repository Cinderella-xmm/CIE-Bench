      "question": "Is there at least one clock face with Roman numerals visible on the front or side of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe a complex structure that resembles a clock. By focusing on the clock face visible in the front, we notice traditional clock hand elements but no Roman numerals, suggesting instead a detailed design more consistent with vintage machinery or decorative style. Therefore, based on this observation, the answer is 'No'.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there transparent glass panels on the lower section of the clock showing internal mechanical components such as pendulums and weights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower section of the structure incorporates transparent glass panels that visibly display internal components reminiscent of mechanical workings, including pendulums and weights, typically seen in mechanical clock structures. This observation leads us to conclude 'Yes'.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the base of the structure contain decorative relief carvings featuring circular medallions and floral motifs arranged symmetrically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, careful observation of the base reveals decorative carvings. These carvings include elements such as circular medallions and similar motifs that are symmetrically arranged as part of the ornate design. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a sharpened wooden pencil standing vertically to the right of the clock, with its graphite tip pointing upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on the clock structure without the presence of additional objects such as a pencil. Specifically, there is no image of a sharpened wooden pencil. Therefore, the conclusion is 'No'.",

      "question": "Is the background composed of a light-colored surface with a visible grid pattern of evenly spaced horizontal and vertical lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a light-colored surface similar to Image A, yet it possesses a slight texture resembling shadow or aging paper without distinct grid patterns. This suggests that the visible surface in the background does not feature a conspicuous grid. Consequently, the answer is 'No'.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a structure that, despite its intricate and fantastical elements such as claws and pipes, maintains a form that generally fits the description of being tall, rectangular, and multi-tiered with columns and an ornate top. Given these recognizable architectural features, the answer is 'Yes'.",
