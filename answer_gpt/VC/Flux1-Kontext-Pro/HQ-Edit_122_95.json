    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there two female figures present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is only one female figure depicted in the artwork. She is seen wearing a saree, positioned centrally in the frame. The presence of one figure can be inferred from the singular depiction of the character with no duplicate or secondary figure visible.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the two figures positioned symmetrically relative to the central axis of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since there is only one figure in Image B, the question of symmetry between multiple figures does not apply. The scene consists of a singular female character, making symmetrical positioning of two figures impossible.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure in the background is reminiscent of the Taj Mahal, which features a large central dome. The presence of this typical architectural feature at the end of the pathway is evident from the depiction of domes in the artwork.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an enclosed architectural element resembling an entrance or frame around the central structure, similar to a grand archway or doorway typical in Mughal architecture.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a straight water channel running from the foreground to the central structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a scene that includes decorative elements like a pathway but lacks an actual water channel, which is often a key feature found in front of the Taj Mahal in reality.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the sarees retain a dominant red and gold color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is adorned with earrings, but there is no indication of a forehead ornament or a second figure to display any jewelry.",

      "question": "Do both figures have long, dark hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The singular female figure in Image B is depicted with long, dark hair. As there is no second figure, the question does not apply to multiple individuals.",
