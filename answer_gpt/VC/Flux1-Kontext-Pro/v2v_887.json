      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a cartoon character dressed as a young chef with a white chef hat and apron. The character holds a pizza cutter and a floppy pizza with melted cheese and toppings. There is no part of the costume that resembles a golden-brown crust with charred edges like those of a pizza. Crust elements are typically found on the pizza itself, not within the character's costume in this context.",

      "question": "Are there visible raised bubbles and browned patches on the cheese-like elements of the character’s costume?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character’s costume and accessories, such as the apron and the hat, are designed separately from the pizza she holds. The pizza itself has a cheese-like texture with browned patches, but the character’s costume does not include these cheese-like elements as part of its design. Traditional chef uniforms typically lack texture similar to cheese.",

      "question": "Does the character’s body or head silhouette retain a triangular shape reminiscent of a pizza slice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B is depicted as a typical anime-style cartoon chef, with a round face and a standard body silhouette. There is no triangular shape in the design of the character's body or head that would remind the viewer of a pizza slice. The triangular shape is usually associated with pizza slices, but not with the character's design here.",

      "question": "Are the dominant colors of the character’s costume primarily golden-orange and yellow, matching the original pizza’s hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is wearing a white chef hat and a yellow apron, while the pizza she holds has colors like red (tomato) and yellow (cheese), but the dominant costume colors are white and yellow. Although not a perfect match, the yellow apron slightly resembles the color of melted cheese. However, the overall outfit is not primarily golden-orange.",

      "question": "Do the cheese-like parts of the character’s costume show a textured surface with small raised bumps or ridges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character's costume in Image B does not have any elements that show a textured surface similar to cheese. The design features smooth surfaces typical of a chef’s uniform. The pizza, not part of the costume, has such textures, but these elements are not in the attire worn by the character.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is designed as a chef, holding a whole pizza. The character itself is neither represented as a pizza slice nor designed in such a manner. The design does not incorporate elements that visually resemble a single pizza slice.",
