      "question": "Is the clock face still white after the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face is a circular component displaying the time. Observing its color, it remains white, just as in the original Image A. Based on my knowledge of typical wall clocks, white clock faces are common for minimalist designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both the hour and minute hands still black after the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon examining the clock hands, the hour and minute hands are black. This observation aligns with typical clock design where these hands often contrast with the clock face for visibility. Comparing with Image A, where they were also black, confirms no change in color.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there still a red second hand on the clock after the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the second hand is observed to be a thin, red line, which is a common color choice for second hands to distinguish them from the hour and minute hands. Image A also shows a red second hand, indicating no change after the edit.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the orange pivot point still present after the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The orange pivot point in Image B is where the three clock hands intersect, continuing to show a small, round, orange-colored feature. This matches the design observed in Image A, where the pivot point was also orange, confirming consistency across the images.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Does the clock face remain free of numbers or markings after the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face is blank, devoid of any numbers or index markers, reflecting a minimalist design. This is the same as Image A, which also lacked any numerals or markings, confirming that the edit did not alter this aspect.",
