      "question": "Is the bust oriented in a side profile facing to the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bust is oriented with a partial side profile facing towards the right. This is evident by the position of the bust and the direction it is turned, featuring the right side of the bust more prominently than the left. This orientation is a typical feature of classical busts. Image A similarly has the bust facing to the right, indicating the orientation has not been altered.",

      "question": "Is there an inscribed plaque on the base with the word \"APOLLO\" visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an inscribed plaque on the base of the bust with the word 'APOLLO' visible. This can be identified by the shape and positioning of a rectangular plaque at the front of the pedestal, a design typical for busts that state the subject's identity. Image A also shows the same plaque with the ‘APOLLO’ inscription, indicating consistency between the two images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the neck, shoulders, and chest appear anatomically consistent with classical sculptural forms. The neck is notably elongated, and the shoulders are broad, aligning with traditional representations of figures from antiquity. In Image A, the same proportional characteristics are evident, signifying that there has been no alteration in these elements.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts drapery that extends from the left shoulder across the chest in a diagonal fold. This style of draping is a conventional approach in classical sculpture to mimic the ancient clothing worn by important historical figures. Upon evaluating Image A, the drapery is similarly arranged, indicating no alterations in the drapery's positioning have been made.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the bust is a cylindrical pedestal with a flat top where the bust rests and a rounded bottom, typical of a classical sculpture design which provides stability and aesthetic appeal. A comparison with Image A reveals the same cylindrical pedestal design, confirming that the base design remains unchanged.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a small circular medallion or button-like ornament is visible on the left shoulder of the drapery. Such details are commonly found in sculptures to add visual interest and serve symbolic purposes. Image A also shows this feature, indicating that it is a consistent element in both images.",
