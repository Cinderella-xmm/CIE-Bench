        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is not on a clock but instead on a cat sitting on a couch with glasses and a remote control. There is no clock or any structure displaying the text 'REVERE BEACH'. Based solely on Image B, there are no visual cues to suggest the presence of any clock-related text like 'REVERE BEACH'.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a domestic scene with a cat and does not feature any clock with numerical markings. There are no Roman numerals visible in this image based on its content. The focus remains on the cat's accessories such as glasses and a collar, not on any time-telling device.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks any clock or post structure entirely. The primary subject is a seated cat with a television remote, so there are no indications of a tall, ornate metal post or anything resembling a mount for a clock. The scene is mostly contained within an indoor setting.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is composed of an indoor setting with a cat watching television, and does not include any scenes of an ocean or a sky backdrop. There are no environmental features consistent with an outdoor setting depicting natural elements like the ocean or sky.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no clock represented, and thus, no clock face that is oriented in any direction. The main focus is on a cat situated in a domestic living room environment, devoid of any items resembling a clock or that can face a viewer.",
