      "question": "Is the blue herringbone-textured jacket retained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoonish owl character wears a blue jacket, but there is no visible herringbone texture. The texture seen in Image A, which has detailed fabric patterns, is absent in the hand-drawn style of Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A shows a clear collar and lapel design typical of a formal jacket. In Image B, the owl's jacket does have a collar and lapel, resembling the general style but not identical in shape due to the simplified, cartoonish representation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A shows two microphones in front of the speaker. In Image B, there is no representation of microphones, as it is a cartoon drawing focusing on an owl character, with no podium or microphones depicted.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the speaker's right hand is visible and raised with an open palm. In Image B, the owl’s right 'hand' or wing is raised and open, mimicking a similar gesture. Despite the stylistic difference, the basic gesture is retained.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
