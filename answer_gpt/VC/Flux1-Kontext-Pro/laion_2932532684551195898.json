      "question": "Is the white base of the face paint present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The white base of face paint typically covers large areas of the face for dramatic effect. Image B shows only blurred regions where such paint might be, making it impossible to identify any white face paint. Based on visual cues from Image B alone, we cannot confirm the presence of a white base of face paint.",

      "question": "Are the black stitched lines around the mouth and cheeks present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Black stitched lines are distinct markers usually visible around facial features like the mouth and cheeks, often for dramatic or artistic effect. Since Image B's relevant facial region is blurred, these features cannot be visually confirmed. Therefore, in Image B, such details are not visible by inspection.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Red floral designs are typically vibrant and would stand out around the eyes. However, Image B has these regions blurred, making it impossible to identify any specific red floral designs. Based on Image B alone, these designs cannot be seen.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Purple eyeshadow and long false lashes are cosmetic features that would be distinctly visible if present around the eyes. Image B has blurry regions in these areas, making such specific cosmetic details impossible to identify visually.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A blue spiderweb pattern with golden dots would be a distinctive mark on the forehead, typically serving artistic or thematic purposes. The forehead area in Image B is blurred, and therefore, these patterns can't be confirmed visually.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows clear visual cues of large, vibrant orange and yellow fabric flowers in the headdress, which are typical elements of decorative or festive attire. These colors and shapes are distinctly recognizable and help confirm their presence.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The braided hairstyle with intertwining colors, such as black, orange, and yellow, forms a visual pattern that is apparent in Image B. These colors and braiding technique are visibly distinguishable in the hair, evoking themes of cultural or festive attire.",

      "question": "Do the earrings retain the golden filigree pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible part of the earrings shows a different design resembling a character-shaped ornament rather than filigree detail. Therefore, based on the visible cues in Image B, the filigree pattern is not present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays green leaves intertwined among the flowers in the headdress. The presence of colorful flowers and associated green leaves is consistent with thematic decoration and is visually verifiable.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Pink blush, when applied, would enhance the warmth and color of the cheeks. Image B, however, has blurred regions in facial areas where blush would typically be applied, making it impossible to verify its presence.",
