      "question": "Is the helmet equipped with two curved horns and a central white feather-like adornment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the helmet features two distinct and prominent curved horns positioned symmetrically on either side. However, there is no visible white feather-like adornment in the central part of the helmet, which suggests that the helmet design is missing this element. The analysis is based on the visual cues showing the helmet structure and decoration.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character holding a round shield with a visible central boss, and the rivets can be identified upon close inspection. This design is consistent with traditional shields used for protection in medieval times, emphasizing durability and functionality.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual examination does not reveal any sword sheathed at the character's back, nor is there a visible hilt. The character's back is occupied by the shield and other armor elements, indicating the absence of a sword carried this way.",
