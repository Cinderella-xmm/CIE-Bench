      "question": "Is there a large, circular, reddish celestial body located in the upper left portion of the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a large, circular reddish shape resembling a celestial body, positioned towards the upper middle part of the image, not strictly the upper left. This round shape corresponds to the stylized representation of a moon. Considering the artistic style as resembling a celestial body, the presence suits the description of being large and reddish.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a stylized embroidery of a mountain range with distinctive peaks that appear to be snow-covered, as depicted using lighter colored threads contrasting with darker sections indicating rock formations.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a large, central depiction of swirling water patterns styled as a lake or river in an embroidery form, with varying shades of blue stitching. The arrangement and placement indicate its importance as a central feature. Although the nature of reflection is stylized, the depiction aligns with the description of a central water body.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a pattern of red-colored elements interpreted as vegetation along the shoreline on both sides of the depicted river or lake. These red-colored features are stylized as trees and are distinct in their positioning along the embankments, resonating with the description of lining clusters.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B uses artistic stitching patterns to represent water, which traditionally symbolizes reflection, there is no explicit representation of reflections of the red moon or mountains in the water within this stylized artwork. The depiction is more abstract without direct reflective visuals.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes visual elements along the edges of the stylized water body that resemble rocks, shown through different colored and textured stitching. However, there are no clear representations of snow patches, only these embroidery-textured rock-like visuals that hint at terrain.",
