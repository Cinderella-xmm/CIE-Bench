    "Question": "Q1: Is the barbell rod visibly present and gripped by both hands across the lifter's upper back?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lifter is depicted gripping a barbell with both hands. However, the barbell is positioned in front of the lifter's thighs, suggesting a deadlift position rather than being rested across the upper back as in a squat lift. This erroneous inference of the barbell's location stems from the clarity of Image B, where the lifter's grip on the bar in front is apparent. Given these observations, the barbell is not on the lifter's upper back.",
