    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the model’s original facial features, including dark eyes, defined cheekbones, and full lips?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, facial features appear stylized in entirely gold tones and geometric patterns, in line with an art deco design, which do not allow for the observation of specific characteristic features such as dark eyes, defined cheekbones, or full lips. This reflects a deliberate transformation for an artistic representation rather than preserving original facial details.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the model’s long, straight black hair parted down the middle still present in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hair is styled into a short, wavy bob typical of the 1920s flapper style, in contrast to the long, straight black hair parted down the middle seen in Image A, suggesting a change to match the art deco theme.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the wide silver crystal choker necklace still visible around the model’s neck?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not clearly depict a wide silver choker necklace as in Image A. Instead, the style is consistent with the golden geometric art deco motif covering the model, which lacks a distinctively silver choker element.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the model maintain the same upright stance with hands clasped at the waist and legs slightly apart?",

    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are both hands positioned together at the waist, holding the bag handle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the model's hands are not clasped together at the waist holding a bag handle; instead, one arm is bent at the elbow with a hand on the hip, aligning with traditional art deco imagery.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the model’s natural skin tone and body proportions preserved in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a gold-toned stylized art deco design, which alters natural skin tones into a monochromatic gold palette with emphasized geometric patterns, yet the overall body proportions align with the characteristics of the style, providing an artistic transformation.",
