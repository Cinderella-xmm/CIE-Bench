      "question": "Is the fan-shaped headdress with radiating elements present on the warrior’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object on the warrior's head is distinctly fan-shaped with elements that radiate outward, characteristic of a traditional warrior headdress. The design is intricate and follows the pattern expected of such a headpiece, where radiating lines are typical. Based on these visual cues and common interpretations of helmeted figures, the headdress fits the description.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a circular emblem located at the center of the chest plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a prominent circular emblem positioned centrally on the warrior's chest. This emblem is clearly defined and fits within the typical motif of warrior armor, often used to denote rank or affiliation. The distinct circular shape confirms the presence of such a feature.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is a spear held in the warrior’s right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right hand of the warrior is holding an object that resembles a traditional weapon. However, this object does not exhibit the elongated, pointed structure typical of a spear. Instead, it appears closer to an alternative type of weapon. Therefore, a spear is not present in the warrior’s right hand.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the torso and legs covered in layered, scale-like armor pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The warrior in Image B is adorned in armor that has a scale-like appearance, characterized by overlapping plates that mimic the texture and arrangement traditionally recognized as scale armor. The detail of these layers is apparent on both the torso and legs, aligning with the historical context of such design elements.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the statue placed on a white pedestal with two visible plaques at the front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue stands on a white pedestal, but there is no clear indication of any plaques present on the front of this pedestal. The base appears stark and minimalist without additional features such as plaques. This suggests the absence of the specific detail of two plaques.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are framed landscape artworks visible on both side walls of the gallery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the statue in a room where the surrounding walls are plain and devoid of any ornamentation or artworks. There are no framed landscape artworks visible on the walls, indicating a blank canvas environment typical of a minimalist gallery space.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the statue centered in the gallery space with equal spacing to the side walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue's positioning within the room appears centered, but the environment itself lacks spatial context given the absence of visible structural features or adjacent walls. Therefore, the exact amount of central alignment concerning side walls cannot be conclusively determined from the image alone.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left hand of the warrior holds an object that visually resembles a shield in both shape and position, typical of an armament piece held for defensive purposes. The style and proportion suggest it is indeed a shield, consistent with historical warrior iconography.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face of the warrior in Image B is deliberately obscured, making it impossible to assess facial features such as the nose, eyes, or mouth. Therefore, there can be no conclusion about these specific attributes based on the available details.",
