      "question": "Is the Swoosh logo present in the same curved shape and located on the lateral side of the midsole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close examination of Image B, there is no visible shoe or Swoosh logo in the image. The visual is entirely black, suggesting the shoe and its elements, including the Swoosh logo, are no longer visible. Therefore, evaluating its shape and location is infeasible. Based on this analysis in Image B, the answer is 'No'. In comparison, Image A clearly displays a shoe with the Swoosh logo in the lateral position on the midsole.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a horizontal strap positioned across the midfoot area of the shoe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lack of any discernible object due to the blackout of the image indicates that there is no visible horizontal strap across the midfoot area of the shoe. Therefore, the answer is 'No'. In comparison, Image A shows a shoe featuring a strap across the midfoot area.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a pull tab located at the top rear of the heel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not permit visual inspection due to its entirely black content. Thus, it is impossible to confirm the presence of a pull tab at the heelâ€™s top rear. Based on this unavailability of visual information, the answer is 'No'. By contrast, Image A visually shows a pull tab in the specified location on the shoe.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the shoe shown in a lateral (side) profile view?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks visible information to verify the shoe's orientation as it presents a completely black image. Hence, the lateral profile view cannot be confirmed. Therefore, the answer is 'No'. In Image A, the shoe is indeed shown in lateral profile view.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the shoe maintain the same overall silhouette, including the rounded toe box, thick midsole, and elevated heel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not provide any visual detail, thereby obscuring the silhouette examination of the shoe. Consequently, the visual characteristics such as the rounded toe box, thick midsole, and elevated heel cannot be affirmed. Hence, the answer is 'No'. Compared to Image A, which clearly displays these silhouette features.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the sneaker still the central and primary object in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B is completely black with no visible objects, it indicates that nothing appears as the central or primary object. Thus, the sneaker cannot be identified as such in this context, resulting in the answer 'No'. Contrasted with Image A, which unmistakably positions the sneaker as the focal object.",
