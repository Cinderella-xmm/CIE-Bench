    "Question": "Q1: Is the central character (derived from the green block) positioned exactly in the middle of the composition, surrounded by other characters?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are two characters holding a green block in the center of the composition. However, the green block itself is not a character. The characters are based on the red blocks, one of which has a face and body, indicating only one character design shown. The characters do not appear to be exactly in the middle, nor are they surrounded by other characters, only block shapes in the background.",
    "answer": "No"
},
{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the characters derived from the blocks retain the circular stud pattern on their upper surfaces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character with a red block for a head retains the circular stud pattern on the upper surface. This is visible on the character's red block face, which has the same stud pattern as the original red blocks in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
},
{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the characters derived from the blocks primarily composed of rectangular or boxy shapes, preserving the original block geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character on the left has a head shaped like a rectangular block with the same stud pattern, indicating the preservation of the original block geometry. The character's body is not boxy but appears to be designed to look like a human figure, deviating slightly from the boxy shape. Thus, partially preserves the block geometry.",
    "answer": "No"
},
{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the composition filled with a dense cluster of characters (originally blocks), arranged in a piled, overlapping manner?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the composition is not filled with a dense cluster of characters. Instead, there are only two prominent figures, one red and one holding a green block. The composition has a pink background with scattered hearts, not showing a piled or overlapping manner. This differs greatly from Image A, where the blocks are densely clustered and overlapping.",
    "answer": "No"
},
{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there only one character (derived from the green block) that differs in color or design from the surrounding characters?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a green block being held by a character, but the block itself has not been turned into a character. Both figures in the image are designed around red and pink colors. Therefore, no character derived from the green block stands out distinctly in color or design from others because such a character does not exist.",
    "answer": "No"
},
{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the characters derived from the blocks retain any visual indication of interlocking mechanisms (such as recessed areas or connectors)?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character with the red block head does not exhibit any recessed areas or interlocking mechanisms, aside from the visible stud-like pattern. However, the block design itself (with studs at the top) doesn't show interlocking mechanisms such as recessed areas or connectors commonly found in traditional interlocking blocks, as these details are not visible.",
    "answer": "No"
