      "question": "Is the crocodile's snout with two visible teeth present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited illustration of the crocodile, the snout is visible with stylized detail typical of comic art, including lines and shading that suggest texture. However, the two visible teeth shown in Image A are not distinctly outlined or present in Image B. This could be due to the cartoonish, simplified artistic style of Image B.",

      "question": "Is the colorful knitted hat with a red pom-pom still present on the crocodile's head in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a stylized illustration of the crocodile, and its hat is vividly rendered with multiple bright colors, similar to a knitted texture, and includes a red pom-pom. This corresponds to the colorful knitted hat with a red pom-pom seen on the crocodile's head in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crocodile is depicted with bright orange-framed sunglasses covering its eyes, consistent with the style and placement of the sunglasses in Image A. The sunglasses maintain their orange color but appear more stylized to suit the illustration's aesthetic.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crocodile's head is depicted facing forward with a slight leftward turn, similar to its orientation in Image A. This posture is achieved through the position of the snout and eyes in the cartoon style of the illustration.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background doesn't depict natural water but rather a stylized, colorful surface. It gives the impression of a graphic representation instead of a realistic setting. Image A shows the crocodile in actual water, but this element is abstracted in Image B.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunglasses exhibit a shaded area to represent reflected surfaces, stylized in line with the illustration's art style. However, there are no distinct reflections or realistic reflections visible as seen in Image A, which showed reflections in the lenses.",
