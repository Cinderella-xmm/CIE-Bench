      "question": "Is the fish depicted in a continuous, coiled circular posture with its head pointing toward the upper right and tail curving beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fish sculpture is depicted in a continuous circular coil, which is evident from the curve of its body and the positioning of its head and tail. The head is facing towards the upper right and the tail curves beneath it, completing the circular posture. The visual cues in the image clearly indicate this positioning and the coherence of the posture of the fish.",

      "question": "Are there three distinct barbels extending from the lower jaw of the fish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fish sculpture's head is detailed enough to observe specific features like barbels. However, there are three circular marks that suggest decorative elements rather than barbels, as they do not resemble traditional fish barbels which usually extend visibly from the jaw. World knowledge about fish anatomy would indicate that barbels typically protrude clearly and are easy to identify, which is not the case here.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the dorsal fin located along the upper back of the fish and shaped with a serrated edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fish sculpture features fins that are placed along its back, with a noticeable serrated edge. The dorsal fin's typical location in fish anatomy is along the back, and the sculptural details suggest this fin with a distinctive serrated appearance which aligns with such location and shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the scales arranged in overlapping rows along the body of the fish, running from head to tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the sculptural depiction of the fish in Image B, the body exhibits detailed texturing that resembles scales arranged in overlapping rows, typical of fish anatomy. These scales are observed running throughout the body from head to tail, a common pattern in fish species to facilitate movement. This sculptural detailing aligns with real-world understanding of fish scale patterns.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the tail of the fish curve underneath the body and connect near the head, completing a nearly full circle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the fish's tail curving in a manner that brings it close to the head, thereby forming a nearly complete circular arrangement. The tail curves beneath the body and wraps around to the head, indicating this completed circular formation which visually conveys this posture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there two pectoral fins visible on the side of the fish, one near the head and one further back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B depicts the fish with distinct fins, including pectoral fins. However, only one pectoral fin is prominently visible near the head, and there does not appear to be another pectoral fin further back visible. Typically, pectoral fins are located near the head, and this sculpture aligns with that realistic feature in terms of one fin's visibility.",

      "question": "Is the fish carving contained within a square-shaped panel with rounded corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the sculpture is freestanding and lacks any enclosing panel. The fish sculpture is displayed on a pedestal with no visible square panel or rounded corners, differing from an inset appearance on a panel format. The composition indicates a standalone sculpture rather than a panel-based carving.",
