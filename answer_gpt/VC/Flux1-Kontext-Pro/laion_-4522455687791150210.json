      "question": "Is the lime green body of the saree adorned with small golden diamond-shaped butis evenly distributed across the fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a statue with a saree draped in a marble-like material, making the detection of colors and small details challenging. Within the context of this statue, the saree does not show any identifiable patterns or coloration that resemble the lime green and golden butis noted in the original image due to the monochrome appearance of the material.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the pallu feature a blue and gold striped pattern with repeating elephant motifs in gold zari?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The saree in Image B, being crafted from a marble-like texture, does not visibly exhibit any colors or detailed patterns such as stripes or elephant motifs due to the uniform material. The lack of blue and gold hues coupled with the absence of intricate motif detailing makes the answer evident.",
      "weight": 3,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given Image B's monochrome marble-like statue representation, the blouse does not display any coloration like royal blue or any form of embroidery along the neckline and sleeve edges. The sculpture doesn’t convey any color differentiation for the attire.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the necklace is sculpted without color, exhibiting a plain design due to the marble texture. There are no visible details or color contrast indicating red and green stones as seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Are there earrings matching the necklace visible in both ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue's ears don’t display any sculpted ornamentation, including earrings. The monochromatic nature of the statue’s material obscures any possibility of matching earrings that parallel the necklace.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an unadorned wrist of the statue without any visible bangles or jewelry. Due to the uniform marble-like appearance, any bright or golden accessory typical in Image A’s context is absent.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, there is no visible bindi on the forehead of the statue. The marble-like quality makes such small and colorful ornamentation unattainable.",
