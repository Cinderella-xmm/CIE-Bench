    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the vertical facial split between black and white fur still present, dividing the face precisely down the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a portion of a figure's head where the visible part of the fur is dark, and the other part seems to lead into the blurred region, implying a change in fur color. The possibility of a central split remains, despite the lack of clarity beyond the blurred region, based on common markings seen in similar figures or representations.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both eyes large, round, and positioned symmetrically on either side of the facial split, with visible highlights reflecting light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes are obscured by the blur in Image B. Therefore, based on the visible parts and typical design traits from similar figures, we can infer continuity in features, but cannot visually confirm their symmetry and highlights in reflection on this specific image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the dog in an upright sitting position with both front paws flat on the ground and hind legs tucked beneath the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure's visible body shows both front paws flat on the ground and a position commonly associated with a sitting posture where hind legs are typically beneath. This aligns with the characteristics of an upright sitting position typical for such toys or figures.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both ears pointed upward, erect, and symmetrical, with visible pink inner surfaces and dark outer edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visible parts of both ears in Image B show them as upward and erect. The inner surface of each ear exhibits a pinkish tone, and their outer edges are darker, consistent on both visible ears, suggesting a symmetrical configuration typical to such designs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the black nose centered on the white muzzle, with visible whisker lines extending from the sides of the snout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure's partial view shows the lower muzzle area with a circular element which likely represents a tag, but without a complete view of the nose region itself and absence of visible whisker lines.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a collar visible around the dogâ€™s neck with at least one tag hanging from it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Clearly visible on the edited image is a collar with what appears to be a tag suspended from it, which is consistent with the description of tags typically appearing on such figure models.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
