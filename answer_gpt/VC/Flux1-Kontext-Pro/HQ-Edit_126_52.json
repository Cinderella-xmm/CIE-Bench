    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the cactus still spherical in overall shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus retains a rounded, spherical shape similar to Image A. The overall contours are round, which is characteristic of a spherical form. By observing both images independently, we can conclude that the spherical nature of the cactus is consistent.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the vertical ribs of the cactus clearly visible and maintaining their segmented pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vertical ribs of the cactus are distinctly visible, and they show a segmented pattern just like typical cacti. This segmentation is evident through the distinct separations on the cactus surface, similar to Image A, thus confirming the visibility and pattern of the ribs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the main body of the cactus still predominantly green in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The main body of the cactus in Image B is visibly green, which is the predominant color for cacti. This matches with Image A, where the cactus is also primarily green. Despite added elements in Image B, the primary coloration remains unchanged.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the cactus positioned vertically and resting on a flat surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus is vertically oriented, sitting in a pot, which appears to be placed stably on a flat ground in the desert landscape. This indicates that the positioning is vertical and typical as found in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a textured, flat surface beneath the cactus container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cactus sitting on a pot which is directly placed on a desert ground rather than a wooden textured surface like in Image A. The surface in the desert is not depicted as textured, hence it lacks the distinct flat texture seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the cactus placed directly above a supporting structure (such as a pedestal or pot)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows that the cactus is contained within a pot, which acts as its supporting structure. This is consistent with Image A, where the cactus is also supported by a pot, confirming the placement above a supporting structure.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the light source coming from the upper left, casting shadows toward the lower right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunlight is depicted coming from the upper left, which is evident from the direction of the light beams and shadows. The shadows on the cactus and the pot cast toward the lower right, which is consistent with the lighting direction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
