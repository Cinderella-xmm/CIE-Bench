      "question": "Is the elephant’s head with large, flared ears and visible eye clearly present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant’s head is prominently featured as part of the teapot design, with clearly visible large, flared ears and a detailed, visible eye. This design element is consistent across both images, but specifically, in Image B, it is encased in a glass dome. The large ears and eye are defining features that are clear and distinguished in the design.",

      "question": "Is the trunk of the elephant clearly formed into the spout of the teapot, extending upward and backward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot, designed as an elephant, clearly integrates the elephant’s trunk into the teapot's spout. The trunk is well-defined, extending from the face, curving upwards, which is a typical design for such artistic teapots, ensuring practical functionality while maintaining the aesthetic of an elephant's trunk.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elephant-teapot in Image B is designed with four distinct limbs akin to an elephant's legs, forming the base that supports the body. This is visible within the glass dome, and the legs are detailed with engravings, replicating an elephant’s natural stance.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the teapot design featuring a domed lid on top, completing the upper structure of this elaborate piece. The pointed finial at the top is clearly part of the lid, adding a decorative yet functional component to the teapot, which is typical in such intricately designed items.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body of the teapot in Image B is adorned with ornate engravings, including flowers resembling lotuses and vines that wrap around and embellish the surface. These patterns contribute to its elegant appearance and are distinctly visible, indicating careful craftsmanship aimed to enhance the art piece.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot appears to have a darker, more bronze-like finish compared to a silver metallic one. The lighting and rendering give it a more antiquated and subdued look rather than a bright, reflective silver. The metallic finish does have some sheen, but it's not predominantly silver.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there is a cup present next to the teapot, it does not appear prominently silver or paired with a saucer in the arrangement. The setup is displayed within a glass dome, alongside natural elements, which might obscure its similarity to the brighter metallic finish potentially found in Image A.",
