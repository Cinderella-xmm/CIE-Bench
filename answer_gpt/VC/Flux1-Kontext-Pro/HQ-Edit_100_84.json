      "question": "Are there exactly three triangular sails attached to the dhow, arranged in a staggered vertical line?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dhow features one large visible sail that is prominently displayed, without any obvious staggered arrangement. The artistic style simplifies the details, especially in comparison to realistic portrayals such as Image A, which depicts three distinct triangular sails in a staggered, diagonally ascending vertical line. Thus, Image B's representation does not match the description of having exactly three triangular sails staggered vertically.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dhow have a wooden hull with visible arched windows and decorative lattice railings along the upper deck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a dhow that is artistically illustrated with a wooden hull, visible arched windows, and what appear to be decorative elements along its structure. The style is ornate, albeit in a stylized manner, suggesting decorative lattice work. This matches the description of having a wooden hull with arched windows and decorative elements resembling lattice railings.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the dhow oriented diagonally across the frame, with its bow pointing toward the upper right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dhow is oriented with its bow directed toward the left, not the upper right. This is a distinct opposite orientation compared to the description of the dhow positioned diagonally with the bow pointing to the upper right. This contrasts with Image A, where the dhow does indeed point towards the upper right within its frame.",

      "question": "Are there multiple small sailboats visible on the horizon in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are more sailboats depicted in the background, similar to Image A. The cover design shows at least one additional smaller sailboat on the horizon, which is consistent with the description of having multiple small sailboats visible.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sun located low on the left side of the image, casting a bright golden reflection across the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sun appears to be positioned off the compositions, with the sky brightened to suggest sunrise or sunset. However, it is not depicted with a direct golden reflection typical of the other image. This contrasts with Image A, where the sun is indeed located on the left, casting a bright golden light across the water.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a visible wake and reflection of the dhow beneath its hull on the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration style of Image B does not explicitly show details such as a wake or reflection beneath the dhow. The water is artistically rendered, but lacks detailed wakes and reflections as seen in Image A, where a wake is visibly created by the dhow sailing through the water.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the dhow have a long, pointed bow extending forward from the hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dhow features a long, elegant bow that extends forward, reflecting a traditional dhow design. The illustrative nature still maintains the essence of a pointed bow, similar to design elements that allow vessels to cut through water efficiently. Therefore, it matches the description of having a long, pointed bow.",
