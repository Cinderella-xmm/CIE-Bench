    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the large tree trunk with textured bark positioned on the left side of the image, partially obscuring the rear wheel of the bicycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a large tree trunk is indeed present on the left side. However, unlike Image A where the textured bark partially obscures the rear wheel, in Image B the tree trunk does not have textured bark and the bicycle is placed more away from the tree trunk, not obscuring the rear wheel at all.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the bicycle make direct contact with the tree trunk, leaning against it on its left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycle is depicted standing independently without making direct contact with the tree trunk. The tree trunk is nearby but the bicycle is not leaning against it, unlike Image A where it appears to be resting against the tree.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a continuous road stretching from the foreground into the background, aligned horizontally across the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the path is visible, but it is not horizontal like a traditional road. Instead, it's a winding, curving path that moves through the scenery. Unlike Image A, which has a clearly defined road stretching horizontally, Image Bâ€™s path meanders through the landscape.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there exactly three motorcyclists riding in a straight line along the road in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two figures on motorbikes rather than three, and due to the artistic style, they are not riding in a straight line. Image A shows three motorcyclists in a straight line, clearly different from Image B.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the bicycle located on the left side of the image, with the road and motorcyclists positioned to the right and extending into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycle is indeed located on the left side, but the road is more of a curved path with the motorcyclists on it, not extending directly to the right as it does in an organized manner in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the rear wheel of the bicycle partially obscured by the tree trunk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rear wheel of the bicycle is clearly visible and not obscured by the tree trunk. This contrasts with Image A, where the tree trunk partially conceals the rear wheel.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a round headlight mounted on the front fork of the bicycle, consistent with Image A. The depiction remains clear in both images.",
