    "Question": "Q2: Is the zebra still in its original standing posture facing slightly towards the right?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is depicted in a stance with its body mostly parallel to the frame and its head turned towards the camera, slightly facing the right as per the viewer's perspective. This aligns with a typical natural posture one might expect in such an image, combining both visual cues from the position of the legs and head direction.",
