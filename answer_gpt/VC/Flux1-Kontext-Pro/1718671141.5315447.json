        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building appears to be situated on a platform that raises it slightly above the ground level, evidenced by the steps leading up to the structure. This indicates that the building is not directly on the ground but on an elevated base.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the building is on a raised platform, it is centrally located in front of the still water surface, clearly above it. This central positioning above the water pool is distinguishing.",
