      "question": "Does the image retain the gesture of both women shaking hands over the tennis net?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues indicate that both women are extending their arms over the tennis net, engaged in a handshake. The position of their arms and hands, along with their body orientation toward each other, supports the notion of a handshake gesture, which is a common greeting or sign of sportsmanship. This action is clearly depicted in the edited image.",

      "question": "Are both women holding tennis rackets in their hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, one of the women is clearly holding a tennis racket, identifiable by its typical ovular shape and strings. The other woman, although not explicitly shown holding a racket in the edited image as the focus seems to have changed slightly, is implied to have a racket by her side which was originally present in Image A. Therefore, considering typical tennis match scene settings, it's reasonable to assume both are holding tennis rackets.",

      "question": "Is the tennis court depicted with green surfaces and white boundary lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The court in Image B shows surfaces that are visually similar to the traditional green hue seen in tennis courts. The boundaries on the court are marked with lines that are lighter in color, consistent with white boundary lines used in sports courts to denote inbounds and out-of-bounds areas.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible tennis ball illustrated on the court itself or near the ground. The edit seems to exclude such detail, focusing more on the players and their handshake. Without visible tennis balls on the surface in the imagery, it is conclusive that there isn't one present in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a tennis net is prominently depicted, dividing the court between the two women. It is vertically aligned and extends across the width of the court. The presence of this net is further emphasized by the handshake occurring over it.",
