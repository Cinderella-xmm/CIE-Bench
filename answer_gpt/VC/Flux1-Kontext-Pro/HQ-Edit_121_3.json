    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the central flower beneath the butterfly a pink coneflower with a prominent spiky central cone and drooping pink petals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central flower beneath the butterfly does not resemble a traditional pink coneflower with a spiky central cone and drooping pink petals. Instead, it is a uniquely stylized flower where the petals themselves mimic the patterns and colors of a butterfly's wings. This flower does not have the characteristic coneflower shape or texture. By comparing to Image A, where the central flower is indeed a pink coneflower, the distinction is clear.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the butterfly positioned directly above the central cone of the flower, with its body aligned vertically over it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the flower petals closely mimic the butterfly's wings, and its body is centered perfectly over the flower's central region, creating an integrated and seamless look. In comparison, Image A also shows the butterfly positioned above the central cone but not in an aligned or fused manner. Image B's artistic representation is more about mimicry and blending.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there tall golden grasses and additional pink coneflowers visible in the background behind the main flower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background contains several golden grass-like elements and additional flowers that resemble pink coneflowers, contributing to a visually rich meadow setting. Image A has similarly textured grasses and floral elements, affirming the continuity in both images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sky a pale blue with soft white clouds and a warm golden light illuminating the meadow from below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a pale blue sky with subtle white cloud formations. The warm golden light effect is apparent, casting a glow on the meadow scene. This description aligns closely with the common depiction of a serene and idyllic meadow under soft lighting, comparable with Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small clusters of purple wildflowers and pink spiky blooms visible among the grasses in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background has a variety of wildflowers, including purple blooms and other pink spiky flowers that add depth to the setting. These visual elements can be seen among the grasses, contributing to the meadow’s richness. This range of flora is consistent with Image A's integration of similar flower types.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the central cone of the flower have a spiky, bristly texture made of densely packed dark-tipped florets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central portion of the flower doesn’t exhibit a spiky, bristly texture or densely packed, dark-tipped florets as one would expect from a conventional coneflower. Instead, the focus is on the continuity between the flower and butterfly, creating a seamless visual attraction.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the petals of the central flower curve downward and have a smooth, elongated shape with a soft pink hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the petals do not curve downward nor present the traditional smooth, elongated shape with a soft pink hue of coneflower petals. Instead, they extend outward mimicking butterfly wings in color and pattern, different from the soft pink, drooping coneflower petals observed in Image A.",
