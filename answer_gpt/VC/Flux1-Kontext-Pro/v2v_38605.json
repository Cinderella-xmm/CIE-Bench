      "question": "Does the edited image retain the dynamic posture of the subject, showing a forward-leaning stance with bent knees?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject maintains a posture typically associated with skiing, featuring a forward-leaning stance and bent knees. The dynamic movement is visible through the interaction with water, similar to snow, suggesting the subject is maintaining similar skiing posture on a different terrain.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the subject holding ski poles, which is inconsistent with surfing. In surfing, the hands are usually free or interacting with the surfboard. Therefore, the subject's hand posture and equipment do not suggest typical surfing interaction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The attire in Image B remains consistent with cold-weather skiing gear, including a jacket and gloves, rather than adapting to the beach setting with a wetsuit or lighter beach-appropriate attire.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject retains a skiing helmet, which can be seen as protective gear, but is not specifically adapted for surfing, as surfing protective gear typically includes wetsuit materials and features specific for water sports.",
