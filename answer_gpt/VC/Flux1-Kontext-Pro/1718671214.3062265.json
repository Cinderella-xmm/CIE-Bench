    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the metallic mask with horn-like protrusions at the temples present and retaining its original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cartoonish version of the subject with decorative elements in the hair, but there is no sign of a metallic mask with horn-like protrusions. The artistic style shift in Image B results in a more stylized and abstract representation, making the presence of the original metallic mask unlikely.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red lips and visible lower face (including chin and jawline) clearly present and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower face details including lips, chin, and jawline are obscured or simplified due to the cartoon style and creative interpretation. Therefore, these features don't appear as they might in Image A, suggesting changes in representation.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the black hair styled in an updo with floral branches positioned symmetrically on both sides of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the hair in a similar updo style as seen typically in cultures with floral decorations. The symmetrically positioned floral branches remain on both sides of the head, consistent with the original style shown in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are cherry blossom branches visibly integrated into the hair on both sides of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B maintains the artistic feature of cherry blossom branches integrated into the hair on both sides, reflective of traditional hairstyles, and consistent with the styling insights gathered from Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the subjectâ€™s facial skin tone fair and uniformly lit, matching the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration-style alters the lighting and shading, making the skin tone cartoonish and possibly deviating from realism observed in Image A. The use of flat colors in Image B differs from any realistic lighting and skin tone present previously.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the subject facing directly forward with a symmetrical pose and centered composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images depict the subject facing forward in a centered composition. The symmetry in Image B's artistic style reflects the centered and balanced pose present in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the mask retain a textured, metallic surface appearance rather than becoming smooth or cartoonish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show a presence of a mask with a textured metallic surface. Given the cartoon style of Image B, any such feature would tend to appear smooth and illustrative rather than textured or metallic.",
