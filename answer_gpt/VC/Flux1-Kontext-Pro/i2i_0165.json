      "question": "Does the refrigerator retain its clear glass shelves with the same arrangement as the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the refrigerator features multiple clear glass shelves, each holding various food items. The structure and alignment of these shelves appear consistent with how refrigerators are typically designed, consisting of several equally spaced transparent shelves.

Thus, the refrigerator in Image B does retain its clear glass shelves with the same arrangement as in the original image.",

      "question": "Are the specific food items (like fruits, bottles, and jars) present in their original positions within the refrigerator?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows various food items placed in specific locations on the shelves. Jars, fruits like grapefruits and lemons, bottles, and condiments are stationed at certain spots, typical for kitchen fridge arrangements. In Image A, observing the same section reveals the identical positioning and assortment of food items as Image B. As there's no noticeable shift in position or types of items, their original positions appear preserved.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a countertop that holds a fruit bowl and a plant placed to the left of the refrigerator. This setup, typical for a kitchen arrangement, allows for easy access to items on the counter next to the refrigerator. Comparing with Image A, the same elements - a countertop with a fruit bowl and a plant - are located adjacently, suggesting the positioning remains unchanged between the two images.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kitchen background is characterized by light-hued walls, sleek cabinetry, tiled backsplashes, and a window providing natural light, typical of modern kitchen designs.

      "question": "Apart from the specified logo replacement and custom label, are there no additional alterations to the appearance of the refrigerator?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, aside from observing the custom label stated to replace the original logo, there are no visual indicators of further modifications to the refrigerator's appearance. The overall look, including its structure and color, seems consistent with that of Image A. Closely analyzing both images confirms no additional physical or aesthetic changes other than the noted logo adjustment, maintaining the refrigeratorâ€™s original appearance otherwise.",
