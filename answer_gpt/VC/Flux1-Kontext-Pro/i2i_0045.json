      "question": "Is the girl’s posture and act of holding the frisbee accurately represented in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no girl or frisbee depicted. The main subject is a double-decker bus parked on a platform with a no entry sign beside it. Since the question assumes the presence of a girl holding a frisbee, which is not visible in the image, the posture and act of holding the frisbee cannot be assessed.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the stone platform retain its original shape and location under the girl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a stone platform visible under the bus, suggesting that an object is placed on it. However, as previously mentioned, there is no girl present in the image. Without a direct comparison involving a girl standing on a platform, one can't assess any changes related to her presence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the frisbee’s shape and color preserved in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any identifiable frisbee object. Therefore, there is no basis to assess the preservation of a frisbee's shape and color. Since the presence of a frisbee is necessary for making such a judgment, and it is absent, the shape and color cannot be evaluated.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Has the girl’s summer outfit been retained in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since there is no girl depicted in Image B, the question of preserving her summer outfit is irrelevant. Without a visual reference to any person, the presence or details of an outfit cannot be assessed.",

      "question": "Does the new grass and sky background integrate seamlessly with the girl, platform, and frisbee without disrupting their appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a double-decker bus set against a rural backdrop with grass and sky. The integration or appearance of a girl, platform, and frisbee cannot be evaluated because there is no indication of these elements in the image. Therefore, any disruption associated with them cannot be determined.",
