      "question": "Is the background a solid turquoise color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears as one consistent, unvarying shade, which can be described as turquoise, a combination of blue and green hues with more blue.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dominant color on the subject is a uniform gold hue, resembling a metallic gold statue.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's pose is distinct with their body positioned at an angle, leaning slightly forward with their right arm extending forward in a reaching or expressive gesture, and their left leg poised behind—the typical characteristics of a dynamically diagonal stance, suggesting motion or an expressive pose.",

      "question": "Are there decorative elements attached to the boots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boots are styled seamlessly with the gold plating, implying a uniform appearance without additional decorative features such as flowers or embellishments. The boots have a smooth texture and design without any adornments attached to them.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silhouette of the boots in Image B shows a clearly defined heel structure, elevated, indicating the presence of high heels typical to certain fashion boots. The heel's extension from the sole suggests a significant height.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject in Image B appears coated in a gold finish with no discernible accessories like bracelets on the wrists. Everything is stylized as a single flow of material that resembles a statue with no distinct embellishments.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the subject have long black hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hair appears to have the same metallic gold hue as the rest of the figure, heavily stylized in line with the statue aesthetic, differentiating from a natural black. The visual cues provide a consistent gold representation rather than a distinct hair color which would contrast this uniform appearance.",
