      "question": "Does the robot retain its dome-shaped head with three evenly spaced circular porthole eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's head is observed to be dome-shaped, and there are three circular porthole-like structures visible. This characteristic aligns with typical design elements seen in various mechanical and robotic designs emphasizing a symmetrical and practical configuration. The porthole structures are evenly spaced around the dome, as is often implemented for aesthetic or functional purposes, such as providing a wide field of vision in three directions. Comparing with common robot designs, this arrangement is logical and plausible.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the transparent chest panel still present, clearly displaying the internal gear system?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chest panel of the robot appears to be transparent, allowing the internal gear system to be seen. This transparency fits within typical design trends for showcasing mechanical intricacies and focusing on the technological aesthetic of robots. Displaying the interlocking gears visibly emphasizes the mechanical aspect of the robot.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do both arms retain their segmented, piston-style joint construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot’s arms are visible and constructed with segmented joints that resemble piston mechanisms. Such design elements are familiar in robotic engineering, enabling flexible and realistic articulation and movement of parts. This segmentation typically mirrors the requirements for functional yet durable construction in robotics.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both feet equipped with exactly five claw-like toes each?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, each foot of the robot appears to be fitted with claw-like toes. Counting and visual inspection indicate that each foot has five toes, a design choice that can contribute to a balance between stability and aesthetic allure in fictional robotic designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there five distinct spires and antennae on top of the robot’s head, including one central and four lateral ones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining the head of the robot in Image B reveals several spire and antennae-like extensions. These features serve practical functions such as communication or sensory capabilities in many robot designs. However, upon counting, it appears that there might not be exactly five spires, indicating a modification in the head's design details.",

      "question": "Are multiple interlocking gears of different sizes visible through the transparent chest panel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transparent chest reveals a mechanism where several interlocking gears can be seen. Different sizes and intricate placements of these gears are apparent. Such arrangements are typical in machines where gears are featured prominently to signify mechanical complexity and function.",

      "question": "Does the robot maintain its original oxidized bronze and copper color scheme with visible wear and aging effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the robot with a color scheme dominated by bronze and copper hues. The surface of the robot shows signs of oxidation, consistent with exposure-related wear and aging, offering a vintage, steampunk-like appearance which is classic in many artistic and visual representations of robots.",
