      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the SUV appears intact but is depicted on a wooden platform, which is different from being directly on the beach sand as commonly seen in real-world settings. The structural integrity remains intact, as there are no visible damages to the vehicle itself.",

This suggests that their clothing styles have been retained during the editing process.",
