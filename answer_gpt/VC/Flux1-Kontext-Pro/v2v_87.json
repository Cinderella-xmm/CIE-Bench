      "question": "Does the elephant in the edited image retain large, fan-shaped ears that extend outward from the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the elephant is displayed within a glass case labeled 'African Elephant.' The ears are large, fan-shaped, and clearly extend outward from the head. This visual cue combined with the label strongly indicates that the elephant retains the characteristic large ears typical of African elephants.",

    {

      "question": "Are the elephant’s tusks long, curved, and off-white in color, extending downward from the upper jaw?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's tusks are visible, protruding from the upper jaw and extending downward. They are long, curved, and have an off-white color, consistent with the natural appearance of elephant tusks, particularly in African elephants.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the elephant’s skin depicted with deep wrinkles and folds, particularly on the trunk, legs, and ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, Image B, the elephant's skin is depicted with extensive detailing, showing deep wrinkles and folds on the trunk, legs, and ears. This representation is realistic and consistent with the characteristic skin texture of elephants.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant’s feet are not depicted with five distinct toes. Elephant feet typically do not show distinct toes in images as their toes are covered by a thick layer of skin and nails, and only some are visible. The visual representation in the edited image does not detail five individual toes on each foot.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, both depict a backpack in a rich, saturated red color. There is no visible difference in the color saturation between the two images, indicating that the edited image retains the same red hue as the original.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backpack is clearly placed as a separate object within the glass display alongside the elephant, maintaining its position near the elephant. This indicates that it is a distinct entity within the composition.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the features visible in Image B, such as the large, fan-shaped ears extending outward, the long and curved tusks, and the robust body structure, the animal can be identified as an African elephant. Additionally, the display label directly specifies 'African Elephant,' affirming this identification.",
