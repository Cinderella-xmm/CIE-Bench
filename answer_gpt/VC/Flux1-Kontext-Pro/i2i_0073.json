        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the frame around the mirror appears to maintain a gold-like hue. The consistency of this color, along with its shiny appearance typical of metal frames, suggests that the gold framing is still present based on the visual cues of metallic brightness and color. Therefore, using common sense about typical mirror frame materials and appearances, we can conclude that the mirror in Image B retains its gold frame.",
