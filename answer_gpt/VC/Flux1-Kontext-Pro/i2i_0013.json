      "question": "Does the edited image retain Einstein’s disheveled white hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair appears gray and matches with the iconic image of Albert Einstein's hair, which is known for being disheveled and iconic in style. This indicates that the edited image retains this characteristic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the edited image show Einstein with his tongue out?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible parts do not depict Einstein's tongue out, as this specific gesture is usually more focused on the facial expression, which is obscured by the blur.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image maintain Einstein’s face shape and proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given that Image B appears to be a caricature-like or keychain representation, it is likely stylized, and thus may not accurately maintain Einstein's real-life face shape and proportions due to the nature of caricature designs which tend to exaggerate or simplify for appeal.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a suggestion of clothing. The neck area appears to have a triangular blue shape which may represent clothing, such as a tie or part of a suit. Such an indication aligns with the traditional portrayal of Einstein wearing professional attire.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {

      "question": "Does the edited image convey Einstein's playful demeanor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "As Image B is a stylized image and with the limited information available due to the blur and style, whether it conveys Einstein's playful demeanor is largely subjective. Caricatures often aim to capture the essence of a figure, yet since specific facial features are obscured, it is harder to definitively conclude that playfulness is conveyed.",
