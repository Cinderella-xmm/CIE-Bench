      "question": "Does the giraffe retain its characteristic brown polygonal spots on a cream-colored base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffe has clearly visible polygonal, brown spots distributed across its body. These spots are characteristic of a giraffe’s pattern, typically seen in the real world. The base of the giraffe is a cream color, which is a common depiction of giraffe skin. Combining this visual information with knowledge of giraffes’ typical coloring leads to this conclusion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the two small, rounded ossicones present on top of the giraffe’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffe has two noticeable structures on the top of its head which resemble ossicones — the bony projections seen on real giraffes. These are small and rounded, matching the typical anatomy of giraffe ossicones. The visual appearance of these structures combined with common knowledge about giraffe anatomy informs this analysis.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the giraffe have dark eyes and a slightly upturned mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffe’s eyes are dark, which aligns with typical giraffe illustrations and toys. Its mouth also appears to be slightly upturned—a common feature used in plush toy designs to give a friendly expression. The combination of observing the eye color and mouth shape, along with knowledge of typical toy design, supports this conclusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the giraffe standing upright in the center of the room?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the giraffe in a packaging form, not standing upright in a room environment. Instead, it is positioned alongside other toys, as part of a product presentation. This contrasts with the notion of being inside an actual room, emphasizing that it is not standing in the center of a room environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the giraffe covered in a soft, fuzzy plush texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffe looks like it's made of a material that would be soft and fuzzy, consistent with a plush toy's common texture. This conclusion is drawn from both the appearance of the giraffe in the context of a plush toy display and the visual softness indicated by the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the giraffe’s ears have a rounded shape and are they positioned symmetrically on either side of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The giraffe in Image B displays ears that are rounded and symmetrically placed on the sides of its head. This matches the typical feature placement seen in both real giraffes and their toy representations. The symmetry and ear shape are clear in the visual context.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the giraffe’s legs end in dark-colored hooves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The giraffe's legs in Image B culminate in darker ends compared to the rest of its legs, which resemble hooves seen in real giraffes. This observation reflects the typical structure of giraffe legs, where hooves are indeed the darker, terminal points.",
