      "question": "Is the red roof of the house located on the left side of the peninsula still visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a large dragon-like creature with bat wings prominently visible on the lake in the foreground. In Image A, a house with a red roof is positioned on the left side of the peninsula. The red-roofed house is not visible in Image B as the creature distracts from the previous elements seen on the land.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the long black building situated near the center-right of the peninsula still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a large dragon-like creature with bat wings on the water. The peninsula and its features, including the black building that was visible in Image A, are obscured by the creature. Consequently, the black building is no longer visible.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the golden-brown grasslands covering the peninsula still visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's main feature is the large creature in the middle of a body of water, which takes central focus and results in the peninsula and its grasslands being obscured or transformed. Thus, the golden-brown grasslands are not visible in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a large creature is standing on water without visible patches of ice on the lake's surface, whereas in Image A, such ice patches are clearly visible. Thus, in Image B, the ice patches do not appear.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows mountains with snow-covered peaks and visible streaks of snow running down the slopes, much like in Image A, where the snow patterns are quite distinct. The streaks still appear in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A shows the red-roofed house positioned to the left of the black barn. However, Image B focuses on the large creature and does not display the red-roofed house or the black barn. Hence, the positions of these buildings cannot be observed in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on a fantastical creature in the lake, with the background showing elements of the blue sky and white snow on the mountains' peaks. However, the red roof and the brown grass from Image A are not visible. Thus, the image does not fully retain the original color scheme.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main focus is the creature on the lake, overshadowing the visibility of the winding shape of the peninsula that is visible in Image A. The peninsula's distinctive curve cannot be discerned in Image B.",
