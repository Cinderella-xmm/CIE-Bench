      "question": "Is the cat's fur predominantly white?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) depicts a cartoon-style image with bold colors and high contrast, making specific analysis of fur color challenging. However, the areas intended to represent the cat's fur are primarily filled with a bright color, likely suggesting white due to the strong contrast with the background colors. Therefore, the fur can still be considered predominantly white.",

      "question": "Is the cat sitting upright on the sand with front paws forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is drawn in a simplified cartoon form but maintains the same posture as in Image A. It appears to be sitting on the sand, with legs positioned as if the front paws are forward, consistent with a typical sitting posture.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a hot dog in a bun with a zigzag of mustard on top, placed in front of the cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, in front of the cat, there is an object depicted with a shape similar to a hot dog in a bun, with a clear line representing mustard zigzagging on top. Despite the artistic representation, the basic composition of a hot dog with mustard is clear.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a harness-like depiction around the cat's neck and chest area. However, due to the artistic style, specific details like a buckle or pouch are abstracted but implied through the darker shades, mimicking the real harness's layout and shading.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sunglasses positioned over the cat's eyes, covering the upper part of the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the cartoon image (Image B), the sunglasses can be identified as large shapes over what seems to be the upper part of the cat's face area, just as in Image A, suggesting that the sunglasses are positioned correctly over the eyes.",
      "weight": 2,

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the comic portrayal in Image B, whisker lines are not easily discernible due to the art style and the blocking area. However, referencing the common design elements of cartoon animals, the presence of whiskers is a typical feature and likely implied.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
