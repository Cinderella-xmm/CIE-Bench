      "question": "Is there a white blaze running down the center of the horse's face from the forehead to the muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the edited image (Image B), the horse depicted as a plush toy does exhibit a distinct white blaze that runs down the center of its face, stretching from the forehead to the muzzle. This visual element is clear and consistent with realistic representations of horses that commonly have such markings. Thus, the presence of the white blaze is evident from the visual cues.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the horse have a large white patch on its left side, extending from the shoulder toward the flank?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the horse, represented as a plush toy, indeed has a large white patch on its left side that begins around the shoulder area and stretches towards the flank. This detail is recognizable by looking at the color contrasts on the toy, similar to piebald or skewbald patterns seen in real horses.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the horse facing slightly to the left of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plush horse in Image B is designed to face directly towards the viewer, showing a frontal view with no tilt to the left side of the frame. The position of the eyes and the body orientation serve as key indicators, leading to the conclusion that the horse is not facing slightly to the left.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there multiple dandelion seed heads visible in the foreground, surrounding the horse’s legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the setting contains multiple small daisies rather than dandelions, and these are interspersed around the legs of the horse plush toy. These flowers do not resemble the larger, round seed heads typical of dandelions, which clarifies the floral depiction.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a forest of tall coniferous trees visible in the background behind the horse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features trees that are part of a manufactured or illustrated backdrop rather than a real setting. These trees appear to be deciduous or stylized, rather than the specific, pointed shapes of tall coniferous trees, which informs the analysis.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the sunlight coming from the left side of the image, casting a golden glow on the horse’s mane and left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B appears even and artificial, typical of indoor settings or controlled environments where plush toys might be displayed. There is no evidence of sunlight, such as a golden glow, indicating a specific natural light source direction, such as from the left.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the horse standing directly within the field of dandelions, with flower stalks reaching up to its legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush horse is positioned on a manufactured patch of ground with small daisies and grass represented around it, rather than a field of dandelions. This depiction clarifies that actual dandelions and corresponding stalks are not present in the manner described.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are both ears of the horse upright and pointing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both ears of the plush horse toy are indeed crafted to be upright and point forward. This alignment is typical of many toy representations intended to reflect poised and attentive expressions commonly exhibited by real horses.",
