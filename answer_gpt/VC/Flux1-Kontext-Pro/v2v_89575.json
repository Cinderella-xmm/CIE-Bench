      "question": "Is the infinity pool's edge still visible and defining the boundary between the water and the surrounding landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting is different from an infinity pool. Instead, it depicts an ancient stone relief pool where the edge is visibly defined by the stone structure. The pool’s boundary is clear, but its relation to an infinity pool is not applicable here. Analyzing the setting as a historical or artistic design with stone and relief engravings suggests that the pool’s edge serves a defined structural purpose rather than blending into the landscape.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the woman still positioned centrally in the pool, maintaining her original orientation relative to the pool's edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman depicted in the stone relief is not a real person but part of the stone design, possibly representing a historical or artistic motif. She is positioned slightly off-center as part of the artistic layout of the relief. The analysis of the stone relief indicates intentional placement within the context of ancient or artistic settings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the traditional-style buildings with tiered roofs still visible in the background, integrated into the stone relief design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a stone relief that primarily consists of carved figures and patterns typical in historical or architectural themes. There is no visual indication of traditional-style buildings or tiered roofs visible in Image B, suggesting an entirely different setting focused on the stone relief itself.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the dense tropical foliage, including palm trees, still present in the background, albeit reimagined as part of the stone relief?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B features a stone relief devoid of any tropical elements such as foliage or palm trees. Instead, it presents a structured stone wall with intricate carvings that are typical of historical architecture but not representative of natural landscape features.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the scene retain a bright and clear lighting effect, consistent with the original sunny day atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B appears bright, likely due to direct natural light, indicating a clear day. The stone relief is uniformly illuminated, which corresponds with a sunny atmosphere akin to outdoor settings.",
