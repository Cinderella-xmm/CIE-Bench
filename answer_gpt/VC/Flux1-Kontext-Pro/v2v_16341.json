      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child is shown with a slight bend in the knees and arms slightly outstretched, which is indicative of a playful stance common among children when splashing water. The visual cue of water being kicked up around the child's feet reinforces this idea. Combining these observations with typical child behavior around puddles, it can be assumed that the child is playfully interacting with the water.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two adults holding each other with their arms around one another in a manner that suggests close physical intimacy and possible dancing. Their positioning, with one person slightly lifted off the ground, and their embrace, strongly indicates dancing. When comparing with Image A, both scenarios depict similar body language associated with dancing couples, affirming that they continue this action.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the older man is positioned in the background, and despite the bright surroundings, he holds a cane with the same posture as seen in Image A. This suggests continuity in his action and static position across both images, reflecting his walking aid or resting stance with the cane.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the woman holding an umbrella, held above her head, with her positioned close to the child. The umbrella signals an intention to shield from inclement weather, despite the sunnier environment depicted in the edited image, and her proximity to the child suggests a protective posture, similar to her original stance observed in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues needed to assess facial expressions are not available due to the blurring of faces in Image B. Therefore, based only on what can be inferred from body language and positioning, it remains impossible to accurately assess or compare facial expressions from Image A.",
