      "question": "Is the detailed texture of the elephant's skin, showing wrinkles and creases, preserved in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's skin shows detailed texture with visible wrinkles and creases. This indicates that texture detailing is well preserved, much like the natural wrinkled appearance of an elephant's skin. The image seems to exhibit a high level of detail typical to the skin surface of elephants, suggesting careful attention to texture.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the elephant's posture, including the raised front leg and curved trunk, retained in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the posture of the elephant with a raised front leg and a trunk that appears naturally curved downward. The animal's pose, suggesting movement or a relaxed state, is well captured and consistent with natural elephant behavior, indicating that the posture has been preserved.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the elephant's ears and trunk, consistent with its young age, maintained in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the elephant's ears and trunk appear large relative to its body size, which is characteristic of juvenile elephants. These features are critical for indicating the young age of the elephant and are well represented in the image. Thus, the proportions are consistent with a young elephant.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the elephant positioned on the rock edge, with its legs and trunk maintaining their relative placement to the rock surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant gives the impression of standing on a flat surface with its legs placed solidly beneath it. Although the environment is a cleaner, more neutral backdrop without clear indications of a rock edge, the posture and relative placement hint that the positioning relative to the ground surface is maintained.",
      "weight": 2,

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the elephant face towards the right side of the image, preserving its profile orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the elephant facing towards the right side, showing a clear side profile with its head, ears, and trunk oriented in that direction. This maintains the animal's orientation from the original pose, preserving the profile view.",
