      "question": "Does the soccer ball retain exactly 12 black pentagonal panels and 20 white hexagonal panels arranged in a spherical configuration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the analysis of the soccer ball shows that it is illustrated in a halftone style with the characteristic black and white pattern. While the small black pentagonal and larger white hexagonal panels are evident, the style may not make it clear whether there are exactly 12 and 20 of each due to the artistic rendition. However, the traditional arrangement is implied visually. Without counting each panel due to artistic convention, a specific number confirmation isn't ascertainable solely from Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the soccer ball depicted as a three-dimensional sphere with curved surfaces and proper perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artistic, halftone illustration style flattens the soccer ball slightly, despite attempts to showcase depth using shading and patterning. The illusion of a three-dimensional sphere and proper perspective is partially maintained, but the artistic style causes it to appear less naturally curved compared to a realistic depiction such as in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the goalpost maintain a rectangular frame with two vertical posts and one horizontal crossbar forming a standard goal shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the goalpost's structure retains the recognizable rectangular frame consisting of two vertical posts with a horizontal crossbar, typical of a standard soccer goal. This is evident through the silhouette and line work of the goalpost even in the stylized format.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the net of the goalpost composed of a visible grid pattern of intersecting lines forming square or rectangular cells?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the net of the goalpost is rendered using lines creating a grid pattern typical of soccer goals, with visible intersections that form square or rectangular shapes, despite the stylized depiction.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the soccer ball positioned in the foreground, in front of the goalpost, with part of the goal visible behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B positions the soccer ball prominently in the foreground, with the goalpost clearly situated in the background. The ball's placement overlaps with the goalpost, showing part of it visible behindâ€”indicating the desired positional arrangement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the seams between the black and white panels of the soccer ball clearly visible and aligned with the edges of the pentagons and hexagons?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized representation of the soccer ball includes visible lines indicating seams between the panels. These seams align with the edges, clearly demarcating the pentagonal and hexagonal shapes, consistent with traditional soccer ball design.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the soccer ball centered in the foreground and the goalpost positioned directly behind it in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer ball appears slightly off-center in front of the goalpost, with the goalpost positioned behind it in the background. The composition, influenced by artistic style, suggests some asymmetry in placement, differing from a perfectly centered foreground position.",
