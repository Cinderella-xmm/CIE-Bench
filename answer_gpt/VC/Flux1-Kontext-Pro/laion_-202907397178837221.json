      "question": "Are the wooden truss supports of the railway bridge clearly visible and structurally intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the railway bridge is prominent with visible truss supports, but the color alteration to neon blue changes the details slightly. Despite this, the structural integrity appears intact, as visual cues like the symmetry and positioning of supports align with typical bridge construction principles. In Image A, the ultimate realism would confirm this, but based solely on Image B, the bridge's structure seems consistent and intact.",

      "question": "Is the river present and flowing continuously beneath the bridge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a dark space below the bridge indicative of liquid like a river. This aligns with the common understanding that bodies of water would reflect the color changes due to neon effects. Hence, despite the color alterations, the space below the bridge resembles flowing water, which supports the presence of a river. Image A would specifically verify this continuity visually, yet Image B provides sufficient cues for flow due to reflection and continuity.",

      "question": "Are the red-brick buildings with gabled roofs and chimneys visible in the park area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of red-brick buildings, although their color is altered by blue tones, remains discernible due to their distinct shape and location within the park. The structures maintain architectural features like gabled roofs and chimneys, which are visible from the alterations, consistent with common building elements. These cues suggest visibility in Image B, without absolute reference to prior colors from Image A.",

      "question": "Are the green lawns and paved pathways in the park area clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lawns are visually present as blue-toned areas in the park, which corresponds to the general understanding of visible green spaces tinted blue due to image editing. Pathways also appear in color change, visible through their distinct linear patterns simulating paving, despite not appearing in typical colors due to neon effects. This analysis confirms visibility in Image B through spatial recognition and color pattern understanding.",

      "question": "Is the city skyline located behind the river and bridge, maintaining the original depth order?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the skyline as positioned behind both the river and the bridge, which visually supports depth order perception. Combining visual cues with understanding, cityscapes often maintain depth consistently even through color edits, such as neon effects in Image B. This spatial logic affirms the skyline position remains unchanged despite the artistic alterations, mapped in depth order recognizable in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are two parallel railroad tracks visible along the length of the bridge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bridge itself is edited with neon colors, displaying rail tracks as lines along its length. These follow parallel structure common in railway design. The tracks, although color shifted, remain through the bridge's layout as identifiable features meeting the expectation of parallelism associated with railroad visualization. These patterns correlate with typical rail imagery, seen clearly in Image B.",
