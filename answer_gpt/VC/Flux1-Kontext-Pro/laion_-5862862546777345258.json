      "question": "Is the central arched doorway with a cross above it present in the same position on the church facade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central arched doorway with a cross above it is central to the church's facade within the glass dome. The depiction precisely replicates the frontal architecture of the church, as is typical with such miniaturized representations. Therefore, based on the architectural consistency and the fact that these elements are generally preserved for authenticity, the arched doorway with the cross is expected to be present in the same position on the church facade.",

      "question": "Is the round window located directly above the central doorway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the round window is positioned above the central doorway as part of the church's facade within the dome. This matches architectural norms for this style of building, where such windows are often placed centrally for symmetry and aesthetic balance. By observing the elements in the glass dome and considering typical church constructions, the round window is directly above the central doorway.",

      "question": "Is the bell tower with a dome and spire visible above the church roof?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a church model within a glass dome that includes a bell tower with a dome and spire, just as one would expect in traditional Western church architecture. These elements are distinct and visible above the main roof of the church, ensuring the model accurately depicts these features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are white umbrellas positioned over tables to the left of the church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature scene inside the glass dome does show a representation of white umbrellas over tables, which is intended to replicate a café-like setting. This suggests that the umbrellas are indeed positioned to the left of the church as part of the scene captured within this model.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is a tree located near the café on the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the model within the dome includes small trees, mimicking the outdoor setting adjacent to the church and the café. These trees are proportionally scaled to match the rest of the elements. Consequently, there is a tree located near the café setting on the left side of the model scene.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, showing a model within a glass dome, reveals curved stone steps leading up to the church entrance as part of its replica design. These steps are a prominent architectural feature sculpted into the model to enhance realism and align with usual structures providing access to such buildings.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is a building with blue-and-white tiled walls and black metal balconies visible to the left of the church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no building with blue-and-white tiled walls and black metal balconies is visible next to the church within the encapsulated model scene. Instead, the focus is on the church and its immediate surroundings within the dome only. The visual content suggests the absence of such detailed external surroundings.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bell tower atop the church within the glass dome includes a small cross at its peak, which is a common architectural feature in Christian church designs. This detail is preserved in the model to maintain structural authenticity.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image of the model within the glass dome clearly shows part of the church's roof in red tiles, consistent with traditional design elements seen in church buildings meant to reflect historical styles. The color and arrangement are replicated to ensure accuracy in the model.",
