      "question": "Are the almond-shaped eyes with visible dark eyeliner and defined lashes present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there is no visible evidence of almond-shaped eyes or eye makeup detailing, such as dark eyeliner and defined lashes, that can be assessed. The facial features are obscured, preventing identification of specific eye characteristics. As such, the visual cues combined with common sense lead to concluding that these details cannot be confirmed.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the facial expression is not discernible due to it being obscured, which includes any potential depiction of the mouth forming a smile or showing visible teeth. Therefore, based on the lack of specific visible information, it is not possible to confirm a smile with visible teeth.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the woman maintains an upright posture with visible proportions suggesting a slender build and proportional limbs. This assessment relies on the visible cues from body shape and posture in the context of the ornate setting, consistent with an upright and slender appearance.",
