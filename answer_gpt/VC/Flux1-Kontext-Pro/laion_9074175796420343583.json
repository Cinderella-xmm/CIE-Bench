      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the crisscross lattice pattern of pastry strips visible on the pie's surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pie does not have a visible lattice pattern. It appears to have a smooth surface as shown in the comic panel. The grandmother-like character in the comic is interacting with a standard pie without a lattice top. Based on this observation and common pie designs, Image B depicts a pie with a solid top crust typical of certain baked pastries.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the knife with a metallic blade and wooden handle clearly present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a character is depicted holding a knife with a metallic blade and what appears to be a wooden handle, similar to a kitchen knife. From the interaction scene, the knife is prominent and consistent with the comic style, portraying a kitchen setting.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is a fine dusting of white powdered sugar visible on the surface of the pie, particularly over the lattice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a solid pie crust without visible signs of powdering. Since the pie in Image B has a solid top and the depictions tend to emphasize simple visuals typical of comic art, there's no indication of powdered sugar being present.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the pie crust uniformly golden brown in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the comic representation of the pie illustrates a uniformly brown crust. The shading suggests an even color, typical of a baked pie. The context within a comic doesn't emphasize color variances.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are dark red sections of fruit filling visible through the gaps in the lattice crust?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the absence of a lattice pattern (visualized as a solid crust), there are no visible sections of fruit filling. Comics often simplify food items with clear defined shapes, and the depiction here is of such a pie that does not include any visible filling.",
