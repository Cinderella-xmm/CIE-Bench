      "question": "Is the long, curly, voluminous white beard present and extending down the front of the chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beard is clearly visible, showing long, curly, and voluminous characteristics extending down the front of the chest. The visual cues indicate the familiar appearance of a traditional, exaggerated Santa-style beard, known for its fullness and length. This aligns with common portrayals of individuals dressed as Santa or pirates, where the beard serves as a defining characteristic. Therefore, based on these observations in Image B, the beard is present and extends down the front of the chest.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the thin-rimmed glasses worn on the face, positioned over the eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible thin-rimmed glasses positioned over the eyes. The area where glasses would typically sit is not occupied by any spectacles, suggesting that the character is not wearing glasses.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the right arm extended outward with the palm facing upward and fingers slightly spread?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right arm is extended outward, but the palm is facing outward instead of upward, with fingers slightly spread apart. This suggests a gesture common with waving or greeting, rather than holding or presenting something. Analyzing this visual cue from Image B alone confirms the arm's extended position, but the orientation of the palm does not match the description of facing upward.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the mouth curved upward in a smile and the eyes slightly crinkled at the corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, details about the mouth or eyes are not discernible due to the blurring effect, which obfuscates these features, making it impossible to visually verify the presence of a smile or crinkling eyes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the head turned slightly to the left side of the frame, facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character appears to be facing directly forward rather than turned to the left. The orientation suggests a straightforward pose commonly used in portraits or character presentations, often to directly engage the viewer. Thus, the head is not turned slightly to the left.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features such as the nose, eyebrows, and cheeks are obscured due to the blurring effect, preventing any visual confirmation or comparison with Image A. This makes it impossible to determine consistency between the facial features of the two images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fingers of the right hand are splayed outward with a visible natural spacing between them. This is indicative of an open-handed gesture, often associated with waving or greeting motions. The visual cues clearly depict fingers that are spread apart, without any unnatural crowding, aligning with the description.",
