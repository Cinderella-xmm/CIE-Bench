    "Question": "Q1: Does the clock tower retain its hexagonal shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the structure of the clock tower continues to have angular sides that suggest a geometric shape, specifically a hexagonal shape. Viewing the tower's top, we can see the outline that forms from one side to another, which maintains the visual appearance of a hexagonal shape. Given our understanding of geometry and structure, the presence of these visually straight edges implies that the hexagonal shape is retained.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the clock face still present with Roman numerals?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face clearly displays numbers in a distinctive format that matches Roman numerals. The traditional arrangement of Roman numerals I to XII in circular fashion can be seen, preserving the iconic look of classical clock dials, helping to confirm that the clock face with Roman numerals is still present.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Does the tower still have a balcony with balusters below the clock face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, directly beneath the clock face, one can observe a horizontal extension with small columns which are characteristic of balusters. This part of the structure serves as a balcony, visually similar to architectural features known from other traditional clock towers. The balcony and balusters remain part of the towerâ€™s design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the tower retain its pointed roof structure?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the roof covered in snow, but its underlying form is still revealed as pointed, tapering to the top. The gradual narrowing towards the peak is consistent with a pointed roof design, commonly used for both aesthetic and functional purposes in architecture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the tower retain its green and yellow color scheme, excluding the flags?",
    "explanation": "Despite the snow covering parts of Image B, the lower sections of the tower and parts that are less affected by the snow show an underlying color palette. The use of green on main structural components and complementary yellow on trims and accents remain evident, allowing the conclusion that the original color scheme is maintained beneath the snow.",
    "answer": "Yes"
