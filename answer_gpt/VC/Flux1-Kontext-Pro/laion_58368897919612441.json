      "question": "Are both corner towers with domed roofs and weather vanes present and positioned at the upper corners of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure inside the glass dome has two prominent corner towers, both topped with domed roofs and weather vanes, similar to typical features found in historical architecture. These are placed at the upper corners of the main building as a continuation of traditional fortifications, suggesting consistency with historical designs.",

      "question": "Is the crenellated parapet running along the top edge of the tower intact and continuous?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a row of crenellations running along the top edge of the main tower's walls, typical of castle architecture for defense purposes. These crenellations appear intact and create a continuous line along the top of the building within the glass dome.",

      "question": "Are the arched windows arranged symmetrically across the façade, including the triplet groupings above the main level?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a symmetrical arrangement of arched windows across the façade. These include triplet groupings in the upper sections of the building, maintaining architectural symmetry which is often desired for aesthetic and structural balance.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a central arched entrance at ground level, directly beneath the central section of the façade, with a wooden drawbridge structure extending forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central section of the façade features an entrance at ground level, shaped as an arch. The entrance does not have a drawbridge extending forward, but rather seems to open directly to the steps leading to it, diverging from the typical drawbridge structure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows uniform stonework on the exterior walls without obvious bands of alternating light and dark stones. This suggests a consistent stone texture and coloration throughout the structure's façade, which is common in many historical buildings aiming for uniformity and structural integrity.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a tall, rectangular mass which is commonly seen in traditional fortress designs, with prominence given to the corner towers projecting outward. This configuration provides both aesthetic value and historical fortification functionality, clearly visible within the dome.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden drawbridge leading to the entrance displays beams arranged in a crisscross lattice pattern. This pattern provides structural support and aesthetic detailing, fitting well within the historical context of the architectural style.",
