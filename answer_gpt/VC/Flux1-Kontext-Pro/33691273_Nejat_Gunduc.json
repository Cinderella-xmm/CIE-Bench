      "question": "Is the Coca-Cola bottle present in the advertisement with its distinctive curved shape and visible partial logo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the distinctive curved shape of a Coca-Cola bottle is present and visible next to the man holding what appears to be a sign or poster. The bottle's shape is recognizable due to its unique design, commonly associated with the Coca-Cola brand. The partial logo with the letters is visible at the bottom right of the advertisement, which is iconic and can be identified even with a partial view. Thus, the Coca-Cola bottle and its recognizable logo are depicted in the edited image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the white earbud visible in the woman’s ear with the wire extending downward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no woman depicted with visible earbuds. The focus is on the man in the foreground, and the speech bubbles in the background as part of the Coca-Cola-themed advertisement. Given the visual elements presented, a woman with a white earbud is not visible in this image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are both the man and the woman shown in profile, facing to the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, only a man is visible, depicted from behind and facing what appears to be the right side of the frame. There is no visible depiction of a woman in profile facing any direction. Therefore, the scenario of both a man and a woman shown in profile, facing to the right, does not apply here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the man’s right hand positioned near his ear, holding the earbud in a manner that mimics the woman’s use?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is holding something in his hand, but since there is no woman visible with earbuds, there's no reference to mimic. Moreover, the man does not appear to hold an earbud, hence his posture doesn't suggest any mimicking behavior associated with earbuds.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the top-right corner of the advertisement visibly torn or peeling, revealing the underlying surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a man against a backdrop of a stylized urban scene, associated with a Coca-Cola advertisement. The top-right corner of the image, which is dedicated to this cinematic scene, shows no sign of tearing or peeling. The image seems to have been deliberately designed to appear vintage but without physical imperfections on the corner.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the man positioned in front of the advertisement, partially overlapping it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is part of the main scene rather than positioned in front of a secondary advertisement the way a person might stand in front of a billboard. This scene depicts him holding a speech bubble, integrated within the narrative context. As such, he is not overlapping any advertisement; instead, he is part of it.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized text of 'Coca-Cola' is printed prominently at the bottom left of the image as part of the artwork, ensuring the brand is clearly communicated. Therefore, words representative of the Coca-Cola brand are indeed legible in the advertisement context of the image.",
