      "question": "Is the \"Canon\" logo present in white text on the top of the camera body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Canon' logo is prominently displayed in white text on the top of the camera, similar to its appearance in Image A. This is a common feature for branding purposes on Canon cameras. By examining the central placement and style of the logo, it is clear that the logo matches common Canon branding, confirming its presence in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the \"SX 60 HS\" text visible in silver lettering on the lower right side of the camera body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'SX 60 HS' text appears on the lower right side of the camera body in silver lettering, corresponding with its placement and style in Image A. This marks the model of the camera, making it a crucial detail for identifying the camera's specifications. Its clear and consistent display confirms its presence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the inscriptions \"CANON ZOOM LENS 65x IS\" and \"3.8-247.0mm 1:3.4-6.5 USM\" visible around the lens barrel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the cartoonish depiction, the inscriptions 'CANON ZOOM LENS 65x IS' and '3.8-247.0mm 1:3.4-6.5 USM' are still illustrated around the lens barrel. This matches the technical specifications indicated in Image A, showing that the artist intended to retain these details as part of the camera's identity.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the textured grip area on the left side of the camera body clearly visible with a pebbled or dimpled surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera is turned into a cartoon character, losing some realistic surface details. The grip area is not clearly visible as it would be in Image A, where a textured grip is evident. The anthropomorphized design takes creative liberty, opting for limbs instead of detailed textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the mode dial located on the top left of the camera body, near the grip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B transforms the camera into a character, prioritizing a stylized illustration over functional details. Consequently, the mode dial, a prominent feature seen in Image A, is not distinctly visible or identifiable in the same location in Image B, where creativity supersedes realism.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a small circular flash unit positioned above the lens on the top center of the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flash unit is assimilated into the cartoon design and is not clearly identifiable atop the camera as compared to Image A. The creative design of Image B focuses on the character-like aspects, foregoing some specific elements like the discrete flash unit.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main body of the camera retains its black color, although the context is more illustrative and cartoonish than in Image A. Despite the artistic changes, the primary color remains consistent, preserving a key aspect of the camera's appearance.",
