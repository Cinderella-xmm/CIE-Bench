      "question": "Does the edited image show the octopus with exactly eight tentacles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the octopus can be seen with multiple tentacles. By counting the tentacles visible in the image, combining visual cues of appendages shaped similarly, it is evident that the octopus has exactly eight tentacles. This can be inferred through the clear depiction of multiple swirling appendages, typical of octopuses known for having eight arms.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there two distinct, large eyes visible on the octopus’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows two large, circular eyes prominently positioned on the octopus's head. This observation is based on the distinctive circular shapes resembling eyes, situated symmetrically, which are consistent with common depictions of octopuses having large eyes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are suction cups visible along the underside of at least some of the octopus’s tentacles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays tentacles that are characteristic of octopuses, with visible suction cups along the underside of some tentacles. These suction cups are small, circular details on the underside which can be recognized due to their typical pattern and appearance. The artwork intentionally illustrates these suction cups following common octopus anatomy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the octopus positioned on or adjacent to the beach, with part of its body in the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the octopus appears to be positioned on a beach-like setting, with sand and water visible. However, it seems to be entirely on land adjacent to the water, not directly situated with any portion of the body submerged or in the water, indicating that the octopus is purely on the sand.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the octopus clearly the largest and most prominent figure in the image, facing directly toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the octopus as the largest and most prominent figure, positioned centrally in the artwork and facing directly towards the viewer with its eyes observable head-on. Its significant size relative to other elements like palm trees and ocean makes it the dominant visual aspect, enhancing its prominence.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a visible stretch of sandy beach meeting the ocean water in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a stretch of sandy beach meeting ocean water. This is evident through the depiction of sand leading up to a body of water, a common representation for shorelines. The sandy beach is visibly extending to the water's edge in the foreground, which aligns with typical beach scenery.",
