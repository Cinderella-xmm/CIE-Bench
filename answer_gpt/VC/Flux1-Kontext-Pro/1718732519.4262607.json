      "question": "Is the hot dog represented as an elongated, straight object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hot dog is visually depicted as having an elongated shape, which is evident from its extended length and relatively narrow width. This is characteristic of a typical hot dog presentation, where the sausage or frankfurter is encased within a bun. The sausage within appears straight and uniform, indicating a classic elongated and straight representation. World knowledge tells us that hot dogs are conventionally straight and elongated to fit within their buns.",

      "question": "Is the hot dog placed horizontally on the wooden base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the hot dog is noticeably aligned horizontally, with its length running parallel to the wooden base beneath it. The horizontal placement is typical for serving, allowing the hot dog to be evenly supported by its base. This is a common and practical way to display a hot dog for stability and presentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are both the hot dog and the bottle placed on a flat wooden surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the hot dog and the bottle are resting on what appears to be wooden surfaces. The bottle is directly on the larger wooden surface of the table, while the hot dog is on a smaller raised platform that could be wood or similarly flat materials placed on the table. The image does not explicitly specify the material of each surface, but it gives a coherent appearance that aligns with a flat wooden table setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bottle positioned to the left of the hot dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the bottle is visually located to the left side relative to the hot dog. This spatial arrangement is clear from the image composition, where the two objects are distinct and in close proximity, allowing for a straightforward comparison of their horizontal positions on the table.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the hot dog placed on a raised wooden platform distinct from the main table surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hot dog is positioned on an elevated wooden platform or chopping board. This platform is distinct from the overall table surface on which the bottle stands. The elevation is clear from the shadowing and visual separation between the platform edges and the main table surface. This specific setup is commonly used for serving or displaying food items.",
