      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the woman’s silver hair clearly visible and styled in a short, neat manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area where hair would typically be visible is represented by a solid dark color that suggests the silhouette of a head and shoulders, similar to a cutout or stencil. This silhouette does not show any details such as hair color or style. Typically, if the hair were styled in a specific manner, it would show some pattern or texture, but this is absent here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both hands visibly holding the open book, with fingers wrapped around the edges of the pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands are represented as a dark silhouette holding the book. While they appear to grasp the book, due to the uniform dark coloring, details such as fingers wrapping around pages are not discernible. The edited image lacks the detail necessary to confirm this level of information.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a tabby cat sitting on the red rug in the lower-right corner, facing upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a simplified outline of a cat is visible in the lower-right corner. However, without further details such as distinctive tabby markings, it's not possible to identify it specifically as a tabby or that it's clearly facing upward. The style of Image B does not support detailed texture or directionality.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the armchair have a high backrest, padded arms, and visible wooden legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armchair is depicted with a clear silhouette showing a high backrest and arm design. However, the details such as padded appearance or visible wooden legs are not present. The silhouette style flattens texture details.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a stack of five books on the floor to the left of the chair, with a white mug resting on top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a stack of books with a cup on top with clear discernible outlines. Due to the style, it lacks detailed distinctiveness, which makes counting precise items or identifying the mug as white from the edited representation tricky. Nonetheless, the general configuration aligns with the stack being there.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a white mug on the small wooden side table to the right of the woman?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents an outline of a cup near the right side of the figure. Similar to the book stack, the monocolor silhouette style doesn't reveal the mug’s color or the table material. It, however, corresponds with the spatial arrangement necessary for the mug’s placement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a beige knitted blanket with lace-like patterns draped over the woman’s lap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an elaborate pattern over the woman’s lap area, representing the blanket. While the style abstractly suggests texture, it clearly draws from the original’s blanket styling, keeping the pattern although color identification (beige) is obscured.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the woman seated upright with a slight forward lean, facing the viewer while reading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silhouette style of Image B maintains the woman's basic pose, similar to how she would be seated with slight forward preparation for reading. However, the abstraction of features and angle positioning doesn't convey an explicit face view or orientation towards the viewer.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
