      "question": "Is the barbell rod visibly present and gripped by both hands across the lifter's upper back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lifter is depicted gripping a barbell with both hands. However, the barbell is positioned in front of the lifter's thighs, suggesting a deadlift position rather than being rested across the upper back as in a squat lift. This erroneous inference of the barbell's location stems from the clarity of Image B, where the lifter's grip on the bar in front is apparent. Given these observations, the barbell is not on the lifter's upper back.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lifter's arms and legs are portrayed with significant muscular detail. The depiction includes prominent biceps and triceps, as well as well-defined quadriceps, indicating considerable muscle mass. The artist has emphasized these muscular features, illustrating a high degree of physical fitness and bodybuilding. Therefore, the lifter's limbs display prominent and defined muscle mass.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, you can see a vertical reflective surface positioned behind the lifter, showing part of his back and the surroundings. This reflection demonstrates that the mirror is capturing the opposite side view of the lifter, as well as some elements from the room, such as weights. The mirror's presence is indicated by the visible reflection of the lifter's back, confirming its position behind him.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lifter is shown wearing socks that rise above the ankles, complemented by two white horizontal stripes near their top. The depiction of these socks with a contrasting stripe pattern commonly relates to athletic or sporty socks.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the lifter with short-cropped hair without indications of a beard. The visual representation of the lifter highlights their athletic profile but does not include features of a neatly trimmed beard covering the jawline and chin.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lifter is depicted standing with their feet flat on the ground. However, the knees are not shown to be significantly bent; instead, they appear firm and supportive of the weight. The lifter's posture is straight, suggesting a focused and stable lifting stance, crucial for balance and efficiency when deadlifting. The straight spine and grounded feet exemplify proper lifting posture.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, large rectangular windows with grid lines are prominently featured as part of the background. These windows offer a view that includes abstract designs like red and blue shapes rather than a natural or exterior view that includes trees or foliage. The absence of greenery outside these windows suggests an indoor setting with decorative elements, rather than an open view with natural scenery.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a blue rectangular mat is positioned directly beneath the lifter’s feet. This mat is conspicuous due to its contrast with the flooring and is depicted as serving as a designated workout area, typical in gym settings to provide grip and support during lifting. The mat's positioning and color detail are clearly illustrated under the lifter's stance.",
