      "question": "Is the mustache present and clearly defined above the upper lip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the region that would depict the face is blurred, thus obscuring any facial details including the upper lip area where a mustache would normally be present. This blur prevents visual confirmation of whether a mustache is clearly defined. Therefore, the absence of any visible facial details in this blurred area leads to the conclusion that the mustache is not present or clearly defined.",

      "question": "Are both eyes closed in the facial expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the part of the image where facial features, including the eyes, would be visible is blurred. This makes it impossible to discern the state of the eyes, whether they are open or closed. Due to the lack of visible detail in the relevant region, the conclusion is that we cannot confirm both eyes are closed.",

      "question": "Is the figure’s right arm resting on the back of the chair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure’s right arm is drawn resting on the furniture, as visible in the arm's positioning and posture where the elbow is bent and the hand drapes over the chair. This visual cue strongly suggests that the arm is indeed resting on the back of the chair, characterized by the elbow being at a higher elevation compared to the rest of the body.",

      "question": "Is the figure depicted in a seated position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the figure in a seated position. This is evident from the posture where the upper body leans back and there's a chair visible beneath the figure, coupled with bent legs suggesting the sitting posture. The visual layout as well as the presence of a chair reinforce the idea that the figure is indeed seated.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no presence or textual indication of the number “27826” in the bottom right corner. The image's corner area seems decorative without numeric symbols, contrasting Image A's visible number marking. Thus, the absence of such a number in the relevant area of Image B leads to the conclusion.",
