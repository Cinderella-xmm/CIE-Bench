      "question": "Is the Eiffel Towerâ€™s full lattice structure, including its three-tiered arches and pointed spire, clearly visible and structurally accurate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower is depicted in a simplified, stylized form without showing its distinctive lattice structure, arches, or spire accurately. The image uses graphical and illustrative techniques that abstract the Tower's features for artistic purposes. Without referring to Image A, this artistic simplification indicates a non-accurate structural representation of the Tower.",

      "question": "Are the hedges arranged in a straight line with consistent cubic shapes and even spacing along the left side of the pathway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the hedges in a stylized manner rather than directly depicting their shape and arrangement as seen in Image A. The edited image uses abstract shapes to represent the park features without depicting hedges in cubic shapes or even spacing. This suggests that the hedges are neither in a straight line nor consistently cubic as in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sandy pathway extend directly from the foreground toward the Eiffel Tower, maintaining a straight trajectory without bends or interruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pathway is illustrated directly extending from the foreground toward the Eiffel Tower, resembling a straight trajectory without bends based on the abstract and stylized depiction. There are no visible curves or interruptions along the pathway, aligning with typical route representations in infographic designs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sun located in the upper-left portion of the sky with a clear starburst effect radiating outward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a generic abstracted sky without showcasing specific features like the sun's placement or effects like starbursts, unlike Image A. The simplified artistic style does not depict the sun, which makes the presence of a starburst effect impossible to determine based solely on Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are black lampposts with traditional lanterns evenly spaced along both sides of the pathway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features stylized lampposts along the pathway, but they are depicted as simplified shapes rather than detailed traditional lanterns seen in Image A. Their placement is not accurately portrayed in terms of even spacing, reflecting less emphasis on precise layout but rather focusing on general representation for illustrative purposes.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there multiple individuals visible in the park, positioned naturally along the path and grassy areas, interacting with the environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses silhouettes to represent individuals scattered across the park, indicating a social environment. There are graphic representations of people engaged in various activities along the path, suggesting both walking and resting positions that mimic natural interactions in a park scenario. This conceptual depiction aligns with typical human activity renderings seen in infographic illustrations.",
