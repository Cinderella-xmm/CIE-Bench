      "question": "Is the bag still rectangular in shape with rounded corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shape of the bag can be analyzed as a rectangular form. The visual geometry appears consistent with typical handbag shapes where the outline, edges, and sides suggest a rectangular structure. The corners are rounded, providing a smoother transition between the edges. This is a common design choice in handbags to create a softer appearance. Thus, based on the analysis of Image B, the bag retains its rectangular shape with rounded corners.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a distinct section at the front of the bag that appears to be overridden by a flap.

This design element helps to provide easy access to compartments while maintaining structural integrity.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, a zipper can be discerned along the top edge of the bag, with a pull tab that has a metallic color resembling gold.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beneath the lower edge of the flap on the front section, there are visible indications that suggest the presence of two vertical stitched panels. These panels are likely intended to provide both aesthetic detailing and structural support for the compartments.
