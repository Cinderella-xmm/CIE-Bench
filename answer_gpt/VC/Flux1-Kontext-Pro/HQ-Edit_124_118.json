    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the central waterfall positioned vertically in the middle of the image, descending from the upper cliff to the river below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central waterfall is prominently featured, flowing directly down the center of the image. The water cascades from the upper area of the image down into a river, forming a visually central and symmetrical composition.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a large, curved tree on the left side of the image with a diagonal branch extending upward and bearing clusters of small purple flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a large, curved tree on the left side. The tree has a distinct diagonal branch structure with intricate lighting effects that highlight the clusters of small purple flowers, confirming their presence.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the river originate in the foreground and curve toward the base of the central waterfall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the river is seen starting in the foreground, winding through the scene, and curving towards the base of the central waterfall. The river's path and curving nature create a visual flow leading to the waterfall.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible rocks scattered along the riverbed in the foreground and midground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the river is depicted clearly, the lighting and perspective primarily highlight the flowing water and surrounding landscape, making specific rocks along the riverbed less distinguishable or prominent.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there two smaller waterfalls visible on the right-hand cliff face, behind the main waterfall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The right-hand cliff face in Image B does not feature two distinct smaller waterfalls behind the main waterfall. The main waterfall is the focal element, with any additional watery elements subdued or indistinct.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a dense canopy at the top of the image with sunlight streaming through gaps, creating bright patches on the foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a setting where lighting plays a significant role, particularly with a sunlit area over the waterfall, supplemented by mystical lighting effects from the artificial canopy. The canopy effect is present, but direct sunlight through gaps is less evident due to the stylized lighting.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there small purple flowers growing on the left side of the twisted tree, near the base of its branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a tree with twisting branches where purple flowers are prominently seen, contributing to the image's ethereal feel, particularly around the middle and upper areas rather than predominantly at the base.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there multiple mountain ridges receding into the background, fading into a hazy blue sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background primarily features the continuation of the dense forest and an artificial canopy without distinct mountain ridges fading into a hazy blue sky. The absence of a natural skyline supports a more confined or surreal atmosphere.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    }
