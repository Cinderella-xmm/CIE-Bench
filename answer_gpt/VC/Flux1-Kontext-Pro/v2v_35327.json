      "question": "Is the figureâ€™s skin uniformly colored in a vivid blue tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skin of the figure maintains a vivid blue coloration across visible regions such as the neck, shoulder, and hands. This suggests a deliberate and uniform coloring likely applied through digital means or editing within the image. Therefore, the entire visible skin is consistently colored in blue.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the banana rendered in a metallic gold color with a curved, elongated shape resembling a real banana?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the banana is depicted with a shiny, metallic gold surface. The curvature, elongated form, and details are consistent with the recognizable shape of a real banana. These attributes suggest that the object is intended to represent a banana albeit in a stylized fashion.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, ears) clearly visible and anatomically recognizable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial region is obscured and thus lacks visible facial features like eyes, nose, and mouth. However, the ear remains partially visible and discernible, indicative of anatomical accuracy. Given the specificity of facial features, while not all are observable, some displayed features do maintain anatomical structure.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the hand visible and positioned near the banana, suggesting a prior or ongoing interaction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a clear depiction of the figure's hand, which is painted blue and positioned gripping the banana, reinforcing the impression of an interaction or grip. The positioning is inherently suggestive of contact or manipulation, signifying interaction.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the figure shown in a side profile with the head turned slightly forward, facing right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the figure in a side profile format, with the head turned toward the direction of the banana. The positioning of the head relative to the body and the visible profile view aligns with a side profile orientation but directed in a forward and right-facing perspective.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a background behind the figure, even if it is transformed or warped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a distinctive background characterized by swirling patterns and textured details, suggesting transformation or artistic alteration. This backdrop exists independently from the subject and contributes to the overall aesthetic impression.",
