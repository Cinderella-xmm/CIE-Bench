      "question": "** Are the vibrant, swirling patterns and colors from the original skis retained in the design of the new footwear?\n\n**",
      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boots feature vibrant, swirling patterns with a bold color palette including orange, blue, red, and yellow. This directly mirrors the design of the skis in Image A, where similar swirling patterns and bright colors can be observed. The continuation of these design elements from skis to footwear shows a direct retention of the original aesthetic.",

      "question": "** Is the wooden texture of the original hockey sticks preserved in the new footwear design?\n\n**",
      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boots do not exhibit any wooden texture. They prominently display colorful patterns instead of natural wood grain or texture, which is clearly visible on the hockey sticks in Image A. Thus, the wooden texture is not carried over to the new footwear design.",

      "question": "** Does the new footwear retain a recognizable shape or silhouette reminiscent of the original skis?\n\n**",
      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "The shape of the boots in Image B is distinct from the skis in Image A. Skis have an elongated, narrow form, while boots have a short, sturdy and closed design meant for feet. There is no resemblance in silhouette or shape between the two objects.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden hockey sticks in Image A have a long handle and a curved blade, intended specifically for playing hockey. The boots in Image B do not incorporate these elements; they have a standard footwear shape without features that mimic the sticks' structure.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Both the boots in Image B and the skis in Image A use a bold color palette, prominently featuring orange, blue, red, and yellow. This consistency in coloration shows the same palette has been incorporated into the footwear design.",
