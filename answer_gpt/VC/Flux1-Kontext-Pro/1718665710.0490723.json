      "question": "Does the edited image retain the curly, voluminous dark brown hair with visible wave patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain depicts a stylized version of the character, where the curly, voluminous dark brown hair with visible wave patterns is simplified but still resembles the original hair style from Image A. This is a typical characteristic of chibi or keychain designs, where hair retains its primary distinctive features while being stylized for the miniature size.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the broad shoulder pauldrons with their intricate engraved patterns still present and recognizable in the keychain version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain version retains the broad shoulder pauldrons. Although simplified due to the limitations of space and design in chibi styling, the general shape and feel, including the visible intricate patterns, make them recognizable. The stylization doesn't remove these key components, suggesting that they are meant to represent the characteristics from the original form.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the deep red cloak still draped over the shoulders and visible in the keychain design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain does not show the deep red cloak draped over the shoulders, likely due to the simplification and size constraints of a keychain design. The emphasis in such designs tends to be on preserving distinctive armor traits over fabric materials like cloaks.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the character’s blue eyes clearly visible and retained in the same position on the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The question regarding the eyes cannot be evaluated accurately as the face area is blurred in Image B. Without visibility into this aspect, it's impossible to confirm their presence or positioning.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the high collar with its decorative edge still present around the neck area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain design maintains the high collar around the neck area. While simplified, the collar's decorative and elevated structure is still visible, aligning with its representation in the original image where the high collar is a distinct element of the armor.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the engraved patterns on the chest armor, including the central medallion and symmetrical lines, still visible and preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B presents a simplified version typical of chibi designs, the key elements of the chest armor, especially the engraved patterns and central medallion, are still highlighted and preserved. This points towards retaining the key visual cues for recognition despite stylization.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the character’s face retain the original jawline, nose shape, and cheekbone structure despite stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the blurred face in Image B, it is not possible to analyze whether the character's original facial features are retained in the keychain design. Therefore, we cannot ascertain if the jawline, nose shape, and cheekbone structure are present.",
