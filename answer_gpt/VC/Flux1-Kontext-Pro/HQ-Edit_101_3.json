      "question": "Is the bird rendered in a vibrant yellow color matching the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is depicted as a yellow cartoon rendering on a packaging design. The vibrant yellow color of the bird in Image B seems intended to mimic the lively yellow appearance of the bird in Image A. However, due to the artistic and illustrative style of Image B, there may be slight variations in color vibrancy. Considering the intent and the constraints of printed media, the bird can be considered to have a vibrant yellow color that matches the original inspiration.",

      "question": "Are there distinct black stripes visible on the bird’s wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird, rendered as an illustration, presents distinct black stripes on its wings. These are important for giving detail to the illustrated depiction of the bird. Comparing this to the original Image A, which shows a real bird with noticeable black wing patterns, the illustration in Image B includes these elements to retain accuracy to the source imagery.",

      "question": "Does the bird have a clearly defined round black eye?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an illustration of a bird with a distinctly defined round black eye. This is in keeping with cartoon or illustrative styles, which often exaggerate features for clarity and appeal. In Image A, the real bird's eye is also round and black, but Image B enhances this feature to stand out on the packaging.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cherry blossoms in Image B on the packaging design are illustrated with five rounded petals, depicted in a pale pink color, which matches common depictions of cherry blossoms. In Image A, the flowers exhibit these same botanical characteristics, further indicating the artist's intention in Image B to reflect the natural aesthetic of real cherry blossoms.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bird's feet in a simplified cartoon form, represented in an orange-yellow color, which is consistent with the natural coloration seen in real birds. Image A also depicts the bird with orange-yellow feet, linking the illustration to its real-life counterpart through color choice.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon bird is illustrated with its feet curving around the illustrated branch, showing a gripping position, which is consistent with how birds typically perch. This design choice maintains realism and follows the reference of Image A, which also shows the bird gripping the branch naturally.",
