      "question": "Is there a large, fully bloomed white rose positioned in the bottom-right area of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, a large fully bloomed white rose is clearly visible at the bottom-right corner of the image. It is part of the rose bush in the foreground and prominently stands out against the building in the background. This assessment leverages the visual information from Image B where the roseâ€™s size indicates it is fully bloomed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a pointed arch window with decorative tracery visible on the upper part of the brick building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brick building in the background features a pointed arch window with decorative tracery visible. This conclusion is drawn from the architectural style of the window, which has a pointed top and intricate design elements typical of tracery, visible on the upper sections of the building.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the building have a visible corner formed by two intersecting brick walls meeting at a right angle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of Image B reveals that the building has a visible corner where two brick walls intersect at a right angle. This is evidenced by the shadow and alignment of the brick patterns, creating a clear structural corner in the architecture of the building.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there at least three distinct rose buds visible along the stems, including one with pink tips near the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays at least three rose buds, including one with pink tips near the center of the image. My analysis identifies these buds as partially opened roses along the stems, distinct from the fully bloomed ones, with the pink tips on one indicating it is not yet fully opened.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows dark green leaves with serrated edges along the stems of the rose bush. These leaves are typical for roses and their serrated edges are visually identifiable along with their rich green color, confirming their presence in the image.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The roses in Image B are positioned directly in front of the brick building, creating a clear foreground-background separation. The roses occupy the majority of the foreground, while the brick building acts as the backdrop, distinguishing the two layers visually in terms of perspective and depth.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a tall, vertical brick structure on the left side of the building, which can be identified as a buttress or tower. It rises above the main structure of the building, contributing to the vertical architectural elements consistent with the building's style.",
