      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits the figurine with long blond hair akin to Thor’s usual depiction, reflecting the character's iconic style. While the face is blurred in the image, the presence of long blond hair suggests continuity of the character's hairstyle. Since the beard isn’t visibly highlighted due to the blurred face region, an assumption based on the remaining visual cues suggests possible retention.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B is presented in a standing position reminiscent of the pose in Image A, maintaining a strong and balanced posture characteristic of Thor. The positioning of the arms and the stance reflect similarity in both images, indicating a retention of the same or a very similar pose.",
