      "question": "Are the two large dark boulders positioned in the foreground grassy area near the cliff edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on a large fantasy creature in the foreground. The background features steep cliffs and waterfalls, but there are no visible grassy areas with large dark boulders near a cliff edge like described in the question. Therefore, the analysis indicates the absence of such boulders placed on a grassy area near the cliff edge.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a visible dirt path curving through the grass toward the cliff edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground is occupied by a large creature and rocks, with mist covering part of the ground. There is no visible curving dirt path through the grass toward any cliff edge. The creature appears to be standing directly on rocky terrain without any intricate path visible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are tree branches extending from the top-left corner into the frame, casting shadows over the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, tree branches do extend into the top-left and upper sections of the frame. These branches are part of the scenery and are casting shadows over parts of the scene. The shadows created indicate a light source, enhancing the contrast and atmosphere around the foreground and creature.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sunlight illuminating the scene from the right side, casting warm golden light on the waterfall and mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting primarily comes from the left side of the image, illuminating the creature, waterfall, and surroundings with a cooler light tone rather than a warm golden light typically associated with sunlight. Thus, the illumination scenario mentioned does not align with the image content, as the warm golden light effect is not visible.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a wide river flowing across a flat plain above the waterfall, with scattered green islands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of a wide river flowing across a flat plain above the waterfalls. Instead, the waterfalls seem to emerge directly from an elevated forested area, and the focus is on the fantasy creature rather than a wide river with scattered islands.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there dark, layered mountains visible in the background under a partly cloudy sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a fantastical backdrop where mountains are overshadowed by the predominant presence of the creature, and the sky is largely bright with some clouds. While there is a hint of natural terrain, layered dark mountains are not distinctly visible as described.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there visible mist rising from the base of the waterfall and diffusing into the air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, mist is definitely visible rising from the base of the waterfall. This mist creates an ethereal effect and contributes to the sceneâ€™s atmospheric nature, adding to the visual drama around the creature.",
