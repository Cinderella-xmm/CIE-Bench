        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat depicted on the box is a simplified, cartoon version where intricate details like fur texture are usually minimized for stylistic purposes.

Thus, given the lack of detailed fur depiction due to the artistic style, the sleek fur texture is not retained.",
