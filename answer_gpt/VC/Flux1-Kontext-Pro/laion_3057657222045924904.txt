{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the car proportioned with a long front hood and short rear deck, characteristic of a mid-engine layout?",
    "explanation": "The proportions in Image B suggest a relatively balanced length between the front hood and rear deck rather than an elongated hood typical of a front-engine layout. Sports cars with mid-engine layouts often display such proportions, focusing the weight distribution towards the center of the car. Interpreting this through automotive design principles, the car fits the characteristics of a mid-engine layout.",
    "answer": "Yes"
