    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the layered petal structure around the rim of each vase, with individual petal shapes clearly visible and arranged in concentric rows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vases exhibit a layered petal structure around the rim. Each individual petal is distinct and clearly visible, displaying an arrangement that resembles concentric rows. This is corroborated by the clear definition and alignment of the petals around the rim of each vase, suggesting the retention of the petal structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there exactly two vases present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays three vases positioned side by side in a triangular formation. This perceptible arrangement of three separate vase units confirms the presence of more than two vases within the image, disproving the notion of there being exactly two vases.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the interior of each vase still open and bowl-shaped, allowing visibility into the cavity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the interiors of the vases are distinctly open and reveal a bowl-shaped cavity. The visibility into the inside space of each vase is clear, as the open rims allow sight into each cavity, confirming the presence of open and bowl-shaped interiors.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does each vase have a distinct, flared pedestal base beneath the main body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bases of the vases in Image B show a flared and distinct pedestal shape beneath the main body. This shape is identified by the widening of the base as it reaches the ground. The distinct structural design is evident and consistent across all the vases.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the two vases identical in shape, size, and orientation, with only minor positional offset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The three vases in Image B differ slightly in design details, particularly in color and texture patterns. While they maintain a similar fundamental shape and size, they are not identical due to these variations. Thus, the statement about two vases being identical is incorrect concerning the edited image.",
