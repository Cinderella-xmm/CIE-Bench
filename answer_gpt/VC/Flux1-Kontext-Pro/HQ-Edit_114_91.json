      "question": "Is the anvil’s pointed horn still present and positioned at the same end of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the anvil is depicted in a fantastical setting transformed with vivid elements such as green glowing symbols and moss. However, the anvil’s shape is retained, including its characteristic pointed horn which is positioned at the same end as in a traditional anvil design. Knowledge of traditional anvil shapes, including the pointed horn used for shaping and bending metal, allows identifying its presence despite environmental differences.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the hammer retain a wooden handle connected to its head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer's design is altered to resemble a creature with glowing eyes, deviating from its traditional form. The handle seems to be enveloped by organic matter, such as moss or roots, giving it an appearance distinct from smooth wood. Identification uses knowledge of traditional hammer designs and contrast with fantastical elements incorporated, showing no clear wood handle remaining intact.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hammer resting diagonally across the anvil’s flat surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hammer in Image B is positioned vertically atop the anvil, resembling an organic creature. This differs from the typical diagonal placement of a hammer on an anvil, used for immediate accessibility when working with metal. Observation combines understanding of common hammer placement and the fantastical redesign where positioning enhances the thematic element rather than functionality.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a multi-paned window with frosted glass visible on the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is set in a forest with no indication of structural human-made elements like windows. Instead, it highlights natural surroundings with trees and foliage, diverging from the workshop setting with windows depicted in Image A. Differentiating between these environments uses practical knowledge of interior and exterior settings, recognizing that indoor features are absent.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are multiple metal tools mounted vertically on the greenish-gray wooden wall behind the anvil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is set in a natural environment without man-made walls or tools. Instead, it emphasizes a mystical ambiance in the woods. Knowledge of tool storage in workshops contrasts with non-descriptive forest environments, clarifying the absence of wall-mounted tools.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are green ivy leaves visible growing over the window frame and wrapping around the base of the anvil and hammer handle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an anvil surrounded by organic matter such as moss and roots, with leaves scattered around the forest floor. This stands apart from cultivated aspects of ivy growing around window frames in Image A, indicating adapted naturalistic elements rather than specific ivy growth in a workshop environment. Common environmental differences distinguish these settings and support conclusions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the anvil sitting on a wooden workbench showing signs of wear and dust accumulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the anvil directly integrated with the forest floor surrounded by roots, rather than placed on a man-made object like a workbench. Knowledge of workshop settings features wooden benches for tool placement, contrasting with natural settings where tools lie amongst earth and organic growth.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there visible roots and organic debris scattered on the surface of the workbench?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, roots and organic matter are an inherent part of the anvil and its surroundings, rooted deeply into the forest floor instead of being scattered on a workbench. This adaptation defines the transformative design rather than accumulation typical of debris found in workshop settings. Recognition of forest environments versus indoor workshop conditions helps distinguish between these features appropriately.",
