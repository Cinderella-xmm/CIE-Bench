      "question": "Is the woman’s hairstyle still platinum blonde with shoulder-length soft waves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, there is no direct depiction of a woman's hairstyle, as the focus is on a fragrance bottle. Therefore, the question is inapplicable. However, if referring to Image A, the woman's hairstyle is indeed depicted as platinum blonde with shoulder-length soft waves. Given the focus on evaluating Image B, the understanding must reflect this context.",

      "question": "Does the woman still have bright red lipstick applied to her lips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a fragrance bottle and not a woman's face, so this question does not apply to Image B. While Image A shows a woman who presumably might have lipstick, since the focus here is on Image B, there is no depiction of lips to determine lipstick color.",

      "question": "Are the black vertical slats with copper horizontal lines still present in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include a background setting of vertical slats. In Image A, black vertical slats with copper horizontal lines are evident, indicating a decorative background. As Image B is centered on a fragrance bottle photographed against a plain backdrop, these elements are absent.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, showing a fragrance bottle, does not involve a depiction of a woman's hand or a clutch. In Image A, the woman holds a small red clutch in her right hand. The context of Image B does not have a scene where a clutch would be observable.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B highlights a fragrance bottle with no inclusion of people or an interactive scene, the notion of individuals holding hands is inapplicable. Image A depicts a woman and a man holding hands, but this interaction is not represented or relevant in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a red fragrance bottle, which is designed with a shape reminiscent of an elongated dress. The bottle's curves and embellishments portray a stylized version of the flowing silhouette seen in a dress design. The comparison from Image A, where a red dress with a flowing form appears, aligns conceptually with the bottle's design in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fragrance bottle is prominently red, showcasing this as its primary color. This visual information from Image B directly addresses the question without needing a comparative analysis, unlike Image A, where the focus is not on a bottle. Thus, the red color is clearly observed in Image B.",
