      "question": "Are the stone steps beneath the character present and textured with visible cracks and moss-like details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is seated on a wooden chair rather than stone steps. The setting primarily consists of wood and dark interiors. There are no visible stone steps or textures like cracks and moss. Therefore, there are no stone steps present in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a dark room with a lamp, and there are no arched windows or iron bars visible. The scene is different from typical outdoor settings where windows and bars might be present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes bare branches and a dark setting, giving a gothic vibe, but there are no walls or archways layered with twisting vines with dried leaves. This contrasts with the presence of such vines in outdoor or more exposed settings.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is seated in a wooden rocking chair with her legs down, not crossed, and her hands are not near her chest but rather resting on the chair. This differs from a position on stone steps.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, a basket with candies and a pumpkin are visible. Image B shows a sewing kit on the left, a porcelain figurine near the ground, and an oil lamp on the table to the right of the character, suggesting a reconfiguration of items. The replacement is noticed in the altered setting but somewhat maintains left-right object orientation from the original.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the oil lamp emits a warm glow that gives a golden light to the room, similar in warmth to the glow of the jack-o-lantern in Image A. This type of illumination creates a similar ambient effect in terms of color and warmth.",
