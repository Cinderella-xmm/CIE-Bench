    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the stylized \"P\" logo with a cart-like shape and circular wheel present on the surface of both tarts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is only one tart visible with a stylized 'P' logo on the surface. There is no evidence of a second tart to compare against, so the assessment is solely based on the single tart. In a comparison with Image A, Image B would be different since Image A shows two tarts, but for Image B alone, only one tart has the logo.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the word \"PABLO\" written in uppercase letters beneath the logo on both tarts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'PABLO' is observed below the stylized 'P' logo on the single visible tart. As before, since Image B displays only one tart, there is no second tart for comparison. Reflecting on the comparisons with Image A isnâ€™t necessary for the current state in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the top surface of each tart display a bright yellow layer covering most of the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the single tart displayed prominently shows a bright yellow layer covering the majority of its top surface. Due to the absence of a second tart in Image B, the determination for both tarts is not possible. In contrast, Image A depicts two tarts with bright yellow surfaces.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible white creamy filling beneath the yellow top layer in both tarts, especially in the sliced portion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, containing just one whole tart without any slicing, cannot reveal the internal filling as the edited image does not display a sliced portion, unlike Image A. Thus, there's no visible white creamy filling directly observed.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the crust of both tarts exhibit a golden-brown color with a flaky, uneven edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the single tart from Image B, the crust shows a golden-brown color with a flaky and uneven edge. Since Image B presents only one tart, an assessment of both tarts' crusts is not feasible. In contrast, Image A depicts two tarts with the described crust feature.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the rear tart partially sliced to reveal the internal cross-section of the filling and crust?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, only one tart is depicted, and it is whole without any slicing to show a cross-section. The situation differs from Image A, where the rear tart is indeed sliced. In Image B, no such feature is visible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the whole tart positioned in front of the partially sliced tart, with the latter slightly elevated and angled toward the back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is only a single tart, so there is no arrangement with a whole tart in front and a sliced tart in the back. Contrast to Image A, where such positioning is evident, Image B lacks this spatial arrangement, displaying a singular tart in an outdoor scene.",
