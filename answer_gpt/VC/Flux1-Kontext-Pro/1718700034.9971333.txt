    "Question": "Q1: Are the eyes blue and positioned symmetrically in the face, looking directly forward?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the face is intentionally blurred and therefore does not provide any visible cues to determine the color or position of the eyes. However, when analyzing the image, we typically expect the eyes to be symmetrically placed and facing forward as this is a common human feature - but without visual confirmation, the answer must be based purely on logical assumption with no direct evidence from the image itself.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the nose small, rounded, and centrally located on the face, aligned with the eyes and mouth?",
    "explanation": "The face in Image B is blurred, which prevents us from visually assessing the nose's size, shape, and alignment. While one might expect a central placement of features by human facial structure standards, without distinct visual indicators or the ability to discern these attributes within the image, this cannot be confirmed.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the mouth closed, with natural lips forming a gentle, neutral line centered beneath the nose?",
    "explanation": "Similar to the analysis for the eyes and nose, the blurred nature of the face in Image B makes it impossible to visually assess the mouth's state or alignment. Conclusions based on typical facial structure (that the mouth is centrally located) would simply be speculative without visual confirmation.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the shirt white in color?",
    "explanation": "By observing Image B specifically, the shirt worn by the subject is visibly of a light color. While it appears to be close to white, the lighting can affect this perception. Further confirming this impression, the shirt appears similar to the one from Image A, which is white, supporting the conclusion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the subject standing upright with arms relaxed at her sides and facing directly forward?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject appears to be standing upright with arms at her sides, and the orientation of the body suggests she is facing directly forward. This is inferred from her posture and the symmetry of her shoulders and wings.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the skin tone consistently fair and unblemished across the face and neck?",
    "explanation": "Due to the blurred face in Image B, an accurate analysis of facial skin tone is not possible. However, the visible skin areas like the neck appear fair and consistent in tone, suggesting an unblemished appearance given typical expectations of such imagery. But without full visible confirmation from the face, it's not conclusively answerable.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the facial features symmetrically aligned along the vertical midline of the face?",
    "explanation": "With the face blurred in Image B, no direct assessment of the symmetry of facial features can occur. Generally, human facial features are roughly symmetrical around a vertical midline, and this can be a reasonable assumption, but cannot be confirmed in this case without clear visibility.",
    "answer": "No"
