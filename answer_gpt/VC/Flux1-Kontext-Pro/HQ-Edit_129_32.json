      "question": "Is the ornate bow featuring symmetrical scrollwork and multiple spherical finials present and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornate bow showcases symmetrical scrollwork with spherical finials arranged symmetrically. By comparing this with general knowledge on ornamental keys, these features match the intricate design of classical bow styles often used in antique or decorative keys. The scrollwork and finials appear to be a signature part of the key's design. Image B maintains these featured designs unchanged, retaining its aesthetic and ornamental value.",

      "question": "Is the double-notched bit at the end of the key preserved in its original H-shaped configuration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bit of the key has a double-notched, H-shaped configuration. By applying knowledge of different key types and shapes, this H-shaped configuration is typical and significant in terms of functionality. This specific shape is crucial for the key's intended use in corresponding locks. Upon examining Image B, this shape is preserved, retaining its intended functional appearance.",

      "question": "Are the textured bands along the shaft preserved in their original placement and form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shaft of the key in Image B shows bands with distinct textures positioned in expected places along the shaft. Such details are commonly used to enhance grip and add to the design aesthetics. These bands are visible in Image B and their placement and form appear unchanged when comparing the pattern and proportion typical to such designs.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the key rendered in the original aged golden brass tone with visible highlights and shadows indicating metallic texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B highlights a key with a golden brass tone that reflects the properties of aged metal with visible highlights and shadows, providing a dimensional and authentic appearance. Using general knowledge about metallic surfaces, the highlights and shadows are signs of its metallic texture. These are visual indicators of brass materiality, showing that the rendering in terms of color and texture is consistent with traditional aged golden brass.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the spherical finials positioned symmetrically around the scrollwork in the bow as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's bow exhibits spherical finials organized symmetrically around the scrollwork, consistent with traditional motifs utilized for balance and symmetry in decorative keys. This symmetry in positioning is apparent and correlates with traditional design aesthetics, where such features enhance the ornamental balance. This aspect of placement around the scrollwork appears maintained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the key proportionally accurate, with the bow, shaft, and bit maintaining their original relative dimensions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In evaluating Image B, the proportions between the bow, shaft, and bit seem consistent with general knowledge of key design, where each element (bow, shaft, bit) maintains proportion for aesthetic and functional consideration. Comparing these proportions with typical designs, the elements are well-balanced, which confirms that Image B maintains these original relative dimensions without distortion.",
