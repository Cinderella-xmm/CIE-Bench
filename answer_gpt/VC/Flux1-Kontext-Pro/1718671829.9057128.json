      "question": "Is there a bench positioned on the left side of the porch, facing inward toward the cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a wooden bench on the left side of the porch. Its orientation and the way it's drawn suggest it's facing inward towards the cabin, aligning with typical porch designs. The portrayal uses line and shadow to emphasize the bench's placement and direction, drawing from common porch setups.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a large vertical glass panel or sliding door on the front face of the cabin, emitting warm light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does showcase an entrance on the front face of the cabin, accented with wood detailing. However, it appears solid rather than glass or sliding. The design elements present an artistic portrayal with no explicit warm light depicted. In Image A, the door indeed is a glass sliding type that shows warm light. The edited version focuses more on illustrative style, omitting these specific features.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a bright circular moon located in the upper right portion of the sky, above the distant hills?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The moon in Image B is vividly drawn, larger than typical and stylized with radiant lines around it, positioned above the dark silhouette of the hills in the sky's upper region. This artistic enhancement prioritizes a mystical vibe over Image A’s realistic scale and shading of the moon, situated similarly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there vertical wooden support beams forming the porch structure directly in front of the cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B artistically renders the porch's vertical wooden beams with intricate design and wooden patterning as essential structural elements in front of the cabin. They are clearly visible and contribute to the architectural style, similar to the realistic wooden beams found in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there visible warm interior lighting emanating from within the cabin through the glass wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cabin does not visibly show warm interior lighting like Image A. Instead, the style uses muted tones for the interior, omitting overt light emanation through any presumed glass wall, focusing instead on illustrating texture and form.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a stylized depiction of vegetation, incorporating small flowering elements along the lower right foreground. This detail holds true to Image A's realistic approach where white blossoms appear in the similar position, signaling continuity in outdoor scenery.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there dark silhouetted hills or mountains visible in the background, below the moon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows dark mountainous formations under the moon, linking to natural silhouettes typical in nighttime scenery. The hills' portrayal is consistent with Image A’s realistic dimming yet powerful backdrop under lunar influence.",
