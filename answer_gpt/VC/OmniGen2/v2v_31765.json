      "question": "Is the pile of diced vegetables on the left side of the image orange in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pile of diced shapes on the left side is predominantly orange in color. The vibrant orange hue is distinct and typically associated with carrots, which are commonly diced for use in various dishes. The use of bright colors and distinctive shapes is a common characteristic of cartoon or stylized imagery.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the green vegetable pieces in the center of the image have a curved, C-shaped form with a visible hollow center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green shapes in the center exhibit a distinct curved or C-shaped form, with a visible hollow area in the center, representing stylized celery slices. Such celery shapes are standard in food images, especially when simplified visually as in this stylized representation.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the diced vegetables on the right side of the image pale white or translucent in appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pieces on the right side are a pale yellowish-white color. In the edited image, due to the stylization, the pieces have a more solid appearance compared to a natural translucent look of real onion pieces. However, the pale color indicates they represent onions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a knife with a metallic blade and black handle located in the upper right portion of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a knife is located in the upper right portion. It shows a blue blade and a stylized design, diverging from typical metallic appearances. However, it visually aligns with typical representations of knives, and although the color is blue, this is an intentional artistic choice in the style of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the surface beneath the vegetables and knife a wooden cutting board with visible horizontal grain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface beneath the vegetables and knife is a flat, cartoonish background rather than a realistic texture. The colors are gradient but do not simulate a wooden grain. It suggests a simplified surface without detailed wood texture.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the three piles of vegetables—carrots, celery, and onions—are aligned in a horizontal row. They are arranged from left to right, with carrots on the left, celery in the middle, and onions on the right. This arrangement is not triangular but linear.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knife is positioned in the upper right area of the image, located adjacent to the pile representing onions. Its orientation is such that it covers this area diagonally, consistent with the usual placement of knives in such setups.",
