      "question": "Is the leaf in the edited image still ovate with a pointed tip and serrated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf's shape can be described as ovate with a pointed tip and serrated edges. These features are evident from the visual inspection of the leaf within the snow globe, where the leaf's silhouette and contours can be seen clearly. This matches with the common characteristics of ovate leaves which are pointed and serrated.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the leaf retain the prominent central vein with branching secondary veins forming a network across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf's prominent central vein is visible, with secondary veins branching off to form a network across its surface. This is a typical structure for leaves, and the visibility of these veins is consistent in the depiction within the snow globe.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the leaf still golden-yellow with visible brown speckles and natural discolorations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf maintains a golden-yellow hue. However, the visibility of brown speckles and natural discolorations is less apparent due to the lighting and artistic rendering inside the snow globe, which emphasizes a warm glow around the leaf. Despite this, the general golden-yellow color is retained.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the leaf retain its papery texture and minor surface imperfections such as blemishes or spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the texture does not explicitly convey papery texture due to the artistic rendering within the snow globe, the leaf still appears to reflect some imperfections which align with the natural characteristics of a real leaf. Thus, we can reasonably affirm that such details are intended to signify these natural attributes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the leaf oriented with the stem pointing toward the upper left and the blade extending diagonally across the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf is positioned with the stem pointing upwards rather than to the upper left, divergent from the diagonal orientation described. This orientation within the snow globe setting does not match the orientation specified in the question.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the leaf the sole central object in the edited image, without any other competing elements in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf is the primary focal point within the snow globe, surrounded by decorative snowflake-like elements. While these elements add context and aesthetic, they do not compete for central focus. The leaf remains the sole prominent object within the central visual field.",
