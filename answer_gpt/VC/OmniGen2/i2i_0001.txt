    "Question": "Q1: Does the chibi keychain feature a large, singular pearl earring on the girl's left ear?",
    "explanation": "By observing Image B, we can see the chibi keychain shows a stylized cartoon character. Typically, chibi figures emphasize facial features with simplified details, but in the presented keychain, the girl does not appear to have any pearls or earrings visible near her left ear. This simplification is common in chibi designs. Visual cues from the image confirm no such accessory is present.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the chibi figure wearing a headscarf with distinct blue and yellow sections?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character has a turquoise blue helmet-like hair design that resembles neither scarves nor the distinct blue and yellow sections. Chibi designs simplify forms, often resulting in single-color hair accessories or shapes. The turquoise hair is homogenous and does not reflect a headscarf with separate color sections.",
