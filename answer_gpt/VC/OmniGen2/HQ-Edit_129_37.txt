    "Question": "Q1: Are the cardinal direction labels N, E, S, and W clearly visible and correctly positioned on the embossed compass face of the perfume bottle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a perfume bottle designed to mimic a compass. Observing the embossing on the bottle, the cardinal direction labels N, E, S, and W are key indicators of a compass representation. However, the labels are not visibly identifiable in the image provided. Typically, these labels are placed at 90-degree intervals around such a compass design. Without seeing these crucial directional markers clearly positioned, we conclude they are not present or visible.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the full 360-degree scale with numerical markings (e.g., 0, 90, 180, 270) present and evenly spaced around the outer edge of the embossed compass face?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B closely, there are no visible numerical markers that would indicate a full 360-degree scale commonly used on traditional compasses. These numerical markers are typically placed at equal intervals, and their absence makes it clear that such a scale is not present.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the embossed compass face retain the original eight-pointed star-like radial pattern with symmetrical arms extending from the center?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear depiction of an eight-pointed star-like pattern on the embossed face of the perfume bottle. This design is fundamental to compass faces, representing both cardinal and intercardinal directions. The pattern is symmetrical, with arms extending from the center, indicating that this feature is retained in the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the body of the perfume bottle perfectly circular in shape, matching the original compassâ€™s outline?",
    "explanation": "Observing the shape of the perfume bottle in Image B, it is clearly a perfectly circular design. This circular shape is consistent with the traditional outline of a compass, suggesting that the bottle's shape was intentionally made to replicate the compass design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the cap of the perfume bottle feature engraved cartographic details such as a compass rose and intersecting grid lines, matching those seen on the map fragments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cap of the perfume bottle is visible, but it does not show any specific cartographic details like a compass rose or intersecting grid lines. Such details would be intricate and distinct, visibly noticeable on the small surface of the cap, but they are absent in this image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a small central raised dot or hub at the exact center of the embossed compass face, corresponding to the original needle pivot?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the embossed compass face on the perfume bottle, featuring a central raised dot or hub. This design element corresponds to the typical pivot point for a compass needle, indicating attention to detail in mimicking traditional compass design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the outer ring of the embossed compass face clearly delineated with fine engravings and consistent spacing between degree marks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the outer ring of the embossed compass face does not exhibit fine engravings indicative of degree marks or consistent spacing. This lack of detailed engravings suggests that such a feature was not included in the design.",
    "answer": "No"
