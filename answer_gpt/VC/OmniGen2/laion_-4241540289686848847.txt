    "Question": "Q1: Does the character retain the golden-yellow eye color?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, despite the blurred face making specific eye details indiscernible, it is noted that the setting and character design is distinct from Image A, which features the character in golden-yellow eye color styling. However, without being able to view the eyes from Image B, the character's eye color can't be definitively identified, leading to the conclusion of 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the character’s facial structure (jawline, cheekbones, nose shape) preserved?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not provide visibility of facial features such as the jawline, cheekbones, or nose due to the blurred face. Therefore, these features cannot be confirmed as preserved from Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the character’s skin tone and texture preserved?",
    "explanation": "The edited face in Image B does not reveal the skin tone and texture visible in Image A due to the blur. Thus, original features like skin tone and texture are not preserved.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the character’s body proportions and stance preserved?",
    "explanation": "Comparing both images, Image B maintains similar body proportions and stance with arms out and standing posture as Image A. The designs differ, as seen with the attire; however, the body's proportions and overall posture are preserved.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the camera angle and lighting direction preserved?",
    "explanation": "The camera angle in Image B is positioned closer and more centered, clearly differing from Image A's angle and lighting direction, which is somewhat more obscured from higher positioning and direction. Thus, these aspects are not preserved.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the character’s relative position to the background preserved?",
    "explanation": "Despite differing elements in both images, the character's position relative to the background remains centered. Even with adjustments in scenery (rocky background in Image A, bookshelves in Image B), the central position is maintained.",
    "answer": "Yes"
