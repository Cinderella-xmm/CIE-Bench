    "Question": "Q1: Are there two separate, cushioned backrest sections positioned side by side?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the backrest is represented as a cloud, which forms a unified and continuous shape rather than distinct separate sections. The cloud design implies a metaphorical interpretation of comfort without necessarily reflecting distinct, traditional cushion sections as expected in a typical sofa. Thus, there are not two distinct cushion sections in the backrest as clouds don't inherently have separations.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there two armrests, one on each side of the sofa, aligned with the seat cushions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cloud-like sofa design clearly presents two armrests that are shaped as cloud puffs on each side of the seating area. These cloud puffs visually mimic the conventional placement and alignment of armrests relative to the seat cushions, with a cloud motif replacing traditional upholstered material.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the sofa have four legs, one at each corner of the base?",
    "explanation": "Despite the transformation into a cloud, the base of the sofa in Image B maintains a wooden frame that includes four legs, one at each corner, just like a traditional sofa. This suggests structural stability and is part of the whimsical placement of the cloud on a realistic base.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the sofa symmetrically arranged along a vertical centerline, with identical features on the left and right sides?",
    "explanation": "The sofa in Image B is designed to appear symmetrical, with both cloud shapes and the wooden frame presenting balanced features on either side of a centerline. This symmetry includes the equal-sized and shaped cloud armrests and matching cloud structures."
    , "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the seat cushions positioned directly beneath the backrest cushions, forming a continuous seating surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cloud that acts as the backrest seamlessly transitions into the seat area. Unlike traditional designs, this cloud-themed design makes the entire seating surface appear fluid and interconnected, lacking a clear distinction between backrest and seat cushions. Thus, it appears as a continuous surface from back to seat.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there small black circular fasteners visible on the wooden frame, particularly near the armrest joints?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cloud-styled sofa retains the visible wooden frame with black circular fasteners near the armrest joints, which are consistent features seen in traditional furniture designs to suggest mechanical connections or reinforcements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
