      "question": "Does the edited image retain the semi-circular arrangement of seating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, we observe that the seating is arranged in a semi-circular pattern, similar to what is found in traditional amphitheaters. This arrangement is evident by the curved rows that follow a semi-circular trajectory, a common architectural feature in historical amphitheaters designed for optimal viewing of events. Therefore, the edited image does preserve this element.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the tiered wall with arches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiered wall includes arches placed one above the other across multiple tiers, which reflects the architectural design seen in amphitheaters. There are clearly defined levels of arches, resembling historic tiers that separate seating sections. This tiered structure is consistently visible, indicating retention of the design.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the relationship between the seating and the stage area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B indicates a stage-like area at the center-bottom of the seating arrangement, similar to the performance areas found in real amphitheaters, where attendees would direct their attention. This relationship suggests a preservation of the fundamental layout connecting the audience to the performance spot.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the even spacing of the arches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arcs depicted in Image B are evenly spaced across each tier. The spacing appears consistent, both vertically and horizontally, mirroring the symmetrical and informed architectural decisions used in historic amphitheater construction, where uniformity in structural elements was prevalent.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall silhouette of the structure in Image B portrays the familiar rounded and layered outline, characteristic of amphitheaters. The spatial layout, including the arch-tier design and semi-circular seating, preserves the signature shape that defines such historical edifices.",
