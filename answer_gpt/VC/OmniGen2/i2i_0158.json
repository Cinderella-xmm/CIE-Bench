      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are multiple car models shown. The red color is visible in the front and side views of one vehicle; however, a second vehicle is shown in a blue color, indicating rendering is not consistent across all views. Thus, the answer is No.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes front views of different cars, the LED daytime running lights appear consistent in style and configuration when comparing views from the front and side of the red vehicle in the original positioning.
