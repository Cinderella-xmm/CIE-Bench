      "question": "Does the mouse retain its brown, orange, and white fur pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mouse is depicted with a cartoonish, simplified style rather than realistic fur. The fur pattern is primarily orange with some darker and lighter shades but does not closely align with the naturalistic brown, orange, and white pattern typically seen in real mice. The transformation into a cartoon style creates a more vibrant and exaggerated coloration, which deviates from natural patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the mouse's whiskers and large ears clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon mouse features exaggerated and distinctive whiskers and large ears, consistent with common cartoon depictions. The elements are prominently designed to emphasize cuteness and expressiveness, which is typical in cartoon animal renderings.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the food crumbs present on the floor near the mouse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visually identifiable objects that represent food crumbs scattered on the floor near the cartoon mouse. These are depicted in a stylized manner, consistent with the overall cartoon theme, yet they are still recognizable as crumbs due to their placement and context.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the mouse positioned near the crumbs and looking downward towards them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon mouse is positioned directly adjacent to the food crumbs on the floor and is depicted looking downward towards them. This positioning suggests its interest or interaction with the crumbs, aligning with typical cartoon character behavior where expressions and postures visually express such involvement.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the general kitchen setting with flooring and cabinets identifiable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a setting with tiled flooring and what appears to be cabinetry in the background. These elements establish the environment as a kitchen, maintaining the context of the original image in a simplified and stylized representation.",
