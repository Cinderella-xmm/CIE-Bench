      "question": "Is the fan-shaped headdress with radiating elements present on the warrior’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a LEGO-inspired warrior figure with rounded, block-like features. LEGO designs often simplify complex shapes into basic forms. The headdress is represented with a rounded helmet shape rather than the elaborate radiating elements seen in Image A. By analyzing the visual elements of Image B, we can observe a simplistic representation, confirming the absence of a fan-shaped headdress.",

      "question": "Is there a circular emblem located at the center of the chest plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B confirms the presence of a circular emblem on the LEGO figure's chest plate. LEGO figures often use simple geometric shapes to denote details. The circular element is visually clear on the chest plate in a simplistic form, indicating its existence.",

      "question": "Is a spear held in the warrior’s right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The warrior in Image B does not hold a spear in his right hand. Instead, the LEGO figure's hand is empty, which can be deduced by observing that LEGO figures typically hold items with distinct shapes, but no such item is present here.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO-inspired design simplifies details typically found in more intricate designs. The torso and legs are covered in block-like and smooth patterns, typical of LEGO's representation, thus confirming the absence of layered, scale-like armor pieces.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO statue on a plain white pedestal without visible plaques. This design choice aligns with the simple nature of LEGO representations, which typically do not include intricate details like plaques.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The positioning of the statue in Image B suggests it is centered, with the gallery walls providing equal spacing on each side. This spatial arrangement is typical for gallery displays to focus on the artwork.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features characteristic of warriors, such as a broad nose, deep-set eyes, and a stern mouth, are absent in this LEGO figure. LEGO figures typically have simplistic, minimalistic facial proportions and expressions.",
