      "question": "Is the woman’s hairstyle still platinum blonde with shoulder-length soft waves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of a woman or her hairstyle, as the image features a fragrance bottle. Image A, however, showcases a woman with platinum blonde shoulder-length soft waves. Since Image B only includes the perfume bottle, the question cannot be answered from this image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the woman still have bright red lipstick applied to her lips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses solely on a red perfume bottle, lacking any depiction of people. Image A features a woman who could logically have bright red lipstick given her attire and the red theme. However, for Image B, there are no lips visible, thus this question is not applicable.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the black vertical slats with copper horizontal lines still present in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a solid black background with no visible elements like black vertical slats or copper horizontal lines, which are present in Image A. Therefore, the background elements from Image A are absent in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the small red clutch still visible in the woman’s right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a perfume bottle and not any person or object akin to a clutch. Yet, in Image A, the woman holds a small red clutch in her right hand. Hence, the clutch is absent in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a perfume bottle without any human interaction such as handholding. Image A includes a woman holding someone's hand, but Image B does not include people or handholding, thus not applicable.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fragrance bottle indeed maintains an elongated, flowing silhouette similar to the original dress's design. The red floral design on the bottle echoes the dress's aesthetic from Image A.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Is the fragrance bottle still predominantly red in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a fragrance bottle that is primarily red in color, which complements the red thematic elements of the dress shown in Image A. Thus, the color dominance is consistent with the imagery of Image A.",
