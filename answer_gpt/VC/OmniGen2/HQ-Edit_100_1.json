      "question": "Does the edited image retain the tree's central position with a wide, spreading canopy and visible branching structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree is centrally positioned within a shadow-box style frame, with its wide, spreading canopy filling much of the box's space. The branching structure is visible and clearly defined within this three-dimensional representation. This is similar to how the tree occupies a central spot in Image A, with its canopy spreading widely across the scene and branches visibly articulated. Hence, the tree in Image B retains these structural features.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the leaves of the tree still displaying a visible gradient from green to orange and red?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the leaves of the tree as uniformly green without any gradient from green to orange and red. This contrasts with Image A, where the leaves display a gradient transitioning smoothly from green through shades of orange to red, suggesting seasonal change or lighting effects. Image B lacks this color transition and instead presents a simplified color scheme.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the meadow clearly divided into a pink/red floral area on the left and a green daisy-filled area on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the meadow-like base is uniform with multicolored flowers scattered across the green grass inside the shadow box. It does not display a clear division between a pink/red floral area and a green daisy-filled area as seen in Image A, which clearly shows such a division, representing different floral regions on either side of the tree. Therefore, Image B does not have the same division.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are white daisies still present in the green section of the meadow on the right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a variety of colored flowers, including some white ones, scattered across the grass. However, the absence of a distinctly divided green section means there isn’t a specific area where white daisies are collectively present as seen in Image A, where they are featured prominently on the right side of the meadow. Due to this lack of defined section division in Image B, the white daisies aren’t specifically part of a green section.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a visible glow or backlight effect shining through the tree’s leaves from behind?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include any visual indication of a glow or backlight effect shining through the tree's leaves. Image A beautifully depicts such an effect, where sunlight filters through the leaves creating a luminous glow. The edited illustration focuses more on a stylized representation without light interaction effects.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the tree's base visibly rooted in the ground of the meadow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree appears inside a shadow-box with a flat ground representation of grass and flowers, but it does not visibly show the roots connecting directly into the ground, as one might see in a real setting. In Image A, the tree sits naturally on the meadow with its trunk connecting to the earth, clearly rooted in the ground. Image B simplifies this aspect into a more stylized format.",
