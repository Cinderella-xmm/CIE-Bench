    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the pig’s snout clearly visible with two distinct nostrils and a rounded, pink shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the pig's snout is not visible due to the blurred area covering its face, hence it cannot be evaluated in terms of its visibility or shape. Based on the visual information, there is no distinct outline or texture indicating a snout.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the pig’s ears large, upright, and pink with visible inner ear details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig has large upright ears that extend beyond the blurred area, allowing the characteristics to be assessed. The ears appear pink, and their size and orientation are consistent with the description provided. However, the inner ear details are obscured by the blur.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the sunglasses red in color with round lenses and a thin frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunglasses are included within the blurred region and hence, cannot be visually confirmed as red with round lenses and a thin frame. The blur obscures these features.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a black turntable with a silver platter, tonearm, and mixer controls beneath the pig’s hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a depiction of DJ equipment with visible controls, likely representing a turntable. However, due to stylization and the blur obscuring the specifics, distinct characteristics such as a silver platter or tonearm are not clearly discernible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are black over-ear headphones draped around the pig’s neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, elements around the neck area are covered by the blur, obstructing a clear view of potential headphone details, such as color or style, hence the presence of black over-ear headphones cannot be verified.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the pig wear a red short-sleeved shirt with a visible collar and sleeves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the blurred area, the general form and color of a shirt are discernible surrounding the blur. The shirt appears red and seems to have a short-sleeved design, though visibility of specific details due to blur is limited.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the pig’s front hooves placed on the turntable platter and mixer controls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig is depicted interacting with DJ equipment identical to the turntable setup, and the hands appear positioned to suggest engagement with controls, although precise verification of position relative to platter is not feasible due to stylization.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the pig’s skin pink with visible texture, including subtle wrinkles and light reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image primarily renders the pig stylized and partially obscured due to blur, preventing a detailed view of skin texture or reflections. While pink coloration is suggested through the visible outline of arms, the depiction lacks granularity in texture analysis.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
