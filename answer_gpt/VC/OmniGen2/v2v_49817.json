      "question": "Is the pencil sharpener still present and serving its function in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the scene is transformed into an ancient Egyptian relief style, focusing on tools and interactions relevant to Egyptian imagery. There is no visible pencil sharpener present, as modern objects are typically absent in such historical representations.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the three individuals still interacting in their respective roles (scribe, observer, attendant)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, which is styled as an ancient Egyptian relief, two figures are engaged in an interaction involving writing tools, indicating a scribe-like role. The third individual, depicted standing in the background as a smaller figure, likely serves an observer role. The transformation suggests their roles are maintained but adapted to the historical context.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image mimics a relief sculpture, where background elements like windows are typically not depicted. Instead, the focus is on the figures and symbolic elements, and no windows are visible in the relief background.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image presents a relief style typical of ancient Egyptian artifacts, where details such as modern-day papers and pencils do not appear. The surface area focuses on Egyptian cultural symbols and tools, replacing any modern objects.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the central configuration involves two main figures engaged in an activity with a third observing. Despite the shift from a modern to an ancient setting, the relative positioning of the figures remains similar, maintaining the interaction.",
