      "question": "Is the dog's pose still focused on the tennis ball, with the ball near its nose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no real dog shown. Instead, it features a chibi-style representation of a dog on top of a large tennis ball, with the tennis ball being held by the chibi dog. This animated style means the dog's pose cannot be the same as in a real-life scenario captured in Image A. Therefore, the concept of a dog focusing on a tennis ball with the ball near its nose, like in a photographic capture, does not apply in the same sense to the stylized chibi figure.",

      "question": "Does the tennis ball retain its green color with a pink stripe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis ball is depicted in a stylized, cartoon form. It retains a green color which is consistent with traditional tennis balls, but the pink stripe, often a feature seen in unique or colorful tennis balls in real life, is not visible. Instead, the design features typical tennis ball colors, with a dark green stripe. Therefore, the edited image does not have the pink stripe.",

      "question": "Is the dog still depicted as observing or interacting with the tennis ball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is not depicted as a realistic animal interacting with the tennis ball as in the typical scenario of a dog being curious or playful. Instead, it's a chibi-style cartoon dog character holding the tennis ball initially for decoration. Thus, the depiction isn't of observation or interaction in the conventional sense but rather a playful, stylized presentation.",

      "question": "Does the dog's posture still reflect a prone, ball-focused position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B does not feature the dog in a naturalistic pose, but rather as a cartoon figure sitting on top of a tennis ball, its posture is not prone or realistically ball-focused. The concept of a prone position here does not apply in the edited image's cartoon style.",

      "question": "Is the texture of the tennis ball (felt-like surface) still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis ball is stylized and part of a cartoon or animated representation, which does not capture realistic textures. Cartoon textures tend to be smooth and lack the tactile detail, such as the felt texture found in real-world tennis balls. Thus, the realistic felt-like texture is not present.",
