      "question": "Are the four minarets positioned symmetrically—two on the left and two on the right—relative to the central dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the minarets are positioned with two on each side of the central dome, creating a symmetrical arrangement. This is evident from their equidistant placement on either side of the main structure, which is typically a characteristic of mosque architecture, meant to balance the aesthetic of the building.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the 15 July Martyrs Bridge clearly visible in the background, crossing the water behind the Hagia Sophia?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show a background or elements that resemble a bridge spanning across water behind the Hagia Sophia. There is a large, illuminated winged statue added above the structure, and the scene is set against a dark, starry sky, which does not provide any view of the bridge in question.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is a large body of water visible behind the Hagia Sophia, extending toward the horizon with boats on its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses on the night sky and the illuminated building below the statue. The backdrop is dark with celestial elements, and does not include any visible water bodies or boats, which are evident in daytime conditions as seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are green trees visible in the foreground, partially obscuring the base of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground depicts the Hagia Sophia without any trees obscuring the base of the structure. The focus is on the architecture and the added statue rather than the surrounding environment, and no greenery is visible.",

      "question": "Are multiple arched windows visible on the front-facing wall beneath the central dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does show multiple arched windows on the front-facing wall of the Hagia Sophia beneath the central dome. These windows are part of the architectural design intended to allow light into the interior. Their presence as visible architectural features is consistent with the original structure.",
      "weight": 1,

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are several smaller domes visible around the base of the central dome, forming a tiered roofline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several smaller domes are visible encircling the base of the central dome, which is a characteristic of the Hagia Sophia's multi-tiered architectural layout. These smaller domes contribute to the building's silhouette and are prominent in the image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the sky uniformly clear and light blue, indicating daytime conditions without clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B is depicted as a dark, starry night sky, indicating nighttime conditions, and does not have the light blue, clear appearance associated with daytime as seen in Image A.",
