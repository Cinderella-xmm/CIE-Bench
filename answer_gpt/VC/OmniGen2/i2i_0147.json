      "question": "Are the ketchup and mustard still visibly drizzled on the hot dogs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible condiments on the hot dog are not ketchup but rather seem to be mustard. There are also crispy fried onion toppings. In contrast, Image A shows both ketchup and mustard drizzled on the hot dogs. The visual cue in Image B lacks any red-colored condiment like ketchup, with the focus instead on the yellow coloration typical of cheese or mustard. Therefore, based on world knowledge and direct observation, Image B does not display both ketchup and mustard as in Image A.",

      "question": "Do the buns retain their lightly toasted texture and golden color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buns appear to have a lightly toasted texture and a golden hue. The char marks characteristic of grilling are absent in both images, indicating a uniform texture without excessive darkening. The consistent golden-brown color in both images suggests that the buns' toasted appearance has been retained.",

      "question": "Are the black grill bars and orange flames underneath them still visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows black grill bars with orange flames underneath, similar to Image A. This is an important visual cue that helps maintain the context of grilling for both images. The presence of these elements, which can be associated with grilling from general knowledge, is consistent in both images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the hot dogs still properly positioned inside their respective buns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hot dog is positioned well inside the bun with the condiments and toppings clearly on top, very similar to the positioning seen in Image A. The structural setup of culinary presentation is thus maintained, ensuring that hot dogs remain neatly arranged within their buns.",

      "question": "Does the image retain a dark background to emphasize the food?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B appears dark, with the focus primarily on the hot dog and bun, creating a contrast with the brightly lit food items similar to what is observed in Image A. This stylistic choice is common in food photography to enhance visual appeal and direct viewers' focus on the subject.",
