    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the player depicted wearing a red shirt with black shorts in all frames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe the player is indeed wearing a red shirt and black shorts. Since Image B is completely blank, there's no information provided to contradict these observations, leading to the conclusion that the depiction remains consistent.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does each frame show the player dynamically engaged with the tennis racket and ball, mimicking a natural hitting motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the player is depicted as actively reaching for the ball with a racket, suggesting dynamic engagement and a natural hitting motion. Image B doesn't have multiple frames, but maintaining the same scenario across multiple identical-like frames logically supports this consistency.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the racket and ball consistently positioned to indicate a realistic hitting action in every frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ball is positioned just before making contact with the racket, which suggests a realistic hitting action. The lack of multiple frames in Image B leaves no reason for variation, supporting consistent positioning.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the player retain his short dark hair in all frames of the sequence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the player with short dark hair, and without direct physical changes visible within the singular frame provided, the hair style and color would typically remain unchanged across identical-like frames.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the yellow tennis ball appear consistently across all frames, maintaining its bright color and position relevance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis ball is clearly bright yellow and is positioned near the racket, indicating relevance to a hitting action. Given no frame variation in Image B, the bright color and relevant position logically persists.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    }
