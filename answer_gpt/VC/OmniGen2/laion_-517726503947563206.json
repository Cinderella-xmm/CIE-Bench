    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the text \"Aurora\" visible on the side of the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object that resembles a ship on the water has been replaced by an architectural-like structure made of transparent, crystalline material. There is no ship in Image B, therefore no text labeled 'Aurora' can be observed on the side of a ship. This conclusion stems from visual inspection where no identifiable vessel exists in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the registration number \"QV-8880\" visible on the hull of the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Similar to the analysis in Q1, the edited image contains a crystalline structure in place of a ship. As Image B does not contain an identifiable ship, no registration numbers such as 'QV-8880' are visible on any hull, reinforcing the conclusion based on the absence of a ship.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is a red flag visible at the top of the shipâ€™s mast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B indicates there is no ship, and hence, no masts or red flags related to ships are present. This deduction stems from the evident lack of any traditional ship components such as masts with flags atop, in the crystal structure.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the ship oriented in a side profile view, facing toward the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there is no traditional ship profile, as it features a crystalline structure instead. This structure doesn't have an orientation consistent with a side profile view of a vessel, affirming the response due to the dissimilar replacement of the ship.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the ship depicted as floating on a body of water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B shows the crystalline structure atop a water body, the lack of identifiable ship components confirms that a ship is absent. Thus, no vessel is depicted floating. Visual cues of glass-like architecture rather than traditional maritime vessel parts validate this.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the ship positioned near the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B involves a crystalline architectural structure centered in a body of water, but not an actual ship. Since the structure effectively occupies central positioning, the image does not contain a ship in this location, which in prior context was centered. The conclusion bases itself on acknowledging the absence of a ship.",
