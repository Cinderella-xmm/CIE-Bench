    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the vessel positioned in the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vessel, which appears to be a decorative lamp, is centrally positioned within the composition. The tip of the lamp aligns with the vertical midpoint of the image, indicating that the designer intended it to be the focal point.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a circular tray directly beneath the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the lamp resting on an ornate circular base adorned with circular gemstones. This base functions similarly to a tray but is more ornate and jewel-like than a simple serving tray.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does vapor or smoke originate from the top opening of the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible vapor or smoke feature emanating from the top of the lamp, resembling stylized magic smoke often depicted in fantasy settings.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the vessel have a conical or upward-tapering shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vessel in Image B is not conical or upward-tapering at all. Instead, it has a rounded, bulbous shape typical of a genie lamp, with a narrow top and a wider middle and base.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the vessel placed on a flat, patterned fabric surface that covers the visible ground plane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vessel is placed on a smooth, solid-colored surface, not a patterned fabric. The base of the lamp is surrounded by patterned designs, but these are not on a fabric.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a small opening at the top of the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lamp in Image B has a top structure but no visible small opening that distinguishes it from the body of the lamp. The top appears decorative and does not suggest a functional opening.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the tray made of a material visually similar to the vessel (e.g., terracotta)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base looks ornate and jeweled, much like the lamp itself, suggesting similarity visually in terms of lavish styling and decorative design rather than a simple terracotta appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Does the fabric beneath the vessel display a structured geometric pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no patterned fabric beneath the lamp in Image B; the surface is plain and solid. Any visible patterning comes from the jeweled base and lamp itself, not the surface below.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
