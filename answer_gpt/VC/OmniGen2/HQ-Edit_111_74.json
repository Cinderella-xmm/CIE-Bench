      "question": "Is the floral embroidery on the kimono located along the sleeve and lower back in the same pattern layout as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral embroidery on the kimono is visible with gold and red flowers, primarily located on the sleeves and body of the kimono. Comparing to Image A, which features white floral patterns on the backside and sleeves in a more detailed design, Image B has a different pattern layout. The embroidery in Image B has larger floral designs and appears less dense. This suggests a different pattern layout compared to Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the white fur collar visible at the neckline of the kimono?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a white cloth collar at the neckline of the kimono, distinctively different from fur. In Image A, the white fur collar is clearly visible around the neck area. The absence of a similar white fur collar in Image B indicates a difference.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the green obi tied in a prominent bow at the back of the kimono?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green obi is tied at the front with no visible bow. In Image A, the obi is tied in a large and intricate bow at the back, apparent from its visually prominent size and placement. Hence, Image B does not feature a prominent bow tied at the back.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the woman’s mouth open in a broad smile showing her teeth and her eyes crinkled at the corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not provide visual information about the woman's facial expression due to the blurred face, but it appears to be a composed stance with no visible indications of a broad smile or crinkled eyes. In usual scenarios, crinkling of eyes would involve visible changes around the edges which are not detectable in this image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman has her hair adorned with colorful floral ornaments, but there is no high ponytail visible. Image A distinctly shows red floral ornaments at the base of a high ponytail. Thus, the setup in Image B does not match the description of red floral ornaments at a ponytail base.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is depicted facing forward, and her head does not appear to be turned to the right looking over her shoulder. Image A shows the woman’s body facing left, with head turned showing a pose over the shoulder. Thus, the pose in Image B does not match the described orientation from Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features bamboo stalks illustrated as part of the background design, surrounding the woman on both sides. These vertical bamboo stalks are a clear element in both images supporting an oriental aesthetic. This aligns with the description.",
