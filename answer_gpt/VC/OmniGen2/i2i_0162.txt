    "Question": "Q1: Does the mouse retain its brown, orange, and white fur pattern?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mouse is depicted with a cartoonish, simplified style rather than realistic fur. The fur pattern is primarily orange with some darker and lighter shades but does not closely align with the naturalistic brown, orange, and white pattern typically seen in real mice. The transformation into a cartoon style creates a more vibrant and exaggerated coloration, which deviates from natural patterns.",
