      "question": "Is the dragon-headed prow with detailed carvings and open jaws present at the front of the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the box art shows a Viking ship with a dragon-headed prow, a common design feature for Viking ships, which typically includes detailed carvings and open jaws to signify strength and intimidation. As Image B features a depiction of a Viking ship, it's reasonable to infer that these artistic elements are likely present as they are traditional Viking ship characteristics.",

      "question": "Is the dark red and black circular knotwork emblem centered on the beige sail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a box displaying a Viking ship, but the sail is depicted with less realistic detailing compared to the artistic style often used for historical ship representations. It lacks specifics about intricate designs like knotwork emblems. The style focuses more on creating an impression of the Viking ship rather than detailed historical accuracy, suggesting that such fine detail as a knotwork emblem may not be included.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are multiple circular shields with distinct symbols mounted along the side of the ship beneath the oars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For the Viking ship depicted on the box in Image B, shields are typical features mounted along the hull or sides of historical Viking ships for both defense and decoration. However, this boxed depiction seems simplified, prioritizing broader illustrative features over specific shield details or symbols.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there multiple oars extending outward from the hull, each connected to a small human-like figure representing a rower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the depiction of the ship on the box in Image B, it features several oars suggesting rowers' presence as common in Viking ship representations. However, due to the illustrative nature rather than a detailed model representation, human-like rowers are not individually depicted with such specific detailing as expected on a box cover.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hull consist of clearly defined horizontal wooden planks with visible grain and layered construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artistic representation of the Viking ship on the box prioritizes broad characteristics such as shape and overall aesthetics over minute details like grain texture. Box art typically doesn't capture such granular details as wood grain or layered construction, focusing more on the general structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The box depiction in Image B shows a Viking ship style with a central mast and a square sail, indicative of typical Viking ship construction. The mast and unfurled sail design match common representations of such ships, emphasizing their sailing mechanisms as integral components.",
