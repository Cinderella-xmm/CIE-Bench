      "question": "Does the edited image retain the green stem at the top of the orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the top of the orange, there is still a noticeable green part which resembles the stem found on real oranges. This indicates that the green stem feature has been retained in the edited image to keep it looking similar to a real orange.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glossy texture of the orange still present on the keychain model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the surface of the orange shows a shiny, reflective appearance, which is characteristic of a glossy texture. This suggests the glossiness observed in genuine oranges is preserved in the edited version of the keychain model.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the keychain primarily colored in an orange hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the keychain model predominantly in an orange color, matching the natural color of a typical orange fruit. This observation confirms that the keychain maintains the orange hue akin to what would be expected from an actual orange.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the surface imperfections and texture patterns of the orange persist on the keychain model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, close inspection of the orange reveals the presence of natural texture and patterning that simulates the irregularities one would find on actual orange fruit surfaces. These details suggest that surface imperfections and texture patterns have been maintained in the edited image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the keychain maintain a proportional size and shape relative to the plate it rests on?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When analyzed independently, Image B does not show the orange resting on a plate as it is depicted in Image A. Without a reference to a plate in the edited image, the proportion in relation to a plate cannot be evaluated.",
      "weight": 2,
