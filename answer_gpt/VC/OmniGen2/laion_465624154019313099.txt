{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the cross-section showing a golden sponge base, white cream layer, and deep red jam layer visible?",

    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q9: Is the white cream layer visible between the sponge and jam layers?",

}

{
    "Question": "Q10: Is the golden sponge base layer visible in the cross-section?",
    "explanation": "The depiction in Image B of the cake does not include a visible cross-section, hence a golden sponge base layer cannot be identified.",
