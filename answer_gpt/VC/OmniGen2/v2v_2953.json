      "question": "Is the glass still recognizable as a standard cocktail glass with a cylindrical shape and a flat base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass is depicted with a cylindrical shape and a flat base, which matches the common forms of a standard cocktail glass. The color and light reflections on the surface contribute to this identification, as these features are typical of cocktail glasses used in bars.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible ice cubes in the glass, maintaining the appearance of a chilled beverage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the glass contains objects within it that resemble cubes but appear unreal, and these don't convincingly depict ice cubes. Typically, ice cubes would have a transparent or semi-transparent appearance indicating a frozen state; however, here, they appear solid and opaque like orange cheese cubes.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a slice of lime garnishing the rim of the glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, there is an object attached to the rim of the glass that is green and cut in a manner resembling citrus fruits. From a common understanding, limes are green when sliced similarly, and this item closely resembles a lime slice used as garnish.",

      "question": "Is there a metallic straw inserted into the cocktail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the straw within the glass is white and lacks metallic characteristics. Metallic straws typically have a silver or shiny appearance, but in this image, it seems to be made from plastic or another material that does not reflect like metal.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface beneath the glass exhibits a smooth texture with a reddish-brown tone consistent with polished wood. The reflections and color depict a wooden tabletop often found in bar environments, suggesting a polished wooden texture.",
