    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the pointed Gothic arches clearly visible within the stone towers of the bridge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bridge structure appears different due to the massive statue-like figure that has replaced the stone towers. The typical Gothic arches are not visible as this figure occupies the space, obscuring the original bridge architecture. This indicates any distinct Gothic features are not present in the edited image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the American flag still present on top of the left tower of the bridge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a large statue occupies the position where the bridge towers and the associated American flag would have been. This change results in the absence of any such flag being visible; hence, the American flag is not present in the edited structure.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the bridge tower retain its original light gray sandstone texture with visible block patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a large statue with a smooth, armored surface rather than the original bridge tower's light gray sandstone and block patterns. The texture is more akin to a sculpture or art installation than traditional stone architecture.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the Freedom Tower positioned behind and slightly to the right of the bridgeâ€™s central axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the large statue is positioned in front of the bridge. Despite this alteration, the Freedom Tower is still visible in the background, maintaining a relative position slightly to the right of the statue along the central axis, much like its position in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a reflective surface of water directly beneath the bridge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there appears to be a reflective water surface beneath the bridge. This suggests the natural river or waterway remains in place even with the monumental addition, contributing to the scenery and providing a reflective base for the structure above.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the clouds in the sky distributed in a partly cloudy pattern with soft blue and white tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is depicted with clear blues and no visible clouds. This contrasts with the partly cloudy sky described in Image A, indicating the absence of cloud formations in the edited environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the surrounding skyscrapers retain visible grid patterns of windows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surrounding skyscrapers in the distance appear to maintain their original architectural features, including the grid patterns of windows typical of urban skyscrapers. These structures do not appear altered and retain their characteristic design elements.",
