      "question": "Is there a female figure wearing a full-length kimono with a long trailing sleeve and wide hem?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the female figure is depicted wearing a traditional Japanese kimono which is characterized by its full-length design, long trailing sleeves, and wide hem.

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the figure positioned with her body angled to the right and her head turned back toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the female figure is illustrated standing with her body slightly facing forward, not particularly angled to the right, and while she is in profile, her head is not turned back toward the viewer. The posture suggests a more straightforward pose rather than a dynamic one where the head is turned back.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a path bordered by evenly spaced cylindrical posts on each side. However, the path appears to be a stylized flat surface typical in traditional Japanese woodblock prints rather than detailed stone paving. This artistic representation may depict paths in a simplified, uniform manner without explicit contours.",

      "choices": [

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, cherry blossom trees are illustrated with their branches spreading overhead, creating an impression of an arching canopy. The blossoms are depicted with a vibrant shade, highlighting the full bloom characteristic of cherry blossoms, often associated with spring scenery in Japan.",

      "choices": [

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays cherry blossoms on trees and lacks specific representation of scattered petals along the path or surrounding areas. The artwork focuses more on the blooms themselves rather than depicting fallen petals explicitly.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a path that leads towards a horizon without particular indications of a misty or glowing distance. The scene is portrayed in a stylized way which does not incorporate visual effects like mist or glow found in realistic images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
