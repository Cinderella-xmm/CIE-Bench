      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fireplace is clearly situated in the center of the wall within the composition of the room. This is inferred from its symmetrical alignment between the bookshelves, as well as the equal spacing of the light fixtures flanking it. Central placement is common in room designs to create a focal point, especially in a cozy, library-like setting.",
