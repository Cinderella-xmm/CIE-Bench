    "Question": "Q1: Is the subject standing in profile, facing right, with the violin resting under her chin and the bow actively drawn across the strings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is facing left with the outline of the violin visible including the scroll at the top, which is a feature identified by examining the bow position relative to the chin. Combining this observation with common knowledge that playing the violin typically involves holding it under the chin with the bow drawn across the strings at an angle, it suggests the subject is not in a full profile facing right.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the violin have two f-holes, a curved body, a neck, and a scroll at the top?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the violin shows a typical structure with the neck leading to the scroll at the top, and the body appears curved. The presence of f-holes, characteristic of violins, can be inferred even if not all details are perfectly visible due to artistic rendering. Drawing from common knowledge, these elements are traditional aspects of a violin.",
