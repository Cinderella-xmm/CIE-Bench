      "question": "Does the zebra retain its black-and-white stripe pattern without significant alteration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's black-and-white stripe pattern is clearly visible and consistent across its body, similar to what is known for zebras in general. There is no visible alteration to the pattern's design or color, maintaining the traditional appearance of a zebra.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra appears to be standing with its body oriented towards the right side of the frame, similar to a common standing posture for zebras when grazing or observing their surroundings. This position has not been significantly altered from a natural presentation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a second zebra whose body is partially visible behind the first zebra. This indicates that the original placement of the zebras within the frame, where one is slightly obscured by the other, has been preserved.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a background that, while in black and white, appears to consist of a flat terrain with textures resembling grass. There are trees and darker shapes in the distance that suggest vegetation. Despite the color change, the savannah setting and scattered vegetation are recognizable.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sizes and proportions of the zebras appear consistent with each other and with natural zebra sizes. There is no visible distortion in the perspectives, indicating that their relative sizes and proportions, as well as their placement in the frame, remain faithful to an authentic presentation.",
