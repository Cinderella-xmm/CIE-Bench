      "question": "Is the vertical facial split between black and white fur still present, dividing the face precisely down the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear distinction between the black and white portions of the dog's face, creating a split down the center. This characteristic is similar to what might be observed in chibi or stylized depictions of animals, where a clear division between two contrasting colors is often a stylized artistic choice. The central division of colors reflects typical characteristics and coherence in cartoon styles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both eyes large, round, and positioned symmetrically on either side of the facial split, with visible highlights reflecting light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is depicted with large, round eyes that are positioned on either side of the facial split. The eyes have visible highlights, which suggest a reflective surface characteristic common to cartoon and chibi styles. This symmetry and presence of highlights are typical in this type of artwork to express liveliness and cuteness.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the dog in an upright sitting position with both front paws flat on the ground and hind legs tucked beneath the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is portrayed in a sitting position, typical of small figurine or statuette designs, with front paws seemingly placed on a wooden base and the body in a way that suggests the hind legs are tucked beneath. The standard sitting posture is usually associated with docility and balance which is consistent with the depiction.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both ears pointed upward, erect, and symmetrical, with visible pink inner surfaces and dark outer edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction shows ears that are pointed upward and symmetrical, which is a common feature in stylized animal artwork to emphasize alertness and cuteness. However, while they have dark outer edges, the inner surfaces do not appear to be visibly pink but rather match the rest of the dog’s color. This deviation is a stylistic choice in this particular rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the black nose centered on the white muzzle, with visible whisker lines extending from the sides of the snout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog’s black nose is prominently centered on its white muzzle, which is a typical representation in stylized designs for clarity and focus. However, there are no visible whisker lines extending from the sides of the snout in the cartoon-like representation, which simplifies certain realistic features for design purposes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a collar visible around the dog’s neck with at least one tag hanging from it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a collar is clearly visible around the dog’s neck, and there is a tag hanging from it. This kind of accessory is frequently used in animal designs as a means of adding detail and personality. The presence and design of the collar can indicate domestication and is commonly used in depictions of pets.",
