      "question": "Is the ornate bow featuring symmetrical scrollwork and multiple spherical finials present and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornate bow at the top of the key features elaborate scrollwork and spherical finials integrated into the design. The bow appears well-crafted and retains decorative elements such as round finials symmetrically distributed. Applying world knowledge, ornate designs typically involve such scrollwork patterns with symmetrical finials to enhance aesthetic appeal, thus aligning with commonly seen ornate keys. Since Image A also exhibits this detailed and symmetrical scroll pattern, comparing both images reveals that the ornate bow in Image B is present and unchanged from the original.",

      "question": "Is the double-notched bit at the end of the key preserved in its original H-shaped configuration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bit of the key exhibits a double-notch structure forming an H shape, indicative of a traditional key with symmetrical teeth used to align within specific locking mechanisms. Comparing with Image A, we notice that both images display the key's bit in the exact H-shaped configuration with no alterations. Understanding common key designs, the double-notch aligns with standard mechanical configurations, showing preservation of this feature.",

      "question": "Are the textured bands along the shaft preserved in their original placement and form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The key shaft in Image B contains textured bands near the bow, adding grip and aesthetic detail, typically found in antique keys for style and usability. Viewing Image A, those same textured bands are present in identical placement and form. Common sense acknowledges that textured bands should be regularly spaced for structural integrity and enhancement, indicating proper preservation in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the key rendered in the original aged golden brass tone with visible highlights and shadows indicating metallic texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the key in a golden brass tone, revealing highlights and shadows which communicate a metallic texture. Antique keys often showcase a patinated surface, preserved in Image B with intentional rendering that conveys depth and age through lighting effects. Image A also shows this aged appearance and consistent texture use, revealing no changes upon comparison and analysis based on standard metallic portrayal.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the spherical finials positioned symmetrically around the scrollwork in the bow as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scrollwork embedded in the bow includes spherical finials in a balanced arrangement around the central design, a feature frequently observed in decorative objects for visual harmony. Image A's bow similarly demonstrates symmetry in finial placement around identical scrollwork. Recognizing typical ornate design elements, the finials around the scrollwork show unchanged positioning when compared, supporting preservation in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the key proportionally accurate, with the bow, shaft, and bit maintaining their original relative dimensions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the key's proportional attributes by maintaining a balanced ratio among the bow's decorative elements, the shaft's length, and the bit's size. Referencing Image A, the dimensions and proportions such as the relationship between different parts of the key remain constant across both images. With world knowledge on design accuracy, an antique key such as this should preserve proportional harmony, indicating stability in key design structures upon comparison.",
