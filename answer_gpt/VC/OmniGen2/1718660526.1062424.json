      "question": "Are the black stripes evenly distributed across the body, head, and legs in the same pattern as the original knitted animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture has orange and black stripes with a glossy tiled appearance, creating a more geometric pattern, but still with even distribution across the body, head, and legs. In Image A, the knitted animal also has evenly distributed stripes, but the texture is different due to the knitted fabric. The pattern of stripes in the edited sculpture remains consistent in distribution across the body, head, and legs, similar to the original, but differs in the material and presentation.",

      "question": "Is the snout present with two clearly defined, dark circular nostrils positioned symmetrically on the upper portion of the snout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture's snout features two dark shapes that represent nostrils. These are visibly marked and are positioned symmetrically. In Image A, the knitted animal also has identical dark circles indicative of nostrils, enhancing the characteristic features of the animal. The edited image preserves this aspect.",

      "question": "Are the eyes large, round, and positioned symmetrically on the face, each consisting of a white outer ring and a central black pupil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows eyes that are large and round, with a distinct white outer ring and a central black pupil. They are symmetrically positioned on the face. Image A maintains this eye design with similar symmetry and style, even though the medium differs. The characteristics of the eyes have been faithfully reproduced in the edited sculpture.",

      "question": "Is the mouth a clearly visible curved line forming a smile below the snout, consistent with the original animalâ€™s expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mouth is a clearly defined curved line that forms a smile below the snout. This is consistent with the expression seen in Image A, where the knitted animal also shows a curved line forming a smile. The smiling expression in the edited image mirrors the charm of the original.",

      "question": "Is the animal in a walking pose with the left front leg extended forward and the right front leg grounded behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture depicts the animal with its left front leg extended forward and the right front leg positioned slightly behind it, indicating a walking pose. Image A similarly illustrates the knitted animal in a walking position, suggesting motion by having opposing legs forward and back.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays two small, rounded ears placed symmetrically on the top of the sculpture's head, each slightly pointing outward. These ears, replicated from Image A, preserve the visual balance and style characteristic of the animal's design.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture is shown on a surface that appears granular and somewhat uneven, similar to that of natural sand. Image A features a background that also resembles a sandy, beach setting. The texture and presentation of the surface in the edited image is consistent with the natural appearance of sand.",
