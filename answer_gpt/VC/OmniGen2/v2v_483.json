      "question": "Is there a handheld fan with a circular blade structure being held in the manâ€™s right hand, directed toward the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the man is holding a handheld fan with a circular blade structure in his right hand. This is visually confirmed by the fan's typical design and how it is depicted being held and directed toward the adjacent area which includes candles, although the direct action towards the cake isn't clear from the fan's direction due to being a card illustration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there exactly seven candles on the cake, with visible flames and smoke rising from them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the scene is represented as an illustration depicting a card profile, rather than a realistic interaction with the cake. The visible candles with flames and smoke from the original do not strongly translate in the illustrated card depiction. The card aims for a symbolic representation and does not show specific candle count or smoke conspicuously.",

    {

      "question": "Is there visible smoke rising from the candles on the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B), as an illustrated card style representation, does not distinctly exhibit smoke rising from candles which would be visible in a realistic image. The focus in the illustration shifts towards character traits and theme branding rather than natural realism including smoke visualization.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the man leaning forward with his mouth puckered as if blowing air toward the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is illustrated rather than realistically photographed as in Image A. The card style does not depict the specific body gesture or facial expression associated with puckering for blowing; instead, he is sitting, holding the fan, reflecting a different sort of symbolism and gesture than the original interaction shown in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the cake placed on a white plate, which is on a wooden surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B creatively shows traits and environment settings without direct equivalence to realistic photography including surface placement and visual cue transition. The surroundings in animated card style do not faithfully replicate the original setup including specific dish and surface details seen in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the handheld fan positioned so that its airflow is directed toward the candles on the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fan's position in Image B, represented in the illustrated card, reinforces conceptual attributes rather than interactively lining up for directional airflow to the candle specifically as in Image A. The card aesthetic tends to deviate from action precision for personality and narrative illustration.",
