      "question": "Does the image retain the \"Twins\" text on the baseball uniforms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is a text 'TWINS' visible on the chibi figures' baseball uniforms. This indicates that the edited image has retained the same team branding as was presumably present in the original image. Recognition of the word suggests it hasn't changed or been removed in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figures are wearing black helmets that feature a red 'C'. This is a clear visual cue that these helmets are part of their attire and have been maintained in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows each chibi character holding what appears to be baseball bats, recognizable by their shape and subtle wooden textures. This suggests that Image B retains the detail of baseball bats being held by the individuals.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, no central figure is specifically differentiated in terms of a blue jacket. Instead, all individuals are wearing uniforms. Therefore, this suggests that the specific detail of a blue jacket is not present.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given that the faces of the chibi figures in Image B are blurred, it is not possible to determine or describe their facial expressions. As such, it cannot be said that they exhibit cheerful expressions.",
