        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is seen wearing a blouse with visible sleeves that appear to be long as they fully cover her arms. The presence of an apron is also evident, as it is tied around the waist and drapes in front of her. Similar attire can be seen in traditional depictions of women doing household chores, suggesting that this is indeed the expected attire for such activities.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the washing machine does not appear to have a round wooden barrel but rather an elongated wooden bathtub.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is engaging with a tub-like structure, and while she is touching fabric, the structure is not a barrel but more of a bathtub shape. This indicates that she is not placing fabric into a wooden barrel.",
