    "Question": "Q1: Is the Eiffel Towerâ€™s full lattice structure, including its three-tiered arches and pointed spire, clearly visible and structurally accurate?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower is depicted as a simplified illustration located centrally in the background. Its depiction lacks detailed lattice structures compared to the realistic representation seen in Image A. The structural elements such as the three-tiered arches and the pointed spire are simplified into a recognizable, yet stylized outline suitable for graphic representation. Thus, while recognizable, the tower in Image B lacks the full structural accuracy characteristic of the real Eiffel Tower seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the hedges arranged in a straight line with consistent cubic shapes and even spacing along the left side of the pathway?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows hedges along the path, characterized by clear, geometric, and simplified shapes typical of graphic illustrations. These hedges are depicted as a continuous straight line with consistent cubic formations, which aligns with the characteristics of the stylized depiction in Image B. The illustration consistently portrays the hedges with even spacing, lending to the clarity and simplicity of the design. Image A also shows aligned hedges but in a more detailed and natural form.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the sun located in the upper-left portion of the sky with a clear starburst effect radiating outward?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sky does not feature a sun with a starburst effect, as the weather and lighting are depicted through the absent of specific sunlight illustrations, typical of a stylized graphical representation that matches its park etiquette theme and message.

    "Question": "Q5: Are black lampposts with traditional lanterns evenly spaced along both sides of the pathway?",
    "explanation": "Image B uses simplified graphic elements and does not include lampposts with lanterns along the pathway, focusing instead on a stylized park scene and signage aligned with Parisian park etiquette. Image A, however, depicts traditional black lampposts along the path with lantern features, characteristic of Parisian parks.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q6: Are there multiple individuals visible in the park, positioned naturally along the path and grassy areas, interacting with the environment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on park etiquettes and includes stylized graphical icons instead of individuals interacting within the environment. It uses simplified imagery to convey actions rather than depicting realistic human scenes, unlike Image A, where multiple individuals naturally interact along the paths and grassy areas in a lifelike depiction.",
    "answer": "No"
