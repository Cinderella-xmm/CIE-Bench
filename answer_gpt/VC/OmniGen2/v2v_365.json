    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the alternating tan and dark brown pattern on the turtle's shell?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi turtle character has a smooth, animated surface and lacks the specific tan and dark brown patterning seen in real turtle shells, like the one in Image A. The shell in Image B is more stylized and does not exhibit this natural color pattern.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the turtle's limb structure, even if the limbs are stylized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a chibi-style turtle character whose limbs are indeed stylized but still resemble those of a turtle, with visible digits and a similar positioning to a turtle's limbs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the textured appearance of the turtle's shell?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shell in Image B is smooth and cleanly animated, lacking the textured, natural appearance found in Image A's real turtle. Instead of texture, it has a simplified design typical of animated characters.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a turtle character with an animated head featuring visible eyes that are reminiscent of those traditionally found on turtles. While the style is more cartoonish, the basic structure of the head and eyes is maintained.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The limbs in Image B are smooth and stylized without the textured appearance evident in Image A's real turtle. The simplification in detail aligns with the artistic approach of animated designs.",
