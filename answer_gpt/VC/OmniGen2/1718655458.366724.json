      "question": "Is the flowing brown and gray marbled pattern visible on the surfaces of the LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks are explicitly visible and have a uniform blue color, without any brown or gray marbled patterns on them. World knowledge tells us that a marbled pattern should show some mixed colors or streaks, resembling natural marble. Since the LEGO bricks are completely blue and show no marbling, the flowing brown and gray patterns are absent.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the LEGO bricks rendered with a white base color accented by warm brown and gray marbling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks are shown as having a blue color. World knowledge on color informs us that a white base with warm brown and gray marbling would show distinct multi-color streaks or patterns typical of marble. Since the bricks are blue, they cannot be described as having a white base with brown and gray marbling.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the marbled veins follow an organic, irregular flow rather than a geometric or repetitive pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows no marbled pattern on the LEGO bricks to analyze. Marbled veins, when present, typically follow an organic flow without strict regularity, unlike geometric patterns. The absence of any marbled design on the LEGO bricks in Image B eliminates the possibility of observing their flow pattern.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both warm brown and gray veins present together in the marbled pattern of the LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image Bâ€™s LEGO bricks are monochromatic blue, lacking any visible marbled pattern. Normally, a marbled pattern with warm brown and gray would display mixed colors, resembling the surface of natural marble. Since the edited image shows blue bricks with no color variations, both warm brown and gray veins are not present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the LEGO bricks visually appear to be made of a marble-like material based on their surface pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains LEGO bricks that are uniformly blue with no marbling effect. Typically, a marble-like material would feature swirling or variegated patterns. With the lack of any such visual detail, the bricks appear to be made of a standard plastic material rather than a marble-like one.",
