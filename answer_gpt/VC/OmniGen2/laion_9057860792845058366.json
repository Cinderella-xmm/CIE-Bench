      "question": "Are the two orange horn-like protrusions on the top of the robot's head present and unchanged in shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot features two orange horn-like protrusions on its head, resembling antennae or decorative elements. Based on their visual appearance, they are consistently shaped and positioned symmetrically on top of the head. Comparing with Image A, these protrusions are visible and appear to be unchanged in both shape and position, indicating that this feature has been preserved.",

      "question": "Is the large red rectangular plate on the robot's chest intact, maintaining its original size, shape, and placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's chest features a prominent red rectangular plate, maintaining its size, shape, and central placement as a distinct chest emblem. This serves as an identifying characteristic of the robot's design. A comparison with Image A confirms that this red plate remains intact, indicating no alteration in size or position.",

      "question": "Are the red knee pads present on both legs, positioned at the joint area and matching the original shape and color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's knees bear colored accent pieces. However, these are blue instead of red, and therefore the original color has not been maintained. Additionally, while they are positioned at the joint area, they do not match the original red knee pad design seen in Image A, indicating a change in color.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the hands of the robot fully black, with a claw-like or articulated finger design, and positioned as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's hands are depicted as black, with a design that suggests articulated fingers or a claw-like appearance. They are positioned similarly to Image A, maintaining the design's integrity and positioning.",

      "question": "Do the robot’s feet maintain their angular, blocky shape with black toe segments and red accent plates near the ankles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's feet retain an angular, blocky design with black segments at the toes. However, the accent plates near the ankles are blue instead of the original red seen in Image A, indicating a change in color while the shape remains consistent.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the robot in the same dynamic standing pose, with the left arm slightly raised and the body angled toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot is depicted in a dynamic stance similar to that in Image A, with its left arm slightly elevated and the body facing forward. This consistent pose emphasizes the robot's readiness and agility, maintained across both images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the primary colors of the robot—white, gray, red, and orange—preserved in their original distribution and intensity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the basic structure remains, the color scheme differs from Image A. The primary colors of blue and white have replaced the gray and some red accents, altering the overall color distribution and intensity. Orange remains in the horns, but its presence is more subtle compared to Image A.",
