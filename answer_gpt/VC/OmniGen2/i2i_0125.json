        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apples appear vividly colored with various shades of red. They also have noticeable white speckles distributed across their surface.

      "question": "Are the apples shown with a smooth, shiny texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the apples appearing smooth and shiny, suggesting that a gloss effect is present to enhance their visual appeal. This characteristic aligns with the general perception of well-maintained apples that have a polished surface, reflecting light efficiently. In Image A, the apples similarly exhibit a shiny appearance, indicating that Image B retains this element.",

      "question": "Is natural light visible, creating realistic reflections on the apple surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there appears to be distinct highlights and reflections on the apples indicative of natural light sources, such as sunlight coming from the window at the side of the apples. These reflections contribute to the realistic portrayal of the apples’ surfaces. Image A also shows this natural lighting effect, reinforcing its realistic visual representation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the apples seemingly placed on a flat surface with a plain white background, which lacks the visible wooden texture noticeable in Image A. In Image A, the table's wooden texture serves as a distinct visual element enhancing the setting's rustic quality, which is not retained in Image B’s layout.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a plain white background with no visible greenery or blurred background, aiming for a cleaner and more straightforward visual presentation. In Image A, however, the background is softly blurred, offering hints of natural greenery, creating a contextual and warm environment. Image B lacks these elements.",
