      "question": "Is the cat’s fur predominantly orange with white markings on the chest, chin, and muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual information in Image B, the cat's fur is depicted with a vibrant orange color, which is prominent throughout the majority of its body. The chest, chin, and muzzle feature distinct white markings that characteristically contrast with the orange fur, illustrating common coloration patterns found in cats. This combination of orange and white is typical for certain cat breeds.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the cat sitting upright with its head tilted upward, gazing toward the sky through the window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is positioned in an upright sitting posture, with its head slightly angled upwards, seemingly looking through the window in the direction towards the sky. The orientation and tilt of the cat's head suggest a gaze that extends upward, consistent with a scenario where it would be observing something, possibly outside the window or the sky.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the window consist of six rectangular panes arranged in a 2x3 grid with white frames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The window visible in Image B is part of the scene with the cat. However, this image does not provide a clear view of the window's pane arrangement as there is only a portion of the window visible, making the specific 2x3 grid configuration hard to ascertain from the available visual cues.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sky visible through the window a solid, clear blue without significant cloud cover?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The region through the window in Image B shows the sky in a visually clear and uniform blue hue, typical of clear weather conditions without prominent cloud formations. The absence of significant cloud cover can be inferred from the visible portion, suggesting an uncluttered, clear blue sky.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a cream-colored sheer curtain partially drawn back on the right side of the window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a part of the window where a curtain is present, but it is described within a card border, limiting the details about curtains. Therefore, without seeing a clear cream-colored sheer curtain drawn back, it's difficult to claim such specific characteristics based solely on Image B. Details on the right side related to curtains aren't evident.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the cat’s tail thick, fluffy, and curled around its body in a relaxed manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat’s tail exhibits a substantial, fluffy appearance indicative of dense, plush fur. The tail is visually curled around the cat's body, which is a typical relaxed posture for cats when they are sitting comfortably.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the cat sitting on a dark brown wooden floor with visible planks and natural wood grain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cat sitting within a card frame. There's no detailed depiction of the floor under the cat visible inside the frame as the background primarily focuses on the window and sky, thus making a judgment about dark brown wooden flooring challenging based solely on this visual.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Do the cat’s eyes appear large, round, and golden-brown with clear reflections indicating light source from the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cat in Image B has noticeably large and round eyes, similar to typical characteristics often observed in cartoon or idealized cat depictions. The eyes have a rich golden-brown color and the presence of reflections suggests they are catching light from a source on the right, creating a vivid, life-like appearance, consistent with typical lighting dynamics.",
