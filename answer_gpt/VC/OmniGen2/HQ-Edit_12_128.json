    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the clock face circular and positioned in the center of the wooden frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face is circular and is centrally positioned within the wooden frame. Recognizing the symmetrical design of traditional clocks combined with the central positioning of the clock face using visual cues and spatial understanding leads to this conclusion.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the Roman numerals arranged in clockwise order from I to XII around the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Roman numerals are arranged in a standard manner, following a clockwise order from I to XII, typical of analog clocks. This is confirmed by visual inspection and knowledge of traditional clock designs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the pendulum hang directly below the clock face, supported by two vertical rods?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pendulum hangs directly below the clock face but is not supported by vertical rods. Instead, it appears to be suspended by a single chain. This conclusion is drawn from observing the structure and understanding pendulum designs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there two fluted columns, one on each side of the clock face, extending from the top to the bottom of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two columns, one on each side of the clock face, but they do not extend from the top to the bottom of the frame as they start below the decorative top and end above the bottom.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a decorative crest with leaf-like carvings located at the top center of the clock frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the top center of the clock frame, there is a decorative crest that features leaf-like carvings. This design element is typical in ornate clock decorations, and its placement and design can be easily identified visually.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a circular medallion located at the center of the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face does not feature a circular medallion at its center; instead, the center is clear as typical for displaying the clock hands. The design elements are around the perimeter and in the structure, not central to the clock face.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two small rounded feet extend downward from the bottom corners of the clock frame, designed to give additional ornamental detail and structural aesthetics typical in such clock designs.",
