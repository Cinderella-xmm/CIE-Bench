      "question": "Is the dark polished wooden casing of the grandfather clock present with its original shape, carvings, and finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design elements center around a book cover titled 'Secrets of Time'. The focus is on a book with decorative elements and text. There is no depiction of a grandfather clock's casing with its original shape, carvings, and finish in the image, as it features a different design concept entirely.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glass panel of the clock clearly visible, showing the pendulum and weights inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a book cover design, and its decorative clock illustration serves as an embellishment rather than a functional clock. There is no visible glass panel showing pendulum and weights inside as the clock design is illustrative and mainly decorative.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the carved base of the clock present with the circular medallion at its center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a clock illustration as part of a book cover design. This image includes an artistically stylized clock, but lacks detailed features such as a carved base with a circular medallion at the center, which is a realistic feature of grandfather clocks and not typically depicted in this manner on book covers.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the red Persian-style rug with a central medallion and geometric border fully visible on the floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a book cover that does not depict a room interior, and thus lacks elements such as a floor or a red Persian-style rug with a medallion design. Such elements are room furnishings not relevant to the design of a book cover.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, being a book cover, focuses primarily on the text and decorative elements related to clock motifs and literature, without depicting a room setting or furniture elements like a green tufted velvet armchair.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is centered around the theme of time featuring a book, and does not represent the interior architectural elements of a room such as a fireplace mantel or iron grate. These elements from room decor are absent in a book cover design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The contents of Image B focus on an artistic book cover with themes related to time and lacks representation of architectural features like a window, drapes, or radiator fins, which are not typically included on a book cover.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a book cover concept replaces the intricate details of a room setting, such as small decorative items like a brass scale or tea kettle near a fireplace. These items are room-specific and not relevant to the book cover's theme.",
