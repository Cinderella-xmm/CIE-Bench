    "Question": "Q1: Is the orange circular lifebuoy still present and clearly visible in the same position near the netting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there's a notable figure obstructing the spot where the lifebuoy was visible in Image A. Given the large size of this new object and its positioning right where the lifebuoy was, the lifebuoy is obscured. On the basis of visual information in Image B alone, the lifebuoy is not present.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the dark mesh netting still visible along the shoreline, connected by vertical poles?",
    "explanation": "Image B has been altered with an object obscuring much of the area where the netting is visible in Image A. While the poles may still be present, the new large figure covers parts of the shore area, thus hiding the netting.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the shoreline maintain its original diagonal slope from the bottom left to the top right of the frame?",
    "explanation": "Both images show the shoreline running diagonally from bottom left to top right. The presence of the new object in Image B does not change the underlying diagonal orientation of the shoreline.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the orange lifebuoy physically connected to one of the vertical poles of the netting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the new object obscures the area where the lifebuoy would typically appear to be connected to a pole in Image A. Without visible evidence of the lifebuoy being connected in the edited image, we cannot confirm a connection.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there visible white foam patterns in the water immediately adjacent to the shoreline?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, despite alterations, the water still shows white foam patterns similar to those seen in Image A. These patterns are visible and adjacent to the shoreline.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the sand along the shoreline still light beige in color, without significant discoloration or tinting?",
    "explanation": "In both images, the sand maintains a consistent light beige color. The alterations in Image B do not affect the color of the sand.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are at least three vertical poles visible along the netting, evenly spaced from the foreground to the background?",
    "explanation": "Image B has been altered with a large figure that covers or obstructs the view of some of the poles that were visible in Image A. In Image B, the visibility of the poles along the netting is reduced and uneven due to obstruction.",
    "answer": "No"
