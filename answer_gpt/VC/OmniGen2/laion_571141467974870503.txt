    "Question": "Q2: Does the train have two circular headlights below a central white circular light on its front?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the train includes design elements suggesting train features, but the illustration style is based on a simplified artistic depiction that does not clarify the arrangement of headlights with a central circular light. Without specific detailing, we cannot ascertain this exact configuration. Thus, the answer is No.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are there multiple vertical rows of white-framed windows on the side of the barn?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the barn is depicted through stylized color blocks and outlines without specific details like multiple vertical rows of white-framed windows. The artistic style focuses on the outline and colors, lacking such precise architectural details found in Image A. Therefore, the answer is No.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there two large wooden doors centered on the lower part of the barnâ€™s front facade?",
