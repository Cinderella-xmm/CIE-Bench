      "question": "Is the kayak still bright yellow in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kayak is depicted in a cartoonish style with a consistent bright yellow hue, similar to its depiction in a naturalistic sense in Image A. The use of vibrant yellow for objects like kayaks is common to enhance visibility on water and for aesthetic appeal, which remains consistent in various representations.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the black bungee cords in an X-pattern present on both ends of the kayak deck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the cartoon depiction of Image B, the design features tend to be simplified. The kayak does not prominently showcase detailed elements like bungee cords, which are common in realistic depictions like Image A for practical purposes (to hold gear). The absence of such detail implies a focus on the kayak's simplified form.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a black padded seat visible inside the kayak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the representation of the kayak is minimalistic, with no apparent depiction of detailed interior elements like a black padded seat. Such intricate details are often omitted in cartoon-style images to keep the focus on the overall object rather than interior specifics.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the skateboard have a dark gray grip tape surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain a skateboard; instead, it focuses on a kayak. Therefore, the question of the skateboard having a dark gray grip tape surface is irrelevant to this image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the skateboardâ€™s trucks silver and the wheels tan in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B illustrates a kayaking scene without any skateboard present, there is no visual information to analyze concerning the skateboard's trucks or wheel colors.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the kayak and skateboard aligned vertically and placed parallel to each other?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, only a kayak is depicted in an illustrative, cartoonish manner and no skateboard is present. Thus, the question of alignment with a skateboard is not applicable in this context.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the background a uniform neutral beige surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The setting in Image B is a vibrant outdoor scene with a lake and greenery, contrasted with the indoor-style setting of Image A with a neutral beige background. This indicates a distinct difference in environmental context between the two images.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Do both the kayak and skateboard cast soft shadows to their left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's visual setting indicates natural light conditions with the kayak shown on water, which does not show shadows on a hard surface as in Image A. Hence, there are no comparative shadows of the kayak or skateboard casting towards a specific direction.",
