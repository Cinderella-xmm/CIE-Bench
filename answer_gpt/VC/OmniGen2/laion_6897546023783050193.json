      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure does not have a beard, and the hair is not covered by a hooded garment. Instead, the figure's hair flows down naturally without any covering. This portrayal differs from traditional depictions of figures like Christ, who often have a beard and a hood or robe.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robe covers almost the entire body from the shoulders to the base. It features folds running down the front, although the depiction is slightly stylized compared to realistic drapery. The design choice maintains a sense of vertical flow, typical of traditional robes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the figure in a frontal pose, similar to how a statue might appear. However, unlike typical photographic views from low angles, the art style presents a leveled perspective without significant foreshortening or upward angle. This stylized depiction suggests a direct, evenly balanced viewpoint.",
