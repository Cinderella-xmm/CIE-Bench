      "question": "Does the image retain the white porcelain bowl with a blue floral design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a white porcelain bowl with a blue floral design is clearly visible. By observing the rim and the floral patterns inside the bowl, it can be determined that the bowl has not changed in design. These visual cues suggest that the element has been retained from Image A, as the floral design and the white color of the bowl remain consistent.",

      "question": "Is the orange curry sauce still visible, coating the transformed elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a shiny orange substance that can be presumed to be sauce since it is coating the elements placed in the bowl, such as the dragon eggs and dragons. This is similar to how curry sauce might appear when covering ingredients in a dish. Without direct visual comparison to Image A, common sense and the visual appearance of the sauce indicate its continued presence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the transformed elements (dragon eggs and dragons) arranged within the bowl in a manner consistent with the original dish's placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed elements (dragon eggs and dragon figures) are arranged concentrically around the coriander garnish in the bowl, as would typically be done with the original dish elements to present them neatly within the bowl. However, the inclusion of dragons changes the arrangement style significantly from usual food presentation. Thus, while they fill the bowl, their placement is more fantastical than a traditional dish might be.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the area surrounding the bowl still shows a kitchen-like setting with some containers in the background, which is similar to a kitchen countertop. This suggests that the original setting, a kitchen counter, has been retained from Image A.",

      "question": "Does the orange curry sauce retain its glossy texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orange sauce appears shiny and reflective, indicating a similar glossy texture to what would typically be seen in a sauce. This visual property is consistent with what was likely present in Image A, indicating that the sauce's texture has been maintained.",
