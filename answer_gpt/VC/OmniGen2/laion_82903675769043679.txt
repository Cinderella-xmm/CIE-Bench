    "Question": "Q1: Is the curved contour of the fairway, leading from the foreground toward the green, preserved in its original shape?",
    "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the fairway's curved shape leading toward the green in the background appears consistent. The gradual curve is typical of golf course designs to challenge players. Observing the edited image confirms that the fairway's shape remains unchanged, maintaining its original contour. Since the question requires comparison, analysis of Image A verifies the fairway's contour. Both images show the same fairway shape, indicating that the curved contour has been preserved.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the sand bunkers located in their original positions along the fairway, particularly near the green and on the left side?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sand bunkers are visible close to the green and left side of the fairway. These strategic placements are typical for challenging golfers with varied landscape features. Comparing with Image A, the bunkers are positioned similarly, providing evidence that their locations have not been altered in Image B.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the water hazard present in the foreground, directly bordering the fairway, and reflecting the sky and structures?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the presence of a water hazard near the foreground of the fairway, capturing reflections from the surrounding structures. This typical element of golf courses poses additional challenges for players. A comparison with Image A indicates that the water hazard remains unchanged, offering the same reflective feature and customary foreground positioning.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the AT&T GOLF tower and the white event tents located in the right midground, adjacent to the spectator area?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a tower labeled 'AT&T GOLF' and white event tents on the right midground near a dense crowd, suggesting organized events or tournaments. Common knowledge indicates such structures are used for events monitoring or hospitality. Comparison with Image A confirms their unchanged location alongside the crowd.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the green area elevated at the back, forming a slight incline from the fairway?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the green area appears elevated with a slight incline, typical for golf course designs to add variation and complexity in play. Observations align with the elevation evident in Image A, indicating a consistent incline preserved between the two images.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a dense group of spectators visible along the edge of the fairway, especially near the green?",
    "explanation": "Image B reveals a large gathering of spectators, primarily along the fairway edge approaching the green. Such crowds are common for significant golf events where viewership is high. Image A comparison shows similar crowd density and placement, confirming their presence in both images.",
    "answer": "Yes"
