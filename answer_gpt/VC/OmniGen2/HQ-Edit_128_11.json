      "question": "Is the black grand piano with an open lid and visible keyboard present in the center of the stage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a black grand piano depicted in the center with an open lid and visible keyboard. This is clearly illustrated in the design of the promotional poster, where the piano is prominently featured as a silhouette. The focus of the poster is on the piano, indicating its significance, suggesting that it occupies a central position on a stage, a common setup for concert events. In Image A, the piano is also centrally placed on the stage, opened, and with the keyboard visible.",

      "question": "Is the stage floor made of polished wood with visible reflections of the piano and ambient light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B represents a promotional poster where the stage floor's material and its reflective properties are not detailed, as the focus is on illustrating a concept rather than the exact materials used. In Image A, the stage floor is clearly polished wood, showing reflections of the piano and ambient light. The noticeable reflection provides a sense of elegance and formality typical in classical concert settings. Thus, in Image B, the absence of detailed depiction does not confirm the visible reflections.",

      "question": "Is the central dome ceiling featuring a painted fresco with floral motifs and a surrounding gilded border still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ceiling details are simplified into decorative elements for the poster, not explicitly showing any painted fresco or specific motifs like those found in Image A. Instead, the design centers around a general opulent framework, suggesting grandeur without explicit fresco details. Image A, however, vividly displays a ceiling with complex floral motifs and gilded borders. Therefore, these specific features from Image A do not directly appear in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the large chandelier suspended from the center of the ceiling, composed of multiple tiers of crystals and candle-like lights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chandelier depicted in the poster is prominently displayed at the top with distinct tiers and appears elaborate, suggesting multiple tiers of crystals and lights, similar to a typical grand chandelier in formal concert venues. This presentation implies a large chandelier, even though it lacks the intricate details visible in Image A. Image A indeed has a large chandelier with multiple tiers, aligning with the basic portrayal in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a conceptual representation of furnishings and audience arrangement around the stage area in a simplistic manner, using silhouettes to indicate the presence of audience seats in a curved, tiered setup typical in concert halls. While Image A displays this arrangement with detail, Image B portrays it symmetrically in its design to suggest this setup without explicit tiering details.",
