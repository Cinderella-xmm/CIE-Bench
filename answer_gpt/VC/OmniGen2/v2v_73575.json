      "question": "Is the image composed of two separate panels, with one bird on the left and one on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two birds placed on different chess pieces, but they are positioned within a single frame. There is no visible division such as a line separating two panels, which is typically required for two separate panels.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the bird that was originally on the left still located in the left panel, and the bird that was originally on the right still located in the right panel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the birds resemble origami sculptures and digital constructs, their alignment is similar to Image A, with the left bird resembling the original left bird, now stylized, and the right bird resembling the original right bird in digital form.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The left bird in Image B is stylized to have its head turned forward, resembling the original posture, but as an origami sculpture. While the beak is visible, it does not appear slightly open; thus, it deviates from a slight opening.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right bird angles such that its profile is visible, and it faces the left, consistent with the original posture in Image A.",
