      "question": "Is the rectangular grille located at the front center of the locomotive present in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, a rectangular grille is clearly visible at the front center of the locomotive. Analyzing Image A, the original image, it also shows a similar rectangular grille at the same location. This is a common feature for older locomotives, aiding in ventilation. The reasoning process involves observing the locomotive design and recognizing the grille as a functional part of many trains.",

      "question": "Is there a single illuminated orange-yellow headlight on the front of the locomotive in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, there is an illuminated orange-yellow headlight on the front of the locomotive, which looks typical for train designs to enhance visibility. Checking Image A, the original image of a train in a less colorful, realistic setting, there is also a single light visible at the front of the locomotive. Both images depict the light in a similar location and style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, metal handrails are evident on the front bumper of the locomotive, indicating safety features for maintenance personnel. Looking at Image A, the real-world context, similar metal handrails are present on the front bumper, consistent with the conventional design of locomotives used for safety.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, a circular object, likely representing a smoke stack or roof vent, is visible on the roof of the locomotive's cab. In Image A, the original photo, there is no noticeable circular object on the roof of the cab; instead, the roof is rather plain and unadorned.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a whimsical scenario where the train runs on a simple, single track, typical for illustrative landscapes. Conversely, Image A vividly depicts multiple intersecting railway tracks beneath the locomotive, highlighting the complexity and busyness of a rail yard environment.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited depiction, the landscape is idealized, devoid of any freight cars to maintain a clean visual. Image A, however, shows several wooden freight cars in the background, signaling a functional and industrial railway setting which is common in freight yards.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the environment is pristine and vegetation is present. In the original image (Image A), the ground around the tracks is indeed covered in mud and scattered debris, typical of a realistic, operational railway zone exposed to harsh weather and heavy use over time.",
