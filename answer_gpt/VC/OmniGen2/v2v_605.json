      "question": "Is the gorilla depicted with predominantly dark gray to black fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is a cartoonish or toy gorilla characterized by stylized features typical of such figures. Its fur appears to be a solid, dark color, likely interpreted as black due to the color choices often used in toys and cartoon imagery. The gorilla character is made to look friendly and simplified, not meant to represent realistic textures or colors of fur. Therefore, the fur is dark black in typical toy fashion.",

      "question": "Does the gorilla have dark, almost black skin on its face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla's face, especially around the eyes and the nose, is depicted with a dark coloration, consistent with the cartoon design commonly seen in toys and chibi figures. This is a stylized representation rather than a realistic depiction. The skin appears dark and blends with the fur color, typical of the character design. Therefore, we can conclude the skin appears to be dark in context.",

      "question": "Is the gorilla shown with a broad, muscular chest and visible pectoral definition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cartoon gorilla or a toy figure with simplified anatomy. It is more rounded and less defined compared to realistic depictions. Although the toy has a broad chest, the muscular definition typical of realistic anatomy is absent, replaced by a rounded and stylized form. Therefore, it is more abstract and playful without detailed musculature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a lighter-colored area on the gorilla’s back and shoulders, indicative of a silverback?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a toy gorilla with consistent, dark fur color throughout its body without variations that would indicate a silverback. Toys, especially character ones, often utilize uniform color schemes for simplicity and visual impact. There are no lighter patches shown on the gorilla’s back or shoulders in the toy depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The toy gorilla in Image B features simplistic facial characteristics typical of toy designs. The nose is basic and cartoonish, fitting the toy's style, with the absence of detailed anatomical features. It doesn't have prominent brow ridges as these aspects are typically minimized in cartoon characters to emphasize approachable, friendly designs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a toy gorilla with one hand holding a stick and the other extended beside its body, in a relaxed and playful pose typical of toy design, rather than a dominant or aggressive stance like a pounding of the chest. The pose fits the toy's intention to look approachable and not threatening.",
