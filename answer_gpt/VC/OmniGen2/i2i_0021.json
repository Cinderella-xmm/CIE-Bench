      "question": "Are the three sheep positioned near each other, with one adult sheep interacting closely with the two younger ones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the three chibi sheep are positioned closely together, standing side by side and leaning slightly towards each other as they touch a fence. This is similar to Image A where the sheep are also near each other, with one sheep interacting closely with the two others by touching the fence as well. The observation from the edited image indicates that the chibi sheep are indeed designed to be located close together.",

      "question": "Do the chibi sheep maintain their original postures, with the adult sheep standing upright and the younger ones leaning towards it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, all three chibi sheep are seen standing upright and wearing winter hats and scarves. These accessories and the upright posture signify a different scenario than in Image A, where the sheep are moments captured in casual stances with possible postural variances during their interaction. There is no distinction in posture that matches the presence of an adult sheep and younger ones leaning towards it. The chibi depiction aims for a uniform standing alignment without differentiation.",

      "question": "Do the chibi sheep retain identifiable sheep-like body proportions, such as a rounded body and small legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi sheep display characteristics typical of stylized sheep designs, with rounded bodies and smaller legs pronounced in comparison to their body size. Such proportions are consistent with the representation of sheep, even in cartoon depictions where these differences are exaggerated for effect. Whereas Image A shows true sheep proportions observed in nature, the chibi version underscores these attributes in a whimsical way.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible interaction displayed between the adult chibi sheep and the two younger ones, suggesting care or attention?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the three chibi sheep dressed warmly and standing together, but without specific interaction gestures that would suggest care or attention directly among them. They are depicted side-by-side without additional elements that imply a deeper interaction, unlike Image A where the sheepâ€™s postures and movements suggest possible interaction or attention as they gather at the fence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the chibi sheep retain a representation of their woolly texture, even in a stylized or simplified manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi sheep embody a typical cartoon design where woolly textures are implied through rounded and stylized fluffy body outlines. These textures in chibi or cartoon art hint at their real-life wool through simplified representations. Image A naturally shows the wool texture of the sheep which is captured photographically. Thus, the chibi rendering translates this texture through simplified visual cues.",
