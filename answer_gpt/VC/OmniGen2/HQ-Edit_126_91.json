      "question": "Is the curved side profile of the grand piano preserved, maintaining its characteristic gentle arc and elongated form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grand piano has a curved side profile, which is typically observed in grand pianos, maintaining its characteristic gentle arc and elongated form. This matches the conventional design of grand pianos. The gentle arc is essential for its acoustics and aesthetic appeal, a trait recognized from typical piano designs. Therefore, based on the visual attributes of Image B, the curved side profile is preserved.",

      "question": "Are the four tapered legs with decorative casters present and positioned beneath the piano body as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grand piano exhibits four tapered legs that end in decorative casters, positioned effectively beneath the body of the piano. This feature is crucial for grand piano mobility and stability. The presence of tapered legs with casters is consistent with traditional and modern grand piano designs, affirming their presence as a maintained attribute.",

      "question": "Is the piano positioned directly in the center of the corridor, aligned with the vanishing point created by the columns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the position in Image B, the piano is not directly in the center. Compared to Image A, where the piano is centrally aligned within a minimalist corridor setting, Image B shows the piano placed in a corridor with visible columns, suggesting a different spatial arrangement. The setting indicates the piano is positioned in a more decorated area and not strictly centered.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the floor composed of large square tiles arranged in a repeating pattern of alternating dark and light shades?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floor is composed of large square tiles, but they feature a marble-like pattern with muted shades rather than distinctly alternating dark and light shades. This is indicative of typical luxury interiors with marbled floors, diverging from a simplistic contrasting tile arrangement. Comparing this to Image A, where alternating shades were evident, confirms the change in pattern style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there tall, evenly spaced white columns extending along both sides of the corridor, forming a symmetrical passage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B offers a view of a richly decorated corridor with columns; however, these columns are not purely white or uniformly spaced as defined strictly by symmetry. The overall lavish setting with ornate decorations differs from the straightforward corridor with white columns in Image A, suggesting altered decorative elements and less emphasis on symmetry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the piano retain a highly reflective, glossy black surface that mirrors the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The piano in Image B features a glossy black surface, allowing for reflections of its surroundings, consistent with the design and material of grand pianos. This shiny finish is intentionally designed for aesthetic appeal, showcasing the piano in a well-lit, luxurious environment, similar to the original characteristics noted in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are soft shadows cast beneath the piano and along the floor, consistent with overhead lighting from above?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, soft shadows are visible around the piano, particularly beneath its body and along the floor. Such shadows typically arise from overhead lighting, reflecting the placement and light dissemination commonly used in interior settings. These are consistent with the shadows seen in Image A, where lighting also plays a crucial role in creating ambient effects.",
