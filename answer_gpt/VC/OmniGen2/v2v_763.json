      "question": "Is the number \"18\" clearly visible on the back of the player's jersey?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character displayed resembles a stylized, chibi version of a baseball player with detailed design elements, including attire. However, the character wears a jersey that features distinct markings. Upon inspection of the visible areas, there is no indication of a visible number '18' printed on the jersey's back, as the attire is visibly different from that of a regular jersey.",

      "question": "Is the number \"18\" visible on the front left side of the player's jersey?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is designed in a chibi style, and its jersey displays a character or symbol on the front left side, but the number '18' is not visible. The character's attire deviates from typical sportswear, contrasting with the design elements in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the player wearing a purple jersey and a purple cap with a black brim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stylized character wearing a jersey and hat. The colors appear to be aligned with a similar purple shade, and while the cap is also purple, it lacks the explicit depiction of a black brim distinct from the jersey color in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character's hands are proportionally small, and while gloves are depicted, they are arranged in stylized, smooth white elements, more consistent with cartoon design rather than practical batting gloves as seen in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the chibi character without holding any baseball equipment directly, and no baseball bat, black or otherwise, is shown being held by the character transformation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized character depiction does not feature a typical baseball scene that includes a baseball with red stitching in motion in the background, unlike Image A where the ball is visibly included.",

      "question": "Is the player in a crouched batting stance with knees bent and torso twisted forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B displays an expressive dynamic pose suitable for illustrations, but lacks the specific bodily posture resemblance, such as crouched position or twisted torso, characteristic of a batting stance, which is fully embodied in Image A's realistic depiction.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The representation shown in Image B, a notable animated transformation, doesn't include routine baseball equipment interaction, notably lacking grips on a bat. This is absent in the creative depiction compared to the realistic portrayal in Image A.",
