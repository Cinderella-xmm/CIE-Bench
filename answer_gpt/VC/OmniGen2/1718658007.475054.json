      "question": "Does the edited image show the octopus with exactly eight tentacles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artistic depiction of the octopus shows well-defined, animated lines representing each tentacle. Visually counting these tentacle shapes, there are eight distinct tentacles, which aligns with a realistic portrayal, as octopuses typically have eight tentacles.",

    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases an octopus with two prominently large and cartoonish eyes centered on its head, which is characteristic of cartoon-style adaptations focusing on simple, exaggerated features.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drawing style of the octopus includes simplified and stylized features, where suction cups are illustrated as a series of caterpillar-like sections along the edges or undersides of the tentacles, which are commonly used to symbolize suction cups in artistic renderings.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the octopus positioned on or adjacent to the beach, with part of its body in the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition places the octopus within a body of water, centered within a colorful and simplified sea and sky scene, but the depiction is more of an artistic design and advertisement style where specific environment details like a beach or precise water interaction are not prominently depicted.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the octopus clearly the largest and most prominent figure in the image, facing directly toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the octopus is the central and most vivid element, prominently placed in the foreground, visually dominating the poster design and gazing directly outward, aligning with typical graphic design strategies to capture attention.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a visible stretch of sandy beach meeting the ocean water in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual does not explicitly feature a sandy beach meeting ocean water in the foreground, as the setting is more abstract, focusing on the octopus itself rather than a full background scene and thus omitting specific realistic environmental elements like a beach.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
