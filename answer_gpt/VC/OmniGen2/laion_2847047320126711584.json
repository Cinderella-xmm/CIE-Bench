      "question": "Is the donut-shaped object retaining a circular form with a central hole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon representation retains the circular form associated with donuts and depicts them with central holes. The characters and objects are exaggerated but still display the fundamental donut shape. The shield and surrounding donuts maintain a circular contour with holes, aligning with common donut appearances.",

      "question": "Does the donut retain its golden-brown baked color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon style visualizes donuts with shades that mimic the golden-brown baked appearance typical of real donuts. This style uses colors common in such representations to connote baked goods, even though their representation is more simplified and stylized in comparison to realistic imagery as seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the surface of the donut covered in visible coarse granulated sugar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, being a cartoon, does not depict the realistic texture of sugar granules on the donut. Although the donuts are illustrated in a simplified manner that may imply texture, they do not visually denote coarse granulated sugar like Image A does. The cartoon does not translate detailed surface textures due to its stylized nature.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's cartoon style prioritizes simplicity and clarity over intricate details, lacking visible individual sugar granules depicted in realistic photography. Management representations of donuts, while capturing iconic features, do not include such detailed accents as distinct sugar granules compared to Image A.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays donuts that maintain a continuous circular ring with a central opening, reflecting the traditional donut shape common in cartoons and illustrations. The depiction aligns with the iconic donut shape, consistent with the traditional representation found in Image A.",
