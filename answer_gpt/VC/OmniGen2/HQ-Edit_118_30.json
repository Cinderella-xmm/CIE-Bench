      "question": "Is the number \"1902\" clearly visible on the front of the locomotive?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examining the front of the locomotive reveals the number '1907' rather than '1902'. Numbers are typically placed prominently on locomotives for identification, making them noticeable even from a distance. Therefore, the visibility and recognition are clear, but the number is not '1902'. The locomotive number has changed between Image A and Image B, likely as part of the artistic modification of the image.",

      "question": "Does the locomotive retain a dominant green color on its body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the locomotive maintains a predominantly green color. Green is a common color for locomotives, often associated with historical trains, and this characteristic is preserved in the edited image. The green color is consistent with the theme of a classic and traditional train style, which is visually appealing and historically accurate.",

      "question": "Is the station building constructed from stone material with visible texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surroundings where the passengers are located do not include a stone building with visible texture. Instead, there are abstract elements consisting of block-like seats on a flat platform, suggesting a more stylized or simplified artistic representation. The realism with detailed textural features is absent, indicating a deliberate choice to change the setting in Image B.",

      "question": "Is there moss growing on the roof of the station building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict moss growing on any station building's roof. The landscape in Image B is more stylized and simplified with abstract forms and lacks detailed textures and elements that would suggest the presence of moss, as seen in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the platform does not feature luggage trunks near passengers. Instead, there are distinct colorful block-like elements representing seating, with no depiction of realistic travel accessories such as luggage trunks, as would be customary in a traditional station setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon inspecting the background landscape beyond the train and station area, wind turbines are absent. The background features hills and fields in a simplified style with clouds in the sky, but the wind turbines present in Image A do not appear in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Is the railway track visibly curved as it extends into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the railway track extends straight into the distance without any visible curve. This styling choice revolves around presenting the scene with simplified, straight lines consistent with the art style of the image, in contrast to a realistic railroad that might show curvature.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the platform features colorful blocks as seating instead of wooden benches. The artistic representation replaces traditional elements like wooden benches with vivid abstract shapes for a stylized effect, deviating from the realistic setting observed in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures on the platform continue to wear clothing reminiscent of early 20th-century fashion, such as top hats and long dresses, indicating consistency with historical attire despite changes in the platform's appearance. This consistency preserves the classic and historical theme even in a stylized setting.",
