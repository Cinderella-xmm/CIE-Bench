      "question": "Does the girl retain her original throwing posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl holds a shield which might restrict her movements. However, her arms appear to be extended outward, similar to a throwing posture. Combining knowledge of body mechanics, it seems she still has her arms positioned to mimic a throwing action, albeit from a sci-fi conceptual standpoint. The posture is consistent in both images.",

      "question": "Are the red dress and polka-dot pattern retained intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clothing items are stylized to appear more fictional or sci-fi; however, analyzing Image A shows a red dress with polka dots. In Image B, colors and patterns may differ due to visualization upgrades but ultimately seem to retain their essential aspects.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the girl still positioned in the foreground relative to the ground or new sci-fi background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite a significant change to a sci-fi background, the girl remains in a foreground position with elements like a garbage bin. Comparing to Image A, foreground positioning is consistent, indicating that her relative position stays the same.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl stands on an altered stone representing a sci-fi pedestal. Comparing Image A shows the original stone, and Image B keeps her feet grounded on its reimagined version, indicating consistency in foot placement.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl's hands are still positioned outward, suggesting a throwing action. Combining this with knowledge of typical body movements, it can be concluded that her action mimics throwing something similar to Image A.",
