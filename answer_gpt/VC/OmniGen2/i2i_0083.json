        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armchairs are clearly visible and appear to be upholstered in a brown fabric, which resembles a soft, plush texture. The legs of the chairs are wooden and are lighter in color, suggesting a typical design where fabric and wood complement each other to provide aesthetic appeal.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two armchairs placed at equal distances on either side of the central display area, which is occupied by the digital screen. Symmetry is an aesthetically pleasing arrangement and commonly used in interior design to create balanced compositions, recognized here as a deliberate choice to focus on the central art piece. This symmetric placement enhances the visual appeal and balance of the space.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wall in Image B is depicted as a simple white surface without any apparent texture or color variation. A plain white wall is a common backdrop choice in interior design, providing a neutral canvas that allows other elements in the room, such as furniture and artwork, to stand out. The absence of distracting details or colors on the wall aids in creating a clean and uncluttered visual aesthetic.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floor reflects light and appears to have a polished finish, typical of wooden flooring with a glossy texture. This type of flooring is often used in modern interiors for its durable properties and its ability to add warmth and elegance to a space. The reflection observed suggests a polished surface common in high-quality wood finishes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts soft shadows beneath the armchairs, visible on the floor. These soft shadows suggest a light source that is diffused or indirect, commonly used in interior settings to create a welcoming and warm atmosphere. The presence of shadows contributes to the perception of depth and the realistic portrayal of three-dimensional space within the image.",
