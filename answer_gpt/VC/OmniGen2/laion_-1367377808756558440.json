        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hull number 'J244' is prominently displayed on the side of the model ship inside the glass dome. The letters and numbers are distinct and clearly visible, similar to the positioning expected on a life-size ship.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship model inside the dome features a flag, but it is not the British flag in terms of design and color scheme. The flag seen has a different pattern compared to the British flag as commonly known.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a miniature model ship with a simplified design that includes a mast and funnel, but the forward gun mount as part of the ship's silhouette, typically found in real ships, is not clearly depicted in the model.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a miniature setting under a dome, with no visible lampposts. The details surrounding the model ship are minimal and do not include elements like lampposts that would be expected on an actual pier.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict any cranes or background elements resembling port infrastructure. The background is mainly the interior of a room, leaving out details such as cranes.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a group of model figurines near the ship model, which could represent individuals. However, there are more than three figures and they appear stationary rather than walking.",
