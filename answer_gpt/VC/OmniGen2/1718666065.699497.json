    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there at least one horn present on the forehead of the unicorn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn has a visibly prominent, spiraled horn on its forehead. This is a common characteristic of unicorns and is unmistakably depicted in the edited image as well, fitting the typical design of mythical unicorns.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the subject have four legs arranged in a horse-like stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn is depicted with four clearly defined legs. The stance is symmetrical and typical of a horse, with all legs firmly positioned as if supporting the body, which matches the horse-like stance.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the unicorn positioned in a three-quarter view facing toward the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the unicorn angled in a three-quarter view, meaning it is not completely side-on or frontal, but at an angle where both the front and some of the side of the body are visible. Its head and body are oriented towards the right of the image while keeping this form.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible dark, oval-shaped eye on the side of the unicorn's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a stylized unicorn with an eye that is not particularly dark or oval-shaped due to its smooth, statue-like representation. The eye is more subtle and not distinctively detailed with darkness or the specific oval form.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the unicorn's head slightly turned toward the viewer, showing part of the left side of the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn is positioned with its head turned slightly towards the viewer, which allows a partial view of the left side of its face. This angle adds to the three-quarter view, displaying some of its left facial structure while looking forward.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the unicorn have a broad, muscular body with a high-set head and arched neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The unicorn in Image B is depicted with a broad and muscular body akin to a robust and powerful horse. It also has a high-set head and an elegantly arched neck, which are characteristic features of such depictions.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the front legs positioned slightly forward, with the back legs supporting the body's weight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn's stance shows the front legs positioned under the body without a noticeable forward lean, and the back legs are also under the body in a stable, supportive position. There is no dynamic positioning suggesting the front legs are significantly forward from a standing still stance.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
