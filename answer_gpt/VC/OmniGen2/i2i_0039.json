      "question": "Is the adult polar bear positioned behind the two cubs, with the cubs visibly interacting with each other?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the adult polar bear is indeed standing behind the two cubs, which are positioned closely next to each other. The cubs seem to be interacting, as their proximity suggests possible interaction. The visual arrangement of the bears indicates the adult's protective posture behind the cubs, typical of polar bear family behavior.",

      "question": "Are the detailed textures of the ice and snow, including ridges and smooth patches, still present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ice and snow textures are visible, including the uneven surfaces comprised of ridges and smooth patches. The addition of text and logos does not obscure these natural details. The visual cues of the edited image show continuity of texture that is common in icy environments.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ocean backdrop is visible, with dark blue water contrasting against the white ice floe. Despite added textual elements, the ocean remains a prominent feature in the top portion of the image, maintaining its visibility as part of the background.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the natural lighting and shadow effects are preserved. The light and shadow on the bears' fur and ice surfaces, indicative of sunlight illuminating these objects, remain intact despite the overlay of text and logos. This retention of shadow and light reinforces the realism of the scene.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the polar bears maintain their distinct white fur coloration, preserving their natural and iconic appearance. Even though text was added, the bears themselves are visually unaltered and their recognizable color and features remain clear.",
