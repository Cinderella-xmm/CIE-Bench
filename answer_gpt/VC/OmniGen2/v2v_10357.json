        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teddy bear is wearing a helmet and a cape that are clearly identifiable by their color and shape. The helmet remains white, and the cape is blue.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the teddy bear with geometric shapes but still maintains the golden-brown color commonly associated with teddy bears. However, the eyes and nose appear to be stylized in a more geometric form and color, rather than standard button eyes and a brown nose, which suggests a change from the traditional look.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the motorcycle retains important structural elements such as the headlight, wheels, and handlebars. These are consistent with the overall shape and design typically seen in motorcycles, even though the color and stylization might differ from the original.",
