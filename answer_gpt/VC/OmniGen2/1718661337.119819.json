      "question": "Is the white powdered wig with tightly curled sides still present on the figure's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure wears a hat typical of steampunk or futuristic styles, with goggles mounted on it, and no visible wig. World knowledge of visual styles indicates that the hat and goggles in Image B are distinct from the historical style seen in Image A. Thus, the white powdered wig characteristic of historical attire in Image A is absent in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the figure wear a tricorne hat with a dark blue base and gold trim around the brim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a steampunk-inspired hat, characterized by an angular design and incorporated goggles. This differs from Image A where a traditional tricorne hat with a blue base and gold trim is prominent, as understood from historical fashion. The clear shift in style confirms that the tricorne hat is no longer present in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the right hand extended forward, gripping an object with the thumb and fingers wrapped around it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's right hand is positioned differently, resting on or near a railing without gripping any specific object, contrasting with Image A where the right hand wraps around a bell. The visual difference is clear and suggests there is no gripping motion in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the left hand positioned near the lower torso, palm facing inward or downward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the left hand resting on the railing or near the body, similar in positioning to Image A where the left hand is also near the torso. This suggests consistency in the posture of the left hand across both images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the facial features including the straight nose, deep-set eyes, and strong jawline still visible and consistent with the original depiction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Faces are blurred in both images, making the specific facial features indiscernible. Without visible facial details in Image B, it's impossible to verify consistency with Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the figure positioned in a three-quarter view, facing slightly to the right with the body angled toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images show the figure positioned in a similar pose, suggesting continuity in angle and position. Image B maintains the three-quarter view typical in portraiture, emphasizing a slight rightward angle which is consistent with the presentation in Image A.",
