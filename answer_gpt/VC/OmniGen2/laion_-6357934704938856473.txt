    "Question": "Q1: Are the red eye lenses present in the head of the robot?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robot has a helmet-like head that matches typical robot designs featuring eye lenses. However, the image taken within a box limits my ability to see the eyes clearly. Usually, robots have distinct lenses to indicate visual sensors, which are often colored with striking colors like red. The design suggests there would be red eye lenses, but due to limited visibility, it's unclear without closer inspection.",
