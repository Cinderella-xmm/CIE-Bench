      "question": "Is the owl perched on a moss-covered branch with visible green moss texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the environment is highly stylized and artistic. The owl appears to be standing on a branch, but the texture and details are not typical of natural moss. Instead, the design is more fantastical with glowing elements and abstract patterns. The visual cues suggest a departure from realistic nature scenes, as the primary focus is on a vibrant, artistic representation.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a small green plant with slender leaves growing next to the owl’s left side on the branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases an artful and imaginative environment, lacking the typical natural elements like small plants with slender leaves. The focus seems to be on the fantastical design, vibrant colors, and glowing patterns, which do not resemble natural plant growth.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background composed of dark, out-of-focus green foliage typical of a forest environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is artistically enhanced with mystical and surreal elements. Although it is dark and green, which is similar to a forest environment, the focus is on the luminous, ethereal qualities, giving it a magical appearance rather than a classic out-of-focus forest setting.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the owl facing directly toward the camera with a slight head tilt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, despite the artistic stylization, displays an owl-like figure that is indeed oriented directly towards the viewer. However, due to the imaginative nature of the artwork, it lacks the typical realistic head tilt, focusing instead on symmetry and balance in design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the branch have a rough, textured surface covered in green moss with visible patches and crevices?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The branch in Image B is part of a stylized representation, characterized by bold, clear lines and bright accents. It does not exhibit the typical rough, textured look associated with moss-covered branches found in nature, as the depiction leans heavily into artistic abstraction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the lighting dim and natural, with subtle highlights on the owl’s feathers and eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is designed to highlight its fantastical quality, with vibrant and glowing colors. This is different from dim natural lighting; instead, the entire scene is bathed in an ethereal glow that emphasizes the vibrancy and stylized features of the artwork.",
