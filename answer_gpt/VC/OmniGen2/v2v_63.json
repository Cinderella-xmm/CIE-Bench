        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the analysis focuses on the row of chibi dolls placed beside the TV. These dolls have distinctive colors that differ from the woman's top in Image A, which is a dusty rose color. There is no depiction of the woman's top in the second image as the chibi dolls are designed in contrasting red and blue. Therefore, the woman's top is not shown to be dusty rose in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a series of chibi dolls, and the analysis identifies that these dolls are simplistic in design and painted in red and blue colors. The details do not extend to the woman's pants being visible, since the focus is on the last image with the dolls rather than the woman's attire, making the answer 'No.'",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi dolls based on the woman show consistent styling and have various designs, but do not depict the woman's hair color. The brown color seen in Image A is not represented in the simplified doll forms which do not carry realistic hair colors, opting for stylized designs. Thus, 'No' is the correct option.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a TV placed on a wooden table, similar to Image A, with clear visibility of its positioning on a wooden surface. Despite the additional presence of chibi dolls, the television remains consistent with its location. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes.'",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the series of chibi dolls show exaggerated and stylized forms of the woman's likeness, and none of these figurative representations display any additional hand placements such as touching the TV's edge, unlike the first image showing actual hand placement by the woman. Hence, the answer is 'No.'",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a consistent background style as Image A with an off-white wall, ensuring that there is no observably distinct alteration in the wall's color between both images. Thus, the background wall retains its plain off-white color in Image B.",
