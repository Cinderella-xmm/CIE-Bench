    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the mustache present and clearly defined above the upper lip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the area above the upper lip where a mustache would typically be is blurred, which prevents identification of any facial features, including a mustache. There is no visually clear mustache present, as the illustration appears to focus on stylized elements rather than specific face details.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both eyes closed in the facial expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face is blurred, and specific details about facial expressions, such as whether the eyes are open or closed, cannot be determined. Thus, there is no indication of closed eyes in the facial expression.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the figure’s right arm resting on the back of the chair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right arm is positioned in front, with both hands neatly folded and resting on the figure's lap, as opposed to resting on the back of the chair. This is evident due to the clear depiction of the suited figure in a formal and symmetrical posture.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the figure depicted in a seated position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a suited figure sitting in an armchair, with both legs aligned and the body relaxed in a seated pose. This is a typical seated pose one would expect in a formal setting.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination of Image B, there is no visible text or numbering in the bottom right corner of the image, indicative of an absence of the number “27826” or any numerical marking.",
