      "question": "Is the van’s body primarily green with a cream-colored roof and beige trim along the lower edge and windows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the van's body is visually primarily green. The roof appears to be of a different color, possibly cream, and there's a trim along the lower edge and windows that might pass as beige. The overall look of the van in Image B is consistent with the description given in the question. Based on the observed color scheme and design features of the van in Image B, it aligns with the description in the question.",

      "question": "Is there a wooden luggage rack mounted on the roof of the van?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the roof of the van has a structure that likely resembles a luggage rack, which is typically found on vans for storage purposes during travel. While it’s not detailed enough to explicitly identify as wooden without touching or closer examination, it seems consistent with a wooden luggage rack in its placement and function on a road trip van.",

      "question": "Does the van have a rounded front with two large windshield windows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the van’s front is visible and indeed looks rounded, common to the style of certain retro vans that often have aerodynamic designs. It also features two large windshield windows at the front, allowing better visibility for the driver, fitting the description asked in the question based on the visual cues in the image.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there round headlights and a chrome bumper visible on the front of the van?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, despite it being a cartoon, the van does show elements that suggest headlights and a front bumper, though details like making out chrome specifics aren't clear due to the cartoonish style. However, from design norms, a van like this typically has round headlights and a chrome bumper.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the van depicted in an isometric (angled top-down) perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the van in a side view, which typically appears in comic books and cartoons to depict narratives. An isometric view would involve seeing the top and sides at an angle, unlike the straightforward side view noticed here.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors in the image warm tones such as yellow, green, and brown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a scene set in a desert with a noticeable presence of yellow sands, green shrubs, and a green van, with brown elements like a cactus. These colors are predominantly warm tones, which convey the warm climate of a desert setting, aligning with the color scheme described in the question.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there at least three stylized brown cacti visible in the desert scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the desert backdrop contains visible elements of cacti; however, they do not appear to be prominently stylized or primarily brown in number as described in the question. Instead, there are other desert plants presented. Comparing with Image A could offer clarity, but based solely on Image B, the given description does not significantly match.",
