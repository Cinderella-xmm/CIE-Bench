      "question": "Is the figure in the top-right corner still shown with its right arm raised high, holding a weapon aloft?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure in the top-right corner has its right arm raised, and it is holding an object that resembles a weapon. The raised arm position and the grasp on a weapon-like object are consistent with a stance where a weapon is held aloft. Therefore, the figure is still shown in this way.",

      "question": "Does the figure in the bottom-left corner still show a hand gripping a curved blade in its right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure in the bottom-left corner holds an object that resembles a weapon, and given the shape, it can be interpreted as a curved blade. The position and the grip on the object in the right hand match the description. Thus, the figure still shows a hand gripping a curved blade.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the figure in the bottom-left corner still in a kneeling position with one knee on the ground and the other leg bent forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom-left figure is not shown in a kneeling position. Unlike a kneeling stance where one knee is on the ground, both legs appear to be simultaneously engaged in a standing or crouching posture. Therefore, the figure is not in a kneeling position.",

    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure in the top-left corner has its body oriented slightly to the left, while the head is turned toward the viewer. This positioning indicates that the figure's facial orientation is directed towards the front, aligning with the viewer's line of sight.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom-right figure is shown holding a long weapon-like object with a noticeable vertical orientation in its right hand. The shape and posture suggest that it is consistent with the description of holding a long, vertical weapon.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the posture of the top-right figure's left leg suggests it is bent in a manner that supports a forward stance. However, the leg does not visibly exhibit a backward bend typical of a lunging position, making it appear more upright.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a feature that appears to be a pendant around the neck of the bottom-right figure, which is shaped like a skull. The visual cue of a skull shape is apparent, confirming the presence of such a pendant around its neck.",
