      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the car displays a small emblem or logo centrally positioned on the hood.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car's front headlights appear elongated, narrow, and angular, resembling trapezoidal shapes with distinct sharp edges. Using knowledge of modern sports car designs, such headlights are common and add to the aesthetic appeal and aerodynamic efficiency. The shape closely aligns with the description given in the question.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the car's wheels are shown clearly with red elements visible behind them, which are likely the brake calipers given their typical placement and color in performance vehicles. Red brake calipers are often used for visual enhancement and are common in high-performance sports cars like McLaren.",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the car exhibits a sleek, shiny appearance indicative of a metallic silver paint finish. Such paintwork typically reflects light creating a glossy look. The reflections on the car's surfaces confirm this description as they are consistent with the finish attributes of metallic coatings.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows distinct lines originating from the front area and running along the side, characteristic of dihedral doors found in cars like McLaren. This design is typical in sports cars and assists with aerodynamic performance and aesthetics. The visibility of this line affirms the question's description.",
