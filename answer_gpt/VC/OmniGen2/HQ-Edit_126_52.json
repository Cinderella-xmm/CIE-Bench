    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the cactus still spherical in overall shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus is shaped like a faceted crystal with multiple branches extending upwards and sideways, which gives it a more rigid and angular appearance, unlike the spherical shape of a traditional cactus. This conclusion is drawn from the visual cues in Image B where the cactus is clearly different from a sphere due to its sharp edges and elongated segments.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the vertical ribs of the cactus clearly visible and maintaining their segmented pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus does not showcase any traditional segmented patterns or vertical ribs typical of cacti. Instead, it features symbols etched onto its surface, suggesting a different design element focused on decorative aspects rather than botanical accuracy.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the main body of the cactus still predominantly green in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the changes in shape and texture, the main body of the cactus in Image B is still predominantly green, which can be concluded from the consistent green color observed on the structure's surface.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the cactus positioned vertically and resting on a flat surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cactus in Image B is depicted standing vertically upright, positioned atop a large, circular stone container, indicating that it is indeed positioned vertically and resting on this flat, stable surface.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a textured, flat surface beneath the cactus container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beneath the cactus container is a sandy desert surface, which does not appear flat and textured like the wooden plank in Image A. Instead, it presents a more natural, uneven terrain typical of deserts.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the cactus placed directly above a supporting structure (such as a pedestal or pot)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cactus in Image B is clearly placed on a large, round stone pot, which acts as a supporting structure, similar to how a plant pot functions. The pot is visually distinct and provides a base for the cactus.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the light source coming from the upper left, casting shadows toward the lower right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the direct lighting appears to come from the top or slightly to the right, as evidenced by the presence of highlight reflections and the general lighting on the cactus surface. There are no visual cues indicating shadows specifically being cast toward the lower right, suggesting a different direction for the light source.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
