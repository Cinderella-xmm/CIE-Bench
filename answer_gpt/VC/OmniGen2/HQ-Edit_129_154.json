      "question": "Are the floral and foliate engraved patterns visible on the body of the transformed owl, arranged symmetrically between vertical ribs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the owl exhibits engraved floral and foliate patterns that are symmetrically arranged along vertical divisions, which resemble the appearance of vertical ribs on its body. This indicates that the patterns follow a symmetrical arrangement as they are distributed evenly between these divisions, maintaining consistency with decorative symmetry found in similar metallic engravings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the transformed owl retain a shiny, polished metallic surface consistent with the original teapot’s finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl displays a shiny, polished metallic surface. This finish closely resembles the sheen and reflective quality found on the teapot in Image A, suggesting that the transformed owl does retain a similar polished metallic appearance.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the beak of the mechanical owl shaped like the original teapot’s curved spout, extending forward and slightly upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The beak of the owl in Image B is designed to resemble the spout, extending forward and slightly upward. This similarity in positioning and flow matches the characteristic curve observed in the spout of the teapot in Image A, indicating a deliberate design choice to mimic the spout with the owl's beak.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the tail of the mechanical owl follow the same graceful C-shaped curve as the original teapot’s handle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tail in Image B is indeed reminiscent of a C-shaped curve akin to the original handle of the teapot in Image A. The owl's tail exhibits the same graceful curvature, creating a continuity between the original handle design and the owl's structure.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the crown-like head of the mechanical owl include a pointed, tiered finial matching the original teapot’s lid top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl's head does not include a pointed, tiered finial. Unlike the teapot lid in Image A, which does have a tiered finial, the owl's design transforms this feature into a distinct owl head with eyes and feathers, omitting such a finial.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the body segments of the mechanical owl divided into vertical ribs, each housing a decorative motif, mirroring the original teapot’s structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the mechanical owl with its body segmented by vertical ribs, each section featuring a decorative motif. This design choice mirrors the structure of the original teapot in Image A, where similar segmentation and motif placement were observed, indicating continuity in the ornamental design between the two images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the ornamental scrollwork present at the base of the mechanical owl’s tail, corresponding to the original handle’s end?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design of Image B shows scrollwork at the base of the owl’s tail, similar to the scroll detail found at the end of the original teapot’s handle in Image A. This suggests that the decorative element was preserved through the transformation from handle to tail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the tail of the mechanical owl rendered in a dark brown tone consistent with the original handle’s color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tail of the owl does not appear to be in a dark brown tone. Instead, it maintains the same metallic finish as the rest of the body, contrasting with the more distinctively colored handle of the original teapot in Image A, which is brown.",
      "weight": 1,
