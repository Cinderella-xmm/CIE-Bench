      "question": "Does the chibi keychain feature a large, singular pearl earring on the girl's left ear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By observing Image B, we can see the chibi keychain shows a stylized cartoon character. Typically, chibi figures emphasize facial features with simplified details, but in the presented keychain, the girl does not appear to have any pearls or earrings visible near her left ear. This simplification is common in chibi designs. Visual cues from the image confirm no such accessory is present.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the chibi figure wearing a headscarf with distinct blue and yellow sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character has a turquoise blue helmet-like hair design that resembles neither scarves nor the distinct blue and yellow sections. Chibi designs simplify forms, often resulting in single-color hair accessories or shapes. The turquoise hair is homogenous and does not reflect a headscarf with separate color sections.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the chibi keychain show the girl dressed in a dark yellow garment with a visible white collar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the chibi figure wearing a pink dress with blue buttons, rather than a dark yellow garment. Though chibi styles may simplify clothing, there is no semblance to dark yellow in the attire shown, nor is there a visible white collar as part of the design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the chibi figure depicted with the head turned slightly towards the front, facing the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi in Image B is facing directly forward, typical of chibi styling where characters interact with viewers by being oriented directly to them, emphasizing facial engagement. This direct face-on view is consistent throughout many chibi representations.",

      "question": "Is the chibi keychain attached to a small silver keyring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual clues in Image B show the chibi keychain affixed to a simple silver metal keyring. The ring is held between fingers and is consistent with commonly used color and material types for keyrings, such as silver or metallic hues.",
