      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the overall bombe (curved, outward-bulging) silhouette of the commode preserved in the LEGO version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dresser exhibits an outward-bulging curve that is characteristic of a bombe silhouette. This observation is derived from the visual analysis of the curves along the sides of the dresser which bulge outward before returning to form at the base, a hallmark feature of bombe commodes. Combining knowledge of classic furniture design, it's evident that the LEGO version tries to mimic this distinctive shape, even if stylized.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there exactly two drawers stacked vertically on the front of the dresser, each framed by brass mounts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two discernible divisions on the front facade indicating two separate horizontal sections, which align with the concept of stacked drawers. LEGO elements resembling frames are visible around these sections, simulating brass mounts. By recognizing common dresser design and using visual evidence, it's logical to conclude that these represent drawers.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the herringbone and starburst marquetry pattern visible on the front of both drawers in the LEGO version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfaces on the front of the drawers are plain, lacking any complex marquetry patterns such as herringbone or starbursts. The surface only displays simple colors without intricate designs, which demonstrates a lack of detailed woodwork patterns typically found in marquetry. This observation is based on the visible simplicity of LEGO bricks compared to complex marquetry techniques.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the ornate brass mounts with acanthus leaf scrolls present around the edges of both drawers and along the side panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features yellow LEGO elements mimicking ornate brass mounts around the drawers and sides, but they do not explicitly show acanthus leaf scrolls with the details and intricacy typical of real brass mounts. The scrolling patterns appear simplified due to the limitations of LEGO design, suggesting that detailed foliage designs are absent.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the legs curve outward in a cabriole fashion and terminate in brass sabots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the legs of the dresser curve outward in a fashion reminiscent of cabriole legs, and they end in what can conceptually be understood as brass sabots, represented by yellow LEGO elements. This observation combines visual cues with knowledge of furniture leg designs that typically curve outward and terminate in mounts or sabots, common in bombe commodes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a scalloped apron below the drawers, following the curve of the bombe shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a lower edge that mimics the scalloped line below the two drawer divisions. This characteristic curve is consistent with the bombe silhouette design where the bottom apron follows the unique contour. Using observations and common knowledge about dresser silhouettes, the presence of this design feature is affirmed.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the top surface rectangular and flush with the upper edge of the dresser body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top surface in Image B appears to be flat, rectangular, and aligns with the upper boundary of the dresser body, indicative of a flush finish. This assessment is based on the visual alignment of the top with the sides and common design logic for the top surface of dressers, ensuring practical and aesthetic harmony.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are the decorative elements (brass mounts, marquetry, legs) symmetrically arranged on both sides of the dresser?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO version in Image B shows an attempt to symmetrically arrange yellow elements mimicking brass mounts on both sides of the dresser. Visual observation shows symmetric placement on each side, suggesting a deliberate design choice emulating original symmetry seen in classical furniture design.",
