      "question": "Is the circular gold-tone MK logo charm present and clearly visible on the model’s attire or accessories?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the circular MK logo charm is attached to the handbag prominently placed in the foreground, which is visually separated from the runway model in the background. There are no circular MK logos present on the model's attire or accessories; the charm is exclusive to the handbag, which is the central object in the image.",

      "question": "Is the \"MICHAEL KORS\" brand name visible in gold uppercase letters near the upper right area of the model’s attire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the 'MICHAEL KORS' brand name in gold letters is seen on the handbag, not on the model's attire. Given the design and placement, it is unlikely that the model has any branding visible on her outfit. The focus is on the handbag branding rather than the model.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The model's dress in image B does not exhibit a pebbled texture similar to the handbag. The bag has a distinct leather texture, while the model's dress visually appears smooth and without surface texture details in the context of the image.",

      "question": "Are gold-tone hardware elements (such as buckles, zippers, or clasps) visibly incorporated into the model’s accessories or outfit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses on the handbag, which contains visible gold-tone hardware like buckles and zippers. These elements are part of the bag and not part of the model’s attire, as her outfit does not visibly incorporate such hardware details.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The zippered pocket with a gold-tone pull is a feature of the handbag in the foreground of image B. The model's outfit does not show any pockets or zippers, as the focus is not on the outfit's details but rather on the handbag's features.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the model's stance or posture does not mimic the curved handle shapes of the handbag. The handles are part of the bag displayed in front, while the model in the background stands independently on the runway without copying the curvature of the handbag's handles.",
