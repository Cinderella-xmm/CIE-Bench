        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the logo is not visible as the image depicts an illustration or stylized representation of the couple, rather than the backdrop from Image A which had logos. Therefore, based on visual cues, the logo is absent in the edited image.",
