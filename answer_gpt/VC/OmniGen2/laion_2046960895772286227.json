      "question": "Is the floral/paisley pattern in red-brown tones with green trim present on the jacket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jacket appears to be a solid color with no visible floral or paisley patterning. The visual cues indicate that the jacket has a plain texture, lacking the complexity of a floral or paisley design. This assessment is made through the observation of the smooth surface of the fabric, free from any intricate patterns or contrasting colors that would signify such designs.",

      "question": "Are the symmetrical teal triangular appliqués positioned near the hem of the pale blue-gray skirt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible teal triangular appliqués positioned near the hem of the skirt. These appliqués are visible through the contrast in color and their placement on the lighter fabric of the skirt. The symmetrical positioning can be discerned from the repeated pattern along the hemline.",

      "question": "Is a teal ribbon tied in a bow at the waist of the jacket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waist of the dress does not have a bow or teal ribbon tied around it. Instead, the dress features a solid, fitted waist without any additional embellishments or ties. The observation is based on the continuous fabric of the bodice, not interrupted by a distinct belt or ribbon.",

      "question": "Does the jacket have flared sleeves and a wide collar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jacket shown on the mannequin has long sleeves that taper towards the wrist and a high neckline with lace detailing rather than a wide collar. The visual cues suggest an elegant design more consistent with the structured style often found in period clothing. The absence of a flared or wide collar is evident in the fitted nature of these features on the mannequin.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the green trim on the jacket and the teal appliqués on the skirt share a similar hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jacket does not feature any green trim compared to the teal appliqués present on the skirt. As there is no green trim in the jacket observed in Image B, a direct color comparison is not feasible. The teal appliqués stand out distinctly on the skirt.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no buttons are visible on the front center of the jacket, which affects the interpretation of the design as buttonless in this context. This observation is made through an examination of the continuous texture across the front of the jacket presented in the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows vertical folds and draping apparent in the skirt fabric, providing it with the characteristic flowing appearance typical of garments that require multiple layers or panels to create volume. These draping features contribute a dynamic quality to the skirt's design.",
