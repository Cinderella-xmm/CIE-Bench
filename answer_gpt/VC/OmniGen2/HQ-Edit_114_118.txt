    "Question": "Q1: Does the ship retain exactly three masts, with sails arranged in tiers on each mast?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ship is inside a glass dome which makes it appear as a model. The masts of the ship are clearly depicted, showing exactly three masts. Each mast has sails arranged in tiers, consistent with traditional sailing ship design. This is evident from the visual structure where multiple horizontal sails are affixed at different height levels on each mast.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the ship’s hull shaped with a raised stern and a decorated, upward-curving prow?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ship does indeed have a hull that curves upwards at the prow, showing a traditional ship design with a curved front. The stern is elevated relative to the rest of the ship, a common characteristic in historical ship models which is clearly visible in the glass dome depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there multiple sails on each of the three masts, with at least two tiers per mast?",
    "explanation": "In analyzing Image B, each of the three masts has multiple sails. The sails are distributed in multiple tiers, commonly seen in historical ships, which is clearly evident by the layered alignment of the sails along each mast.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there at least five seagulls visible in flight around the ship?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are seagulls depicted around the ship within the glass dome. Upon counting, there are three seagulls visible flying near the ship, which is less than five.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the ship oriented such that the bow points toward the left side of the image and is slightly elevated?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ship's orientation shows that the bow is pointing toward the right side of the image. It is enclosed in a glass dome, and thus no considerable elevation is visible that would suggest the bow is elevated. The positioning indicates a standard right-facing direction with minimal tilt or elevation of the bow.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there visible portholes along the sides of the ship’s hull?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the ship inside a glass dome with significant detail. Upon examination, there are no visible portholes along the sides of the ship’s hull, likely due to the scale and style of the model.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the ship positioned above the surface of the water/resin layer, appearing to float?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the model ship inside the glass dome appears to be situated above a blue resin layer that resembles water. This positioning, typical for model displays, gives the illusion that the ship is floating above the surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"
