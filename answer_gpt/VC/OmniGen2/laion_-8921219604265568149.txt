    "Question": "Q1: Is the clock face present on the upper section of the left bell tower?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the left bell tower of the miniature model doesn't have any clock face visible.

    "Question": "Q2: Are there two bells visible in the arches of the right bell tower?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the model based on a church or cathedral style tends to not have real, functional bells visible due to scale and design limitations. The arches of the right bell tower do not show any bells. In contrast, Image A, which is a real-world depiction, shows multiple bells in the right tower. However, the edited image lacks this detail.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a circular stained-glass window with a floral or star-like pattern centered above the main entrance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the model's facade has architectural features like windows, but there's no presence of a detailed stained-glass window above the main entrance.
