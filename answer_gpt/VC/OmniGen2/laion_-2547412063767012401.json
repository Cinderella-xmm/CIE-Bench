    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the three figures positioned such that one is on the left, one in the center, and one on the right from the viewer's perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are three figures clearly depicted in a structured manner. The arrangement of these figures is such that there is one figure on the left side, one in the center, and one on the right side of the image from the viewer's perspective. This arrangement is typically used for balanced composition in group images. The figures are wearing armor in a fictional style, which distinguishes each one, making their positions more pronounced.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the central figure standing fully upright with both feet on the rock and facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure is indeed standing upright. The posture suggests being firm and composed, common for characters depicted as protectors or warriors. Both feet are depicted as part of the balanced stance of the central figure, facing forward as expected from a typical heroic or commanding pose in illustrations and artworks.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the ocean visible in the background behind the figures, with waves breaking against rocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background does not show a realistic representation of the ocean or waves. Instead of natural elements, it features a stylized and artistic design that uses vibrant colors and abstract patterns resembling a sunset or sky. There is no particular focus on detailed elements like the ocean or waves breaking against rocks; the attention is more on the fantasy-themed attire of the figures.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the figures standing on dark, jagged rock formations in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures appear to be standing on a stylized surface. The depiction is artistic rather than realistic, leaning towards a smooth area rather than detailed jagged rock formations. The foreground does not have the rough and rugged characteristic of dark, jagged rocks but is instead part of a cartoonish or illustrated style.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sun positioned directly behind the central figure, creating a bright glow between his legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no clear depiction of the sun creating a bright glow directly behind the central figure. Instead, the entire scene consists of a vibrant, fantasy-styled background that suggests lighting emanating from behind the scene as a whole, portraying a radiant aura but not specifically illuminated between the figure's legs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a clear horizon line separating the sky from the ocean in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artistic style does not provide a clear, realistic horizon line. Rather, it has an abstract representation of a colorful sunset environment without a specific division between sky and ocean. The composition focuses on the artwork and thematic elements, thus lacking a detailed horizon line like in realistic settings.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the figure on the right have long, wavy hair extending past the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all figures are wearing helmets as part of their armor, characteristic of fantasy or medieval depictions, so their hair is not visible. Helmets typically conceal head and shoulder features that might include hair, making it impossible to determine the hairstyle or length.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Does the figure on the left have curly, light brown hair reaching past the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are adorned with armored helmets. As in most illustrations with armored characters, helmets are designed to obscure hairstyles, making it impossible to see any particular hair features such as color, texture, or length.",
