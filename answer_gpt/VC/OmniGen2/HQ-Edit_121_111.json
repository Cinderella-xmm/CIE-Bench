      "question": "Is the squirrel depicted in an upright stance, supported by its hind legs, with its front paws raised toward its mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the squirrel is shown in a seated position rather than an upright stance. Its hind legs are not used for support in an upright position. The front paws are raised but not specifically toward its mouth; they are holding the acorn, which is not a typical gesture of feeding, as might be implied by raised paws toward the mouth.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the squirrel’s facial features, including its dark round eyes, pointed nose, and visible whiskers, clearly present and accurately rendered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel's facial features are very clear and well-rendered. The eyes appear large and round, contributing to a slightly whimsical appearance. The nose is pointed, and whiskers are drawn prominently, emphasizing detail and accuracy typical of illustrations intended to be lively and engaging.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the squirrel have a large, bushy tail that curves upward and backward over its body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel indeed features a large and bushy tail. However, rather than curving prominently over its body, the tail is stylized to curve slightly, contributing to the whimsical nature with a flowing appearance. This meets the criteria of a large, bushy tail curving to some extent.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a wooden pencil visible in the lower right foreground, partially embedded in the grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible wooden pencil present in the lower right foreground or otherwise in the image. The setting focuses more on the fantasy portrayal of the jewels and acorns and does not include a pencil as a conventional or narrative element.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include a paintbrush with a red handle or any such item in its upper right corner. The illustration centers around the fantastical squirrel and does not introduce a real-world utensil like a paintbrush, possibly to maintain a consistent tone and theme throughout the image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel’s front paws are indeed clasping an acorn, implying tight grasping with fingers wrapped around it. This is consistent with the typical depiction of squirrels gathering or holding items, contributing to the lively and realistic aspect of the illustration despite its fantastical style.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel is shown standing on a stylized green surface implying grass but doesn't exhibit distinct blades or soil areas. The focus is more on the decorative and fantastical elements such as jewels rather than realistic ground texture.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the squirrel with ears that are upright and pointed, complementing the lively style. The inner fur is rendered as a bright shade that can be associated with orange despite being part of the artistic color palette, fitting with the fantastical nature.",
