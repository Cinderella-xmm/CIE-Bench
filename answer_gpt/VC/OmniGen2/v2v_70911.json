      "question": "Is the AXE logo still visible on the container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the container clearly displays the AXE logo in an angled style on its front side, just as it commonly appears on AXE products. Recognizing this involves understanding standard branding practices where logos are prominently displayed on such products.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the container retain its cylindrical shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the container appears to have a non-cylindrical shape; it tapers at the bottom rather than being a straight cylinder. This involves understanding geometric shapes visually, where a cylinder typically has straight, parallel sides.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the fiery red and energetic pink hues from the label's explosive design still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the explosive design with vibrant red and pink hues, consistent with the brand's dynamic labeling style. Recognizing the colors involves visual assessment of the imageâ€™s palette and understanding brand design elements.",

      "question": "Is the net weight text (\"NET WT 2.64 OZ (75g)\") still visible on the label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the net weight text remains visible near the bottom of the label. This requires focusing on specific textual details within the product's label and recognizing the conventional placement of such product information.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the container depicted as mostly intact, with only a crack allowing the nebula to be seen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the container with a design modification where the top features a nebula, not merely a crack. The nebula is seamlessly integrated into the top of the container instead of appearing through a break, suggesting a complete thematic edit rather than just a partial view. Recognizing this comes from knowledge of visual edits and thematic design integration.",
