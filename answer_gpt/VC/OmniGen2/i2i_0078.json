      "question": "Is the wristwatch's design still black and silver post-editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch features a black and silver design, which is commonly used in luxury and stylish watches, offering a classic and elegant look. The bezel remains black, and the watch continues to have silver elements, maintaining the overall color scheme. This matches the common style of black and silver in watch designs.",

      "question": "Does the watch still have a white face with black hour markers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wristwatch has a white dial with black hour markers, which is a classic design choice that offers clear readability and a contrast that enhances the watch's face. This design element is unchanged in the edited version, maintaining its traditional aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the watch still equipped with a metallic bracelet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wristwatch is no longer equipped with a metallic bracelet; it now features a black leather strap. The inclusion of a leather strap gives the watch a different style, often associated with a more formal or vintage appearance. This change is noted through the visual characteristics of the black material with a different texture than metal.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the wristwatch still placed on the same white surface in its original position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The context and setting in Image B are entirely different. The watch is now placed on a wooden surface within a warmly lit interior setting reminiscent of a train station, rather than the simple white surface seen in Image A. The environment's distinct characteristics, such as warm lighting and structural details in the background, clearly indicate a change in location.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the original lighting and shadows of the watch preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting and shadows in Image B are very different from those in Image A. The edited image shows the watch under warm, ambient lighting, resulting in different shadow directions and a warmer color palette, in contrast to the more neutral and even lighting of Image A. This creates a wholly distinct visual atmosphere.",
