      "question": "Does the figurine retain the elephant's large ears and trunk as part of its general silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi elephant figurine clearly features large ears and a prominent trunk, which are key characteristics of an elephant's silhouette. This analysis is based on the distinctive visual representation of the elephant’s anatomy, common in both real-life and illustrated forms. These traits are typical and central to how elephants are depicted, even in stylized versions like figurines.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the chibi figurine depicted holding grass with its trunk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine's trunk is not depicted as holding any grass; it simply hangs naturally. Contrasting this with Image A, where the elephant is actively holding and eating grass, the figurine lacks such an element of interaction, indicating it's a static model not performing a similar action.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the figurine's surface include a subtle representation of the elephant's wrinkled skin texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the figurine in Image B does not show a detailed representation of the elephant’s wrinkled skin texture. It appears smooth and stylized, likely as a simplified artistic choice for a figurine, differing from the textured, wrinkled skin seen in the real elephant from Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the figurine maintain the elephant’s grey body color and brownish ear tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B maintains an overall grey body color that represents the typical elephant skin color. However, it does not have the highlighted brownish tones on the ears as seen in Image A. The visual impression seems to favor a uniform color approach for simplicity and coherence in the figurine's design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, 'Jungle Friend' is clearly visible and appears to be inscribed around the base of the figurine, presenting a label or name for the figurine. The words are prominently placed as part of the figurine's design, suggesting its thematic connection or series title.",
