    "Question": "Q1: Is the subject depicted in a horizontal plank pose, supported by hands and toes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is represented as a LEGO-style figurine that is kneeling on one knee with a hand resting on a small animal, resembling a kangaroo or dog. This is different from Image A, where the person is in a horizontal plank pose supported by hands and toes. In the LEGO representation, the pose doesn't allow for a horizontal plank position, which suggests a more static and balanced position.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the subject wearing a sleeveless tank top and shorts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO-style figurine wears a black sleeveless top and shorts, which aligns with the attire of Image A where the person is also wearing similar clothing. The sleeveless shirt and shorts are recognizable by the color and form even in the stylized depiction of Image B, confirming the attire.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the background maintain a clean and minimalistic aesthetic?",
    "explanation": "The visual cue in Image B shows a neutral, simple background which is typical of LEGO-style showcases. The minimalistic design is further accentuated by the transparent display case around the figurine. This resembles the clean and minimalistic aesthetic of Image A, which also has a plain background. Both images emphasize the subject against a plain backdrop.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the subject's muscles visibly defined, indicating physical strength?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, given the LEGO-style representation, details about physical musculature and definition are highly abstracted. LEGO figures typically do not exhibit defined muscles due to their simplistic design. In comparison, Image A presents a person with visibly defined muscles indicating physical strength. The simplistic and abstract nature of LEGO means that muscles are not portrayable in detail, unlike the real-life depiction.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the subject looking upward, conveying focus and determination?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the facial expression or direction of gaze is not evident due to the simplistic nature of the LEGO-style figure and the blurred face. Compared to Image A, where the individual might convey focus and determination through the upward gaze, the abstraction limits this feature. The LEGO design of heads and faces does not support detailed expressions, making it difficult to determine focus or direction accurately.",
    "answer": "No"
