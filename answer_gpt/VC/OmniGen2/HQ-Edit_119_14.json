      "question": "Is the full white beard present on the figureâ€™s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is dressed in a 19th-century-style costume, representative of a gentleman in that era. Part of the costume includes the figure wearing a top hat with a feather and dressed in a black suit with a high collar and cravat. However, there's no indication of any facial hair in this attire concerning the face of the figure. Thus, based on the visible clothing style and decor, it supports that a beard isn't part of the presented style.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The attire and setting in Image B reflect a Western 19th-century style, with the figure dressed in a black suit and hat, posing in front of a manor house. There is no attire or cultural symbol such as a tilak typically associated with different cultural attire on the face.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face of the figure is obscured such that specific facial expressions cannot be discerned. Therefore, an open-mouthed smile showing teeth cannot be identified from the visible elements.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is dressed in a formal manner typical of Western 19th-century attire and is depicted in a standard pose expected of portraits from this era, where the arms are positioned close to the body, appearing relaxed.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is shown from the waist up, wearing a full suit that extends from top to bottom, but does not represent a full-body view. Therefore, based on the visible elements, the full-body view is not depicted.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has applied a blur effect over the facial area which intentionally obscures facial details, including skin tone, texture, and any natural wrinkles. Hence, preservation of these elements is not achieved.",
