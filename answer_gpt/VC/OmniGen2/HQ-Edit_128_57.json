      "question": "Is the lion’s head medallion present at the center of the desk's front panel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a medallion with a decorative motif at the center of the desk's front panel, featuring a design different from a lion's head—it resembles more of a crown or lyre shape. Image A shows a lion's head medallion, which has a distinctly recognizable shape that is not present in Image B. Comparing both, it's clear that the design in Image B is not a lion's head.",

      "question": "Does the quill maintain its feather shape, even if stylized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quill maintains a feather shape, characterized by a central shaft with barbs extending outward, which aligns with the common visual representation of a feather. The stylization does not deviate from this overall feather form. Image A also depicts the quill as feather-shaped, confirming consistency in this feature across both images.",

      "question": "Is the book depicted as open, showing two pages of aged, yellowed paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book is open, prominently displaying two blank pages with a more modern, cream or light-colored tone, lacking the aged and yellowed appearance. In Image A, the book is open as well, but shows aged, yellowed paper with visible text suggesting an old, historic document. Observing these differences, it's clear that Image B does not feature aged, yellowed paper.",

      "question": "Does the desk retain its dark wood texture and finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the desk features a polished wood texture with a rich, medium brown finish, showcasing decorative carvings and a central emblem. While visually appealing, the wood does not exhibit the darker, more rustic tone observed in Image A. In Image A, the desk appears in a darker brown, almost black finish, more typical of antique or heavy wood furniture. Thus, the texture and finish in Image B differ from the dark wood of Image A.",

      "question": "Is the arched window with a grid of leaded glass panes visible behind the desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible arched window behind the desk; instead, the background is comprised mainly of bookshelves. Image A displays an arched window with a grid of leaded glass panes prominently behind the desk, providing natural light to the room. Comparing the two images, it is clear that Image B lacks this architectural feature.",

      "question": "Are tall bookshelves with rows of leather-bound books visible to the left of the desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookshelves are directly behind the desk rather than to the side, showing rows of leather-bound books but not from a side perspective. Image A features tall bookshelves distinctly to the left of the desk with visible rows of leather-bound books. Therefore, the position of the bookshelves relative to the desk differs between the two images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dominant colors are noted as medium brown and cream, with an emphasis on polished wood. The deep red/blue tones are absent. In contrast, Image A employs dark brown with an aged, classic feel, and deep red/brown tones in both the desk and surroundings, suggesting a more traditional ambiance. The lack of deep red/blue in Image B indicates a difference in color dominance.",
