    "Question": "Q2: Is the king located in the central position of the visible row of black pieces?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows chess pieces as part of a fantastical scene. There is no explicit row of black chess pieces with a king centrally positioned among them. Instead, pieces are part of the overall artistic arrangement.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are there exactly two bishops, two knights, and at least four pawns visible in their original positions?",

    "Question": "Q4: Do the shadows of the chess pieces extend diagonally toward the bottom-left of the frame?",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the wood grain texture of the chessboard surface visible across the light squares?",

}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a blurred background with horizontal structural lines visible behind the chessboard?",

}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are there exactly eight black chess pieces visible in the image?",
