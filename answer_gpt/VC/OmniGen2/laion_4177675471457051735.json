      "question": "Is the deep burgundy lip color present on the subject's lips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject’s lips are blurred, making it impossible to discern the exact color or whether a deep burgundy lip color is present. Based on the visible elements like regalia and traditional attire, it's common in portraits or historical paintings for subjects to have neutral or natural lip colors rather than dramatic ones. Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude the deep burgundy lip color is not definitively present.",

      "question": "Is the black beaded mesh veil covering the forehead and extending over the eyes present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's headwear is traditional with a pearl or ornamental hair design instead of a black beaded mesh veil. This implies that there is no modern veil style typical of a gala event outfit. Thus, Image B does not feature a black beaded mesh veil.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases prominent earrings that appear to be multi-tiered, with dangling designs accented by pearls. The described ornate structure is visually confirmed as the earrings are detailed and complex in their design, corresponding to the question’s description.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features are blurred, which obscures the visibility of the subject's eyes, nose, and jawline. This makes it difficult to assess symmetry or the prominence of facial features accurately.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress features a traditional style common in historical paintings with an intricate ornamental design around the neckline area. The neckline is filled with pearls and embroidery, unlike the modern garment style featuring triangular spikes. Therefore, the gown does not have a deep V-neckline with triangular spikes.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's skin tone is presented in a style typical of classical paintings, with an even tone overall as visible in the hands and neck region. Such portraits often showcase a warm and consistent complexion without visible discoloration due to artistic choices. Consequently, the skin tone appears warm and evenly toned.",
