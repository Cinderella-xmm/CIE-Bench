      "question": "Are the eyes almond-shaped and positioned symmetrically on the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face is intentionally blurred, which renders it impossible to discern the shape or position of the eyes. Since the image does not provide the necessary visual information to determine the shape or symmetry of the eyes, the answer to this question is based purely on the inability to visually identify these features.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, clear visual cues indicate the presence of small hoop earrings worn on both ears, which are commonly identified by their circular form and metallic sheen, likely gold based on color.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's right hand is placed on the pants, giving the appearance of the hand being in the pocket with fingers visible, much like a casual pose often used to show the style of clothing with hands partially visible as a sign of relaxation.",
