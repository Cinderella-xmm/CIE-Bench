    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the conical, tiered structure composed of multiple horizontal levels stacked vertically preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure is clearly visible as a conical form with several horizontal layers stacked one over the other, resembling a Christmas tree-like design. This tiered stacking is a key feature of the structure, which is preserved from the concept of a tiered design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the teardrop-shaped chocolate droplets positioned at the center of each tier preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there is a central decorative element on each tier, these are more spherical and shiny, reflecting a metallic gold color, rather than the original teardrop shape. Thus, the shape and positioning of the teardrop-shaped chocolates are not directly preserved.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the chocolate pinecone-like structures supporting each tier preserved in their original form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents triangular chocolate elements that resemble a conical or pinecone texture which may serve a similar structural function, but these are differently styled compared to Image A's detailed pinecone-like structures. Therefore, they are not preserved in their original form.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the nuts (including almonds, pecans, and hazelnuts) visibly contained within the teardrop-shaped droplets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teardrop-shaped droplets from Image A containing nuts are replaced by golden spheres. There are no visible nuts like almonds, pecans, or hazelnuts inside them in the edited version. The alteration shifts the focus to a more abstract, decorative style without visible nuts.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wide, circular base with a horizontal band at its edge preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a wide, circular base similar to what is visible in Image A. The base features a prominent horizontal band with the label 'ChoConifer Delights,' suggesting the preservation of the concept of a decorative band around the base.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the overall color scheme dominated by deep brown tones with gold highlights preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color scheme predominantly features deep brown tones, typical for chocolate, alongside significant use of gold highlights, especially in the spherical decorative elements. This aligns with the preserved color scheme of Image A, emphasizing both chocolate hues and gold accents.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the teardrop-shaped droplets centrally aligned along the vertical axis of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central elements on each tier are spherical rather than teardrop-shaped, but they remain centrally aligned along the vertical axis, maintaining the symmetry and centralized focus of the original design. However, they are not teardrop-shaped.",
