      "question": "Is the shoji screen window with its grid of wooden frames and translucent paper panels present and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a minimalist design focused on promoting tea. There is no shoji screen visible; the background features a plain beige wall, possibly for a simpler promotional appearance. Image A has a shoji screen with wooden frames and translucent paper panels, a characteristic feature of a traditional Japanese setting.",

      "question": "Are the tatami mats with their woven texture and green border lines visible and unaltered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting is designed for advertisement purposes. There are no tatami mats visible; the background is a flat beige surface intended for simple promotional design. Image A, however, showcases tatami mats with their distinct woven texture and green border lines, typical of traditional Japanese interiors.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are maple leaves in autumnal colors (red, orange, yellow) visibly scattered across the tatami floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any maple leaves scattered across the floor. It maintains a clean and unembellished surface, typical of promotional posters, unlike Image A, which has a scattering of autumnal maple leaves over the tatami floor to enhance the seasonal theme.",

      "question": "Is the potted maple tree with bright red and yellow leaves visible in the upper right corner of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are autumn leaves visible in the design but they are part of the poster's illustration without a potted tree. The upper right corner features illustrated leaves as part of the decorative element. Image A includes a potted maple tree, contributing to the autumn theme within a traditional room setting.",

      "question": "Is the warm, diffused golden light coming through the shoji screen visible, creating soft shadows and highlights on the objects and floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses on promoting tea without elements of light diffusion typical of a traditional setting with shoji screens. The lighting is uniform for clarity in advertisement. In Image A, diffused golden light comes through the shoji screens, creating an ambient and warm atmosphere with soft shadows across the scene.",

      "question": "Is the tea tray placed centrally in front of the shoji screen, facing the autumnal view outside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a tea tray positioned centrally within the poster, but it does not display as positioned in front of any view or shoji screen; it appears in an abstract promotional setting. In Image A, the tea tray is placed centrally in front of the shoji screens, contributing to the cohesive theme between an interior setting and the autumn view outside.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, as a promotional poster, illustrates leaves but does not show any autumn forest and has removed the shoji screen element entirely. Image A showcases a blurred autumn forest visible through a shoji screen that sets a thematic backdrop filled with red and orange hues.",
