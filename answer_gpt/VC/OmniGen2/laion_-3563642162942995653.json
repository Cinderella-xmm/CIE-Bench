    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain exactly six wheels arranged in three axles, with the front axle near the cab and two rear axles supporting the cargo body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vehicle is depicted with transparent, emerald-like material, showing clear shapes and structures. The visual representation shows six wheels in three axles: the single-front axle near the cab and two rear axles under the cargo body, similar to military or transport trucks. This configuration remains the same as typical vehicle setup for heavy-duty trucks, which maintain stability and distribute weight evenly.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the cargo body positioned directly behind the cab, maintaining the same horizontal alignment and proportional length as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the cargo body is directly attached to the cab, in line horizontally without deviation, replicating realistic truck proportions. This is compared to industrial designs where the cargo section is adjacent to the driver's cab, maintaining uniform alignment for balance and efficient space use.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there two rectangular windows visible on the side of the cargo body, located approximately one-third and two-thirds along its length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two windows are visible on the side of the vehicle's cargo section. Their placement adheres to typical designs meant for ventilation and light within cargo or service vehicles. These are strategically placed at about one-third and two-thirds along the length of the cargo body, denoting a balanced distribution visually and structurally.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the vertical slatted grille present on the front of the vehicle, centered between the headlights and aligned with the hood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vertical slatted grille is depicted centrally located on the vehicle's front section, positioned between the headlights, aligning with the common design of military or classic trucks where such grilles serve functional (ventilation) and aesthetic (design symmetry) purposes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a side mirror attached to the driver’s side door, extending outward from the upper portion of the door?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On Image B, the side mirror is evident as it protrudes from the upper part of the driver's side door. This positioning maximizes the driver's rear visibility, which is customary in truck design to ensure safety and operational efficiency.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a horizontal ladder affixed to the lower side of the cargo body, running parallel to the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B doesn't show a ladder fixed on the lower side parallel to the ground. Instead, the vehicle has a smooth lower line without such equipment visibly present. This indicates a design deviation from functionalities executed for storage or simple aesthetic continuity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a silver-colored door handle visible on the driver’s side door, positioned midway down the door?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the emerald materialization of the object, traditional distinctions like silver-coloring are not perceivable. However, a handle is modeled in a typical mid-door position, common for optimal ease of access, but without visible color traits like silver, it generally takes on a transparent green hue.",
