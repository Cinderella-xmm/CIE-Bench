      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parrot inside the glass dome clearly has its head and chest covered with bright red feathers.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings of the parrot show a distinct pattern composed of blue, green, and yellow feathers. This coloration is typical for many tropical parrots and may indicate a species like the Scarlet Macaw. The arrangement of these colors stands out in contrast to the reds of the parrot, making them noticeable.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parrot is upright on the branch, and its posture gives the impression of stability and confidence. The parrot's head is oriented in such a way that it faces the viewer, which is often interpreted as the parrot interacting with its environment, especially within its enclosed glass setting.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The branch in Image B, where the parrot is perched, is bare of moss. Instead, it is surrounded by green leaves inside a glass dome. This contrasts the natural, moss-covered branch typically found in wild settings.",
      "weight": 2,

      "explanation": "The parrot in Image B has an eye that features a dark pupil and is surrounded by white facial skin. However, the eye itself in this representation does not appear yellow; this may be a stylistic choice or limited by the digital illustration's detailing capabilities.",

      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no green moss on the branch where the parrot is perched. The environment inside the glass dome does not include moss, focusing instead on smooth branches and decorative elements. This absence is clear due to the controlled and polished setting within the dome.",
