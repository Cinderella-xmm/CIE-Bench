        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image B, the girl is depicted with a short, straight black bob hairstyle. The visual cues confirm the retention of this hairstyle style from the original image. The color and cut are distinctly visible and unchanged.",

        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image B, the girl is shown holding her hands in front of her chest without the red flower, which is visible in image A. This indicates that the flower is no longer present in the edited version.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image B no longer features the setting of vendor trays arranged in an alleyway, which is a significant element in image A. Instead, the image is a graphic design featuring balloons, which does not reflect the previous arrangement.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image B has transformed the entire scene into a graphic design and doesn't include the vertical banners with Japanese calligraphy that were visible in Image A. It features stylized elements unrelated to the original setting.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the girl positioned centrally in the alleyway between the two rows of trays in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the girl in Image B is indeed positioned centrally within the frame, the context of being in an alleyway between two rows of trays, as seen in Image A, is missing due to the switched graphic design context.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image B completely alters the previous setting. It features balloons within a graphic design and does not show the multiple hanging objects aligned in rows above the alleyway, which are visible in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Are there seated figures behind the trays on both sides of the alley in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image B does not feature any human figures or the alley setting with vendor trays; therefore, the seated figures in Image A are absent in Image B's graphic representation.",
