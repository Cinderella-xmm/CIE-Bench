    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the large tree trunk with textured bark positioned on the left side of the image, partially obscuring the rear wheel of the bicycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the large tree trunk is indeed positioned on the left side of the image, closely tied to the visual cue of a tree having clear texture on its bark, likely obscuring part of the bicycles and motorbikes on the left side, corroborated by common foliage structures. The trunk is not obscuring the rear wheel of any bike or motorbike within Image B as per visual analysis.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the bicycle make direct contact with the tree trunk, leaning against it on its left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycles depicted are riding independently into the scene, not making contact or leaning against any tree trunk, as the foliage and tree trunks serve as decorative backgrounds rather than actionably involved elements.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a continuous road stretching from the foreground into the background, aligned horizontally across the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a road stretching from foreground to background, aligned mostly horizontally due to the path layout, based on the observed travel of bicycles and motorbikes giving an impression of a continuous road stretching across the scene.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there exactly three motorcyclists riding in a straight line along the road in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of moving singular bicycles is apparent and a distinct group of other transport vehicles are absent, proving alignment and placement solely of singular bike riders rather than any linear motorcyclist positioning.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the bicycle located on the left side of the image, with the road and motorcyclists positioned to the right and extending into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bicycles, in animated format, dominate the scene from foreground into central aspects, with no bias towards left side presence concerning road and motorcyclists extending into scene completes horizontally across the textured background.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the rear wheel of the bicycle partially obscured by the tree trunk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of bicycles riding independtently away from the tree trunks does not allow for an obscured wheel scenario, pointing instead towards an illustrative journey rather than an existent stationary position where a wheel may be obscured.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a round headlight mounted on the front fork of the bicycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animated style of bicycles reflects simplified components that do not distinctly illustrate the fine details such as headlights or fork apparatus as accentuated in traditional bike setups, providing no indication of a round headlight presence.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
