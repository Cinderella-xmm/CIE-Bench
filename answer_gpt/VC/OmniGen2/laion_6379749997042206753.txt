    "Question": "Q1: Is the brand name 'Karls' clearly visible on the label of the jar?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the label on the jar shows a logo with green text, which is common for brand names. However, instead of displaying 'Karls', the label has a different logo that doesn't correspond to the original brand. This suggests an intentional alteration to make the label distinct from the original.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the text 'Pumpkin Spice Popcorn' present on the label of the jar?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays 'Pumpkin Spise Paon' on the label, which is similar but deliberately distorted from the original 'Pumpkin Spice Popcorn'. The non-standard spelling implies an edited or satirical version.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the popcorn contained in a clear glass jar with a silver metal lid?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction is more of a cartoon illustration, and the jar is animated and stylized rather than intricately detailed like real glass. It lacks the realistic elements that typically indicate glass material.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a white ceramic bowl with a blue rim containing popped popcorn?",

    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are unpopped corn kernels visible in a separate clear jar?",

}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the dominant colors of the labels and popcorn orange and brown?",
    "explanation": "Image B uses vibrant orange prominently on the label and background, but does not feature brown as a primary color. It exaggerates the orange tone suitable for a seasonal theme, thus differing from the realistic version in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the scene set on a wooden surface?",

}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Are unpopped or popped popcorn kernels scattered on the surface around the jars?",
    "explanation": "Image B uses scattered popcorn as part of its animated theme, showing popcorn floating around creatively. While it doesn't directly depict kernels on a surface, the loose popcorn in the image mimics the scattered effect in a stylized manner.",
    "answer": "Yes"
