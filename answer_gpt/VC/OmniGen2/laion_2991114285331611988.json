    {

      "question": "Is the plaid pattern (with red, blue, and black intersecting lines) on the left tie preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a plaid pattern is visible on the tie, consisting of intersecting red, blue, and black lines. This pattern aligns with the description provided in the question. By analyzing the visual cues, such as the shapes and colors of lines, one can confidently deduce that the plaid pattern is the same as mentioned.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the green and yellow bear-shaped emblem on the right tie preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display a green and yellow bear-shaped emblem on the tie. The suit depicted on the person on the right illustrates a solid color without detailed ornamental elements. Hence, based on common recognition of emblems, the emblem is not preserved in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are both ties preserved in their original necktie shape (narrow, tapered, diagonal across the chest)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both ties retain their narrow and tapered form, identifiable by their angular, diagonal positioning across the chest of the figures. This maintains the classic necktie shape, allowing the deduction that their original form is preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the figure with the plaid tie on the left side of the image, and the figure with the emblem on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure on the left side is wearing a plaid tie, while the figure on the right side is similarly placed but does not show a bear emblem. This aligns with the placement but not the presence of the emblem. Thus, considering only their positions leads to a confirmation of their left-right arrangement.",

      "question": "Is the background a grassy field with visible green vegetation extending into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image portrays a grassy field as evidenced by the uniform green color and vegetative patterns extending into the distance. The simplified background drawing in Image B reflects the expansive nature of a typical grassy landscape. Such depiction in animation often involves representing fields with minimal detailed vegetation, leading to the conclusion regarding the landscape in Image B.",
