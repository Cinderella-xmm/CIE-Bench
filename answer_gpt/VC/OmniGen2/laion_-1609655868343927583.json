      "question": "Is the herringbone wood inlay pattern present on the surface of the transformed character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the character (formerly the cabinet) has a decorative design that resembles an ornate costume or armor rather than the original wood inlay pattern. The herringbone pattern, which is very specific and identifiable by its V-shaped weaving, is not visible. Instead, the surface of the character is designed with intricate floral or symbolic motifs that are different from the original texture seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the circular brass ring pulls and adjacent escutcheons present on the transformed character’s waist area, matching their original positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's 'waist' area does feature decorative elements reminiscent of drawer pulls. However, these elements are not identical to the original circular brass ring pulls and escutcheons arrangement found in Image A. The design in Image B appears to mirror the historic or royal theme of the character, rather than replicating the exact positioning and style of the original hardware.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the transformed character retain the original warm amber-brown wood color as the base tone of its body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base tone of Image B, which serves as the core color of the character's body, appears to maintain a similar warm and rich amber-brown color consistent with the wood tone in Image A. This suggests a retained visual connection in terms of color palette between the original and transformed states.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the transformed character’s feet retain small brass caps at their ends, corresponding to the original leg caps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's feet are styled as bird-like talons, which show no presence of brass caps akin to those on the original cabinet's legs in Image A. The imaginative transformation into talons replaces the original design element of capped legs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the legs of the transformed character still tapered, narrowing from top to bottom, consistent with the original cabinet legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character's legs in Image B are transformed into non-tapered, clawed feet, resembling bird talons. This is a significant departure from the original tapered legs of the cabinet in Image A. The transformed character does not retain this specific tapering feature.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the two drawers/pouches positioned vertically one above the other on the transformed character, maintaining their original stacking order?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two 'drawers' maintain a vertical arrangement, positioned one above the other, corresponding to how the drawers of the cabinet were originally arranged in Image A. This stacked order is preserved in their transformed state.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the brass foliate motif visible on the side of the transformed character’s torso, in the same location as the original cabinet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the transformed image, the detailed brass foliate motifs that adorned the original cabinet sides are not visible. Instead, the character design in Image B focuses on clothing-like decorations, with no clear evidence of the specific brass foliate motif in those same positions.",
      "weight": 1,

      "question": "Does the crown portion of the transformed character retain the original semi-circular edge shape of the marble top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformed character in Image B wears a crown, which does not mimic the semi-circular edge shape of the original marble top seen in Image A. Instead, the crown is distinctly round with ornate jewels, deviating from the semi-circular form.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Do the transformed pouches retain a dark interior, suggesting depth and openness, consistent with the original drawer interiors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the interior of the pouches, in their drawer-like form, maintains a dark color that implies a sense of depth and openness, similar to the original dark interior of the drawers in Image A.",
