    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the central character (derived from the green block) positioned exactly in the middle of the composition, surrounded by other characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green block character is positioned prominently in the center, surrounded by red block characters. This arrangement suggests the central positioning of the green character within the group.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the characters derived from the blocks retain the circular stud pattern on their upper surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The characters in Image B appear to maintain the circular stud pattern typical of block toys, visible on the top surfaces of both the green and red characters, which aligns with the traditional construction block characteristics.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the characters derived from the blocks primarily composed of rectangular or boxy shapes, preserving the original block geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The characters seen in Image B are constructed with boxy, rectangular forms that align with the block geometry, reflecting the shape and structure commonly associated with block toys.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the composition filled with a dense cluster of characters (originally blocks), arranged in a piled, overlapping manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a tidy arrangement of characters placed together but not in a dense cluster or piled fashion. Each character is clearly visible and distinct from others, as opposed to Image A's piled arrangement of blocks.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there only one character (derived from the green block) that differs in color or design from the surrounding characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central green block character stands out due to its distinct color from the surrounding red characters, indicating it is the only one that differs in this regard.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the characters derived from the blocks retain any visual indication of interlocking mechanisms (such as recessed areas or connectors)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B displays the studded top surfaces typical of blocks, it does not show recessed areas or connectors that signify interlocking mechanisms, thus the absence of these features.",
      "weight": 1,
