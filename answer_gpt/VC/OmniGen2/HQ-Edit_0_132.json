    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there exactly three human figures in the scene, positioned respectively in the foreground, on a small island in the lake, and on the far left bank?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are three human figures visible. They are all positioned on the foreground bank; no figure is situated separately on a small island or the far left bank as they are standing together reading and gesturing towards something off-image. This indicates the scene lacks distinct foreground, island, and far-left placements.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the foreground figure depicted in a dynamic Tai Chi pose with one arm extended upward and the other hand forming a circular or open palm gesture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the figures standing upright in a calm and stationary posture, holding or reading a scroll or script. There is no dynamic pose or Tai Chi indication like raised arms or open palm gestures characteristic of such an activity.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are multiple pink lotus flowers clearly visible among large green lily pads in the foreground of the lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed multiple pink lotus flowers, and large green lily pads are present, primarily visible on the right and left sides, contributing to the scenery around the figures near the water's edge.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "question": "Are there tall willow trees with long, vertically hanging green fronds on both the left and right sides of the lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features tall willow trees with long vertically hanging green fronds visible on the left side of the scene, providing a classic lush environment, although the right side is not depicted with such trees in view.",
      "weight": 2,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a calm body of water in the center of the scene, reflecting the surrounding trees and sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does show a body of water, yet it appears calmer and less reflective than in Image A due to the misty ambiance and somewhat more stylized representation. The reflections are implied rather than overtly clear.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there clusters of pink flowering plants growing along the grassy slope on the left side of the lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible clusters of pink flowering plants specifically outlined on a grassy slope. Instead, the figures are encased with a lot of greenery, and pink lotus flowers appear beside them but not in the form of ground clusters on a slope.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a mountain range visible in the background, shrouded in mist and located behind the lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does depict a mountain range in the background, partially covered in a misty ambiance which enhances the scene's depth behind the lake. This adds to the serene, distant vista commonly associated with such landscapes.",
