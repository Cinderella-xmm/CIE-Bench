      "question": "Is the facial moko kauae tattoo pattern with symmetrical spirals and angular lines clearly visible and intact, covering the forehead, cheeks, and chin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face is blurred, and as such, the tattoo pattern, if present, cannot be clearly observed. The tattoo typically features symmetrical and angular designs on the face, but the blurring obstructs this detail.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moko patterns on the chest, shoulders, and upper arms are clearly visible and feature the expected continuous swirling and curved motifs that match traditional moko tattoo designs. This consistency in visible design indicates that intricate patterns are indeed present.",

      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the piupiu skirt is depicted with layered, light brown strands resembling dried flax that hang in distinct tiers. It is secured by a woven belt featuring a central element that resembles a metallic buckle. This matches the description provided.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leg wraps are visible on both lower legs, reaching mid-calf, and feature a shaggy appearance similar to the texture of the piupiu skirt, indicating that the attire is cohesive.",

      "question": "Is the warrior positioned in a wide haka stance with knees bent, arms extended outward at shoulder height, and fingers splayed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the warrior in a stance with knees bent and arms slightly extended, although not fully at shoulder height. The fingers are also not clearly splayed. Therefore, the pose partially resembles a haka but not entirely.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background composed of steep, densely vegetated mountain slopes forming a deep valley with visible mist rising between them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is stylized and consists of green mountain slopes that characteristically descend into a valley. However, the simple stylization does not depict steep or densely vegetated slopes, nor is there a visible presence of mist as one would expect with such topographical features.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground, styled illustratively, shows the warrior standing on a green patch, but it does not exhibit detailed features of a large, moss-covered rock or render visible texture and shadow beneath the feet as typically observed in realistic depictions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground is vastly simplified in illustrative style and lacks the naturalistic detail required to depict harakeke plants distinctly, eliminating their visibility in this edited composition.",
