      "question": "Are the silver blades still visibly reflective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blades are illustrated as black and white lines without any reflections or metallic sheen. This lack of reflectivity is noted as the drawing uses solid colors that do not convey any reflective quality. In contrast, reflectivity is typically represented in illustrations by using gradients or highlights, neither of which appear in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the golden handles still show a polished finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handles are illustrated with solid black and white, which does not exhibit any visual cues indicative of a polished metallic finish, such as highlights or glossiness. Typically, a polished finish is conveyed through reflections and shine, which are absent in this simplistic illustration.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the open V-shape configuration of the blades preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The open V-shape configuration is a structural aspect of scissors and is clearly depicted in the illustration of Image B through the crossing of the blades. The overall positioning of the blades forming a 'V' shape is maintained in the drawing.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background still a uniform dark gray?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is solid white, which is a significant change from the uniform dark gray background found in Image A. The white background provides a stark contrast to the black lines of the illustration.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the edges of the blades still clean and sharp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration maintains the integrity of the scissors' edges by using crisp, defined black lines to depict the blade edges. The absence of jaggedness or irregularities in the line work implies that the edges remain clean and sharp in appearance.",
