      "question": "Does the giraffe retain its characteristic brown polygonal spots on a cream-colored base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffe has distinct brown polygonal spots placed on a cream-colored base, which are typical features of a giraffe's natural pattern. This observation matches the typical giraffe coat seen in both realistic animal depictions and plush toys. Therefore, the observation of clear polygonal spots combined with world knowledge of giraffe patterns confidently confirms this characteristic.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffe has two small, rounded structures on its head, consistent with the ossicones seen in giraffes. Ossicones are bony projections covered with skin, commonly found on giraffes. The visual details and positioning on top of the head confirm their presence.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The giraffe in Image B indeed has dark, large eyes that are commonly depicted in toy designs to give a friendly appearance. Additionally, the mouth appears slightly upturned, suggesting a gentle expression. These features align with common toy design practices for friendly and approachable animal figures.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the giraffe standing upright, showcasing its full structure from head to hooves. While the exact position relative to a room’s center cannot be determined due to the different background context, it is clear that the giraffe is vertically upright within the perspective of the packaging.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the giraffe suggests a plush texture by showing smooth and evenly distributed fur-like surface typical in children's plush toys. The visual portrayal gives the impression of softness, a common design choice for toys to enhance tactile friendliness.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffe's ears are shown with a rounded shape, positioned symmetrically on either side of the head. This symmetry and shape are typical of giraffe anatomy and replicated accurately in toy designs to reflect real-life animal features.",
