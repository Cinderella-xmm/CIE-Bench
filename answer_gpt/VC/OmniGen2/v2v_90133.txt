    "Question": "Q1: Is the background a uniform beige color without any gradient, pattern, or texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to be a consistent beige color without any visible gradients, patterns, or textures. The uniformity of the background color can be observed as it remains constant around the subject, suggesting that it has been intentionally set to be uniform without any additional design elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the background have no visible texture, grain, or surface variation?",
    "explanation": "From the observation of Image B, the background displays a flat and smooth appearance without any noticeable texture, grain, or surface variation. This suggests that the background was designed to be smooth and untextured, maintaining a plain and unobtrusive look.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there no shadows, reflections, or light variations on the background surface?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a subject on a background, and it is noted that there are no discernible shadows or reflections cast on the background. Similarly, there is a lack of light variation indicating that the lighting was evenly distributed, avoiding the creation of shadows or reflections on the background surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the image framed with straight edges and no border or crop distortion?",
    "explanation": "The framing of Image B appears with straight edges, and there is no visible distortion or misalignment in the borders of the image. This suggests that the image has been cropped correctly without any warping, skewing, or irregular border presentations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the lighting on the background evenly distributed with no hotspots or directional shadows?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is consistent across the entire background, showing no signs of hotspots or directional shadows. The evenness of the lighting ensures that the background remains uniform in color and brightness, which is indicative of well-distributed lighting conditions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
