      "question": "Are the stone steps beneath the character present and textured with visible cracks and moss-like details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone steps beneath the character are indeed visible and are textured with what appears to be cracks and moss-like details, giving them a weathered and aged appearance. This conclusion is drawn by observing the distinct lines and shading variations that suggest such textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there an arched window with vertical iron bars visible in the background behind the character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an arched window in the background that features vertical lines resembling iron bars. This observation is based on the visible structure and pattern of the window, which resembles common architectural designs in older buildings.",

      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, dark, twisting vines with dried leaves are present, covering the walls and archways around the character. This is deduced from the visual depiction of intertwining lines and leaf shapes, which are typical of creeping plants.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are small, round, multicolored objects scattered on the stone steps which resemble candies. This identification is made by considering the shape, size, and varied colors of these objects.",

      "question": "Is the character sitting cross-legged on the steps with her hands near her chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is not depicted sitting cross-legged. Instead, the character is seated in what appears to be a more conventional pose with hands resting by the side. Thus, the description of cross-legged sitting with hands near the chest does not apply here.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the object replacement consistent with original placement: sewing kit and porcelain figurine on the left, oil lamp on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the left side features a basket of candy with a black cat, while in Image B, there is a porcelain figurine. On the right side, the pumpkin with a glowing face in Image A is replaced by a pumpkin in Image B, which has no light. The sewing kit replacement is inferred to be the box present but not directly in the same placement. Object placements are thus altered, not consistent, especially with the oil lamp inferred to replace light sources without glow. Thus, the replacement is not consistent.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the oil lamp emit a warm, golden glow that illuminates the surrounding area, similar to the original pumpkin’s light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a lit candle beside a pumpkin and a porcelain figurine emitting a warm glow which partially illuminates the surrounding area. Unlike the original glowing pumpkin in Image A that offers more area-specific illumination, this light is limited to near-surface lighting. Thus, the candlelight captures a similar ambiance but not as extensive as the pumpkin’s glow in image A.",
