      "question": "Does the edited image retain the large ears and trunk shape of the elephant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a cartoon elephant character with notably large ears and a prominent trunk. This characteristic is visually evident as the ears are proportionally large compared to its body, and the trunk is a distinct feature protruding from its face. In many depictions of elephants, these features are common and recognizable traits. Therefore, the edited image does retain these key elephant features.",

      "question": "Is the hat placed on top of the elephant's head and the collar around its neck in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the elephant is wearing a hat on top of its head, which is a common position for a hat on a character, suggesting it's dressed in a playful, circus-like fashion. Additionally, the image features a collar around the elephant's neck, depicted in bright colors that match the cheerful theme. These visual elements are clear and consistent with a circus elephant or a performer style.",

      "question": "Are the eyes of the elephant black in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image of the elephant character shows that its eyes are indeed black. This is visually conveyed by the solid black color used for the eyes, which is a typical choice for cartoon and chibi-style illustrations where simplicity is key and the eyes are often large and expressive.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the elephant facing forward in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the elephant standing on a stage facing directly forward. This is evident from the symmetrical positioning of the ears, eyes, and the direction of the trunk. In illustrations, a forward-facing character is often depicted in this manner to engage with the viewer directly.",

      "question": "Does the overall shape of the elephant in the edited image resemble the original block-style model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows an elephant in a smooth, cartoon style with rounded shapes and detailed features, such as shading and a background, which contrasts with the original block-style model that features a more angular and geometric shape due to its construction from blocks akin to a toy figure. The two styles are fundamentally different in construction and aesthetics, thereby not resembling each other.",
