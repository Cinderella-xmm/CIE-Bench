      "question": "Is the portrait of the gentleman contained within an oval shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surrounding shape containing the image of the gentleman is clearly an oval, as indicated by smoothly rounded edges that form a continuous curve with no corners. This aligns with the typical characteristics of an oval shape.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the gentleman in a side view (profile) with his head oriented towards the left side of the frame. This is apparent from the visual information, as typical profile views show the side of the face, usually highlighting the outline of the ear, nose, and jaw.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a piece of clothing around the gentleman’s neck tied in a manner that resembles a bow, which is consistent with how a cravat is often styled. The structure and tying technique are visually similar to a traditional cravat, often adorned with a bow-like knot.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gentleman in Image B is depicted with dark hair, visible sideburns extending in front of the ear, but the portrayal lacks a mustache. The hair is neatly styled and sideburns are common in historical portraiture, but no mustache is present in this image.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gentleman is shown wearing an upper garment that appears to be a coat covering his shoulders and extending down to the upper back, as indicated by the way the clothing drapes and the parts of the body it conceals. This is typical of a coat or jacket.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gentleman’s head is shown in profile orientation, typically revealing the outline of features like the nose, jawline, and often an eye. However, due to the angle and layout, the complete visibility of these features on the right side is not evident.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
