      "question": "Is the central floral medallion located on the front center of the body, surrounded by symmetrical scrollwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the object features a central area on the container where a label can be seen instead of a floral medallion. This label is not surrounded by symmetrical scrollwork but rather is situated within a lattice-like pattern on the container. The absence of such symmetrical scrollwork around a central floral medallion in the edited image indicates the answer is No.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the spout extend from the left side of the body with a curled, scroll-like tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain a teapot with a spout. Instead, it shows a glass container with a lid that resembles a decorative ornament. There is no spout present in the design, so the existence of a curled, scroll-like tip is not applicable to this object.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the handle on the right side of the body shaped like a C with ornate volute ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a glass container with a lid. There is no handle present on the object shown in Image B, thus there is no C-shaped handle with ornate volute ends.",

      "question": "Is there a small decorative finial atop the lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass container has a lid that features a small decorative finial at the top. This is evident by the ornate design found on the top center of the lid, commonly seen in luxury or antique items, confirming the presence of such a feature.",

      "question": "Are there four ornate feet supporting the base of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the object in Image B is a marble platform supporting a glass container. There are no visible feet, ornate or otherwise, as the container sits directly on a flat surface. The design is solid and continuous rather than elevated by feet.",

      "question": "Are the floral and foliate patterns arranged symmetrically around the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass container features a lattice-like pattern on its surface rather than floral and foliate motifs. This pattern is more geometric and not arranged in a floral or foliate manner that suggests symmetry around the body typical of teapots and similar items. Therefore, the answer regarding this specific detail is No.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the object retain the same overall rounded silhouette with a domed lid and balanced spout and handle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B retains a rounded silhouette due to the shape of the glass container and its lid. However, it does not have a spout or handle as seen in typical teapots. While the lid has a slight dome due to the decorative finial, the absence of a spout and handle alters the balance observed in teapots. Hence, the description doesn't completely fit the edited image's object.",
