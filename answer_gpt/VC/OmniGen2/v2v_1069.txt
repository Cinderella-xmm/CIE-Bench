    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the original four blades of the ceiling fan?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image shows a fan inside a snow globe with four blades, similar to a typical ceiling fan. This fan has maintained the standard number of four blades. The general structure, including blade count, resembles that of traditional ceiling fans, which commonly have four to five blades for balance and efficiency. Therefore, the image retains the original four blades.",
    "answer": "yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the central hub structure of the ceiling fan still present in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the fan within the snow globe includes a central hub, which is the rounded part to which all blades are attached. This is typical in ceiling fans, as the hub houses the motor and connects all the blades. Therefore, the central hub structure is maintained in the edited image.",
    "answer": "yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the edited image preserve the metallic texture and color scheme of the ceiling fan?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a fan that appears to have a metallic texture, with a reflective surface typical of metals, and it retains similar color characteristics to those found in Image A's ceiling fan. The hue and sheen suggest metal, consistent with typical fan materials like stainless steel or brushed nickel. Hence, the metallic texture and color scheme are preserved.",
    "answer": "yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the blades arranged symmetrically around the central hub in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the fan blades are evenly spaced around the central hub, maintaining symmetrical distribution. This symmetrical arrangement is a common engineering choice in fan design to ensure balanced rotation and effective airflow. Therefore, yes, the blades are symmetrically arranged around the central hub in the edited image.",
    "answer": "yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the connection points between the blades and the central hub visible in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the connection points where each fan blade connects to the central hub can be seen clearly. Each blade appears to be attached individually at distinct locations around the hub, which is a standard design for both functionality and aesthetic appeal. Therefore, these connection points are visible in the edited image.",
    "answer": "yes"
