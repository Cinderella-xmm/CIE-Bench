    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there exactly four rotor assemblies arranged symmetrically around the central body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, I observe a drone with four rotor assemblies, each attached to an arm extending from the central body. The rotor assemblies are evenly spaced around the central body, indicating symmetrical arrangement which is a common feature in quadcopter designs. This setup typically provides stability and balance during flight.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there yellow triangular markings present on the top and side surfaces of the central body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a drone that has several yellow markings on the central body. These markings are triangular in shape and are placed strategically on the top and sides of the central structure. Yellow accents are often used for stylistic purposes or visibility against predominantly dark colors such as black.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the landing supports shaped like V-forms at each corner of the drone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection of Image B, the drone features landing supports that appear to extend downward from the rotor arms. These supports are angled in a manner that resembles a wide V-shape, implying that they are designed to provide stability upon landing by distributing the drone's weight evenly.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the central body feature sharp, angular edges and a polygonal structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The drone depicted in Image B possesses a central body characterized by sharp, angular edges, forming a distinct polygonal shape. This design is aligned with modern aesthetic and aerodynamic principles, enhancing the drone's visual appeal and possibly its performance by reducing wind resistance.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there three small rectangular lights aligned horizontally on the top surface of the central body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the visual cues do not indicate any presence of small rectangular lights on the top surface of the central body. The surface is devoid of such features, displaying only the colored markings and the sleek material of the drone body itself.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the drone predominantly black with yellow accent markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The drone in Image B is primarily black, consistent with the common color scheme for many drone designs that blend stealthiness and style. The presence of yellow accent markings adds contrast and visual interest, reaffirming the description of the drone being predominantly black with yellow accents.",
