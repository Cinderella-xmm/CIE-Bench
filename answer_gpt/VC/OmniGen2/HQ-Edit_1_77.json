      "question": "Is the multi-layered beaded neckpiece composed of alternating red, white, blue, and black horizontal bands still present in the same layered structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neckpiece shows a clear multi-layered design with horizontal bands of different colors, including red, white, and blue. The black appears to form a thin line between other colors, maintaining a consistent pattern. The recognition of a layered structure is based on the continuity and repetition of these colors, which create distinct visual bands. Comparing with Image A, both images show the same layered structure. This analysis utilizes the visual aspect combined with knowledge of traditional neckpiece designs, which often include alternating colored bands to create a visually appealing pattern.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clearly visible red vertical thread or beaded element extending downward from the center of the multilayer neckpiece, which is a common traditional design element that serves to enhance symmetry and visual interest.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the headband is characterized by its blue-and-white beaded appearance and position across the forehead.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features red bead-like elements integrated into the hair, creating a striking visual contrast against the dark hair and enhancing the cultural and traditional motif of the image.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible bracelets on the forearms that exhibit a pattern consistent with the necklace's color scheme (red, white, blue).
