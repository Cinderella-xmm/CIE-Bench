      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the roll-top closure secured by two vertical brown leather straps positioned symmetrically on the front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the backpack features two vertical brown leather straps that are symmetrically placed, running down from the top towards the buckle area, effectively securing the roll-top closure in the center. This symmetry is evident from their equal spacing from the backpack's center line, which is typical for securing roll-top closures.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a central snap button closure on the front flap of the backpack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show a central snap button on the front flap of the backpack. Instead, the closure mechanism relies on the vertical brown leather straps with buckles. The absence of a central button, which would typically be used for easy opening and closing, suggests a design focus on leather straps for securing the flap.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed two side pockets visible, one on each side of the backpack. Both pockets are accented with brown leather trim, suggesting a consistent design theme and additional style and durability. This matches the common design where side pockets are emphasized for extra storage.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a rectangular leather brand patch can be seen in the lower right section of the front panel of the backpack. It is a common place for brand representation, which helps in easy identification of brand detail while being consistent with the elegant leather theme of the bag.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible metal D-rings attached to the bottom corners of the backpack. The bottom area seems to be clear of such attachments, indicating a focus on a clean design without these additional metal loops for external attachments or hanging.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoulder straps are designed symmetrically, with each strap emerging from equal distances from the centerline of the backpack's top. This ensures a balanced weight distribution for the wearer and is typical for backpacks to enhance comfort.",

The design instead highlights smooth lines and seams possibly covered or seamlessly integrated into the backpack fabric, supporting a sleek appearance without visible stitching.",
