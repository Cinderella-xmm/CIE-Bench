      "question": "Are the two cylindrical corner towers still present at the left and right ends of the castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the castle appears enclosed within a snow globe. It features cylindrical towers similar to those of a castle, but it's not clear if they are at the ends as it is a stylized version and doesn't follow the exact proportions or structure of a real-life castle. Analyzing Image A shows that it originally had two cylindrical corner towers. Therefore, within the snow globe context, the design doesn't explicitly show these towers at the ends in the intended context, likely due to it being a miniaturized and stylized representation.",

      "question": "Do the two central square turrets with pointed finials remain atop the central section of the castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B within the snow globe shows a stylized castle with towers and pointed finials, but there is a distinct artistic difference from the original realistic structure in Image A. Image A shows the castle with square turrets with pointed finials. In Image B, while there are turrets and finials, they do not exactly replicate those in Image A and their arrangement differs significantly as the representation is meant to be more fanciful.",

      "question": "Is the large central arched entranceway still present and centrally aligned with the pathway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe contains a central entranceway as seen in stylized castles. By examining the artistic design, it aligns with the pathway within the globe. When similarly analyzing Image A, the large arched entranceway is at the center, aligned with the pathway leading toward it. The key difference is due to the stylization rather than a direct architectural rendering, affecting alignment perception slightly.",

      "question": "Are the arched windows and openings arranged symmetrically across the front facade of the castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a highly stylized and simplified version of the castle, featuring fewer openings and windows, primarily focusing on visual impact rather than architectural fidelity, lacking consistent symmetrical placement. Image A exhibits these elements precisely, maintaining symmetrical arrangement that is typical of traditional Gothic architecture.",

      "question": "Is the castle still constructed from dark gray and reddish-brown stone blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the castle encapsulated within the snow globe exhibits colors more associated with a typical European fairytale castle rather than realistic material colors. It appears sandy-beige, diverging from the original earthier tones of Image A's dark gray and reddish-brown stone blocks.",

      "question": "Is the upper portion of the castle still open to the sky, revealing the lack of a roof and internal framework?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a fully enclosed castle with a roof, capped with typical turret tops and a complete structure. Image A shows an abandoned ruin with the upper portion exposed to the sky without a roof or visible internal frameworks, reflecting its abandoned state. The snow globe's complete rendering indicates a closed structure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central entranceway within the snow globe design aligns symmetrically with the pathway depicted, consistent with miniature castle displays. Similarly, Image A has its entranceway aligned centrally along the gravel path. Despite stylization, the core alignment principle is maintained in both depictions.",
