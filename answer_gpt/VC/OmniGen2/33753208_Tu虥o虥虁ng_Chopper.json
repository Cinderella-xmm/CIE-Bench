    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the small structure with a blue roof still present at the highest point of the ridge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there is no distinct removal or alteration of the far ridge where the structure with a blue roof was located. Although obscured by the dragon, the structure still appears to be present. By examining the limits of the visible region, the structure remains unaffected at the highest point of the ridge.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the hikers still visible along the central trail, maintaining their original positions relative to the path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observation of the edited image, the hikers are no longer visible on the path. The large dragon overshadows the path's central area, obscuring the hikers who were initially present in the original image. This indicates a removal or blocking of visibility due to the dragon.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the ridge maintain its original undulating shape, forming a continuous elevated backbone from foreground to background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the second image, the ridge does maintain its undulating shape as seen previously. Despite the dragon's presence, the ridge's backbone of continuous elevation is unaltered, running smoothly from foreground to background without disruptions.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image maintains the original locations and densities of the vegetation on the ridge slopes. The dragon does not appear to affect or alter the positioning or density of the flora, implying the trees and shrubs are unchanged.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the sky maintains a similar overcast nature, with a soft diffused lighting that matches the original image's tone. There are no clear alterations to the sky's texture or lighting, allowing for the same atmosphere.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a distinct transformation in the grassy areas along the path; the texture and color have been altered. The grass has adopted a more fantastical appearance due to the dragon's presence, showing changes in hue and possibly edited texture.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the distant hills still visible in the background, fading into mist as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
