      "question": "Does the edited image contain exactly four suitcases?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual inspection reveals three suitcases: two at the bottom, both rectangular in shape, and a blue duffel bag on top of the two round anthropomorphic figures. World knowledge and context indicate the same number as Image A, despite the addition of human-like figures. The key observation is on the type and number of suitcases, all of which align to total three, not four.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the suitcases stacked in the same order from bottom to top: two rectangular, one round, one duffel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows suitcases stacked in a different order. While two rectangular suitcases are at the bottom, they have anthropomorphic figures on top instead of a round suitcase. The duffel is then placed on top of the figures, demonstrating a rearranged stacking order, confirming knowledge that it's different from Image A's pattern.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the third suitcase from the bottom clearly round in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the third suitcase from the bottom is identified as a blue duffel bag, evident from its shape and visual features such as the strap. The figures in between the bottom two suitcases and the duffel bag visually differ from a round suitcase, using visual familiarity and recognition of typical round suitcase designs.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the figure positioned to the right of the luggage stack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, there are multiple figures placed centrally between suitcases on the left and right side of the visual frame. Using spatial recognition and position awareness, the human-like figure in the middle isn't solely to the right side of the stack, which contrasts Image A's positioning.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the figure depicted in side profile, facing left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figures in the edited image are facing directly forward as part of the display, with no indication to suggest a side profile or left-facing direction. The analysis uses character orientation understanding and spatial arrangement in displays to discern they face forward, differing from the side profile evidenced in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the suitcases rest directly on top of one another in a stable vertical stack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows suitcases placed separate from one another, contrasted by the anthropomorphic figures acting as intermediaries between suitcase layers. Typically, stability is achieved through direct stacking which the presence of figures defies, confirming instability within the stacking logic.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there exactly one human figure present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues from Image B demonstrate the addition of multiple human-like figures along with more anthropomorphic elements. This evidently provides that there is an increase in the number and type of figures compared to Image A's singular human depiction. Visual assessment of character differences, quantity, and attire confirms multiple figures.",
