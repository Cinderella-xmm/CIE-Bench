      "question": "Is the man wearing a dark navy blue suit with a white dress shirt and a striped tie?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a small figurine of a man seems to depict someone wearing a dark suit with what appears to be a dress shirt and a tie, though the small scale and stylized design of the figurine may prevent verification of exact colors or patterns. Based on world knowledge, chibi figures often stylize such details. Nonetheless, the miniature representation suggests similar formal attire as seen in the real-life Image A.",

      "question": "Does the ladder have visible wood grain and round dowel joints connecting each rung?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ladder depicted is highly stylized and simplified as part of the figurine set. It lacks detailed features like wood grain or dowel joints in such toy-like representations, as intricate details are often omitted in chibi-style artworks. The simple depiction contrasts with Image A, where the ladder does have visible wood grain.",

      "question": "Is the window divided into six panes with a cream-colored frame and visible reflections of sky and trees in the glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a miniature window that appears to resemble the original but is depicted in a simplified form without detailed pane divisions or reflections. The chibi design stylizes the window for artistic effect, lacking the realistic features like pane division and reflections seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the man depicted in a climbing posture with one foot on a lower rung and the other stepping up, hands gripping the ladder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine shows the character positioned to mimic climbing with one foot higher than the other and hands positioned on the ladder. This representation aligns with the climbing posture of Image A's individual, captured in figurine form.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a simplified diorama where the ladder appears positioned in a similar climbing pattern from lower left to upper right towards a window-like space, mimicking the composition direction found in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's window is a stylized element in a figurine set, with no real glass or reflective properties depicted. Such details wouldn't typically be present in chibi-style expressions which focus on simplified and stylized design elements, unlike the realistic reflections seen in Image A.",
