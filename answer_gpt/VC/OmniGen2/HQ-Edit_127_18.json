    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the elephant's tusks present and curved outward in a natural arc, extending from the mouth and tapering toward the tips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant figure within the suitcase has tusks that curve outward in an arc, consistent with the typical appearance of elephant tusks in nature. The visual cues show a tapering toward the tips, confirming their presence and shape.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the elephant's skin display deep, wrinkled folds across the forehead, neck, and body, consistent with natural elephant dermatology?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a toy elephant with skin that mimics the deep and wrinkled folds seen in real elephants, especially around the forehead, neck, and body. This replication is intentional in the toy design to simulate the texture of natural elephant skin.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the acacia tree present with a broad, flat canopy and extended horizontal branches above the elephant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The acacia tree inside the suitcase in Image B has a broad, flat canopy and horizontally extended branches typical of real acacia trees. This miniature version replicates the natural structure commonly seen in savannas.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the foreground covered in tall, golden-yellow grass blades that extend upward and show subtle motion from wind?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground is covered in a synthetic grass-like surface, lacking the tall, golden-yellow grass blades seen in nature. This surface doesn't show the subtle motion or texture associated with real grass.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are snow-capped mountains visible in the background, forming a distant ridge line behind the elephant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature snow-capped mountains; the setting inside the suitcase has no background elements resembling mountains, indicating a very different scene than one might expect outside.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the elephant's trunk curled at the tip and showing segmented ridges along its length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an elephant figurine with a trunk that does not appear curled at the tip, nor does it show prominent segmented ridges, as would be typical in a natural elephantâ€™s anatomy.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the elephant's ears have a large, broad, fan-shaped outline with visible internal folds and a downward flare?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's ears are broad and fan-shaped with some visible internal folds. This design choice accurately represents the natural shape and flaring seen in real elephant ears.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the lighting consistent with a source from the upper left, casting shadows on the right side of the elephant and grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lighting inside the suitcase does not exhibit shadows cast consistent with an external source from the upper left. The lighting appears evenly distributed without distinct directional shadows on the elephant or the surface it rests on.",
