      "question": "Are the individual flower petals shaped like elongated, recurved lily petals with six distinct segments per bloom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flower petals are visibly elongated and have a characteristic recurved shape typical of lilies. Each bloom appears to have six distinct segments, as is common for the structure of a lily flower. This observation is based on the visual structure and shape of the petals in the image, which appear to follow the typical lily shape and petal arrangement.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the bouquet arranged in a tightly packed, spherical cluster with multiple flowers overlapping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bouquet is arranged densely with the flowers closely packed together to form a round, spherical shape. Multiple flowers are visibly overlapping and clustered together, creating a compact and full appearance. This is a typical design for bouquet arrangements to give them a lush look.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a transparent, cylindrical glass vase holding the bouquet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows that the bouquet is held in a transparent, cylindrical glass vase. The translucency and cylindrical shape are evident from the way light passes through and the vase's shape, respectively. This can be seen from the visibility of the water and stems inside the vase.",

    {

      "question": "Is the vase positioned directly beneath the bouquet, with stems/rods extending upward from it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is indeed positioned directly beneath the bouquet, with flower stems extending upward from it. This is a standard arrangement for floral displays where the stems are positioned to hold the flowers steady and upright within the vase.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are several flowers visible; counting suggests there are around ten to twelve visible blooms and buds. This includes both fully open flowers and some visible buds. This amount provides volume and fullness typical of a bouquet.",
