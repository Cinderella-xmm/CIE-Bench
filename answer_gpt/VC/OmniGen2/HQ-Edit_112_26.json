    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the realistic cat figure retain the cream-colored body with dark brown points on the ears, face, paws, and tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat figure is positioned next to the packaging. It is crafted as a chibi-style object rather than realistic, featuring a simplified design. Its body predominantly displays shades of beige or cream, with contrasting darker points on the ears, face, paws, and tail characteristic of Siamese cats. This design simulates the color pattern from Image A, which features a realistic Siamese cat sitting on a windowsill.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the realistic cat figure have bright blue eyes with visible reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cat figure in Image B showcases large, stylized bright blue eyes with vibrant reflections, which is characteristic of the chibi aesthetic. This contrasts with the realistic cat in Image A, which has more natural blue eyes reflecting light, enhancing its lifelike appearance.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the tail of the realistic cat figure curled tightly around its body, forming a dark ring underneath?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tail of the cat figure is sculpted to encircle the base in a rounded manner, resembling the realistic cat's tail positioning in Image A, where it forms a visible ring pattern beneath the body. This shape in Image B presents a rounded foundation typical of stylized figures.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the wooden windowsill present with visible horizontal planks and warm brown tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals a wooden surface where the cat figures are displayed but not positioned on a windowsill, lacking the expansive frame surrounding the window with planks. Image A clearly depicts the realistic cat on a warm brown-toned windowsill with visible horizontal lines characteristic of window design.",
      "weight": 2,

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the small ceramic vase with blue floral pattern and pinkish-purple spherical flowers present on the windowsill?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, such a vase is absent from the scene showing the chibi cats. Image A features a small ceramic vase with floral ornamentation alongside a cluster of pastel spherical blooms that decorate a windowsill, enhancing the natural setting.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the realistic cat figure display smooth, softly shaded fur with natural gradients and texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fur of the chibi cat in Image B lacks the nuanced gradients and texture seen in the realistic cat figure in Image A, focusing on flat coloration suitable for stylized figures, rather than life-like textures or shading.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the window frame and outdoor landscape (trees, hills, overcast sky) visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not incorporate a window or background landscape, focusing instead on isolated cat figures. In contrast, Image A distinctly shows a window, beyond which lies a landscape of trees, hills, and a cloudy sky, adding to the realism and setting context.",
