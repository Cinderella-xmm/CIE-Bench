      "question": "Is the surfboard depicted with an elongated oval shape and a central stringer running along its length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on a small figurine inside a snow globe, and it lacks details typical of larger objects or real-life accuracy. The figurine sits on a miniature surfboard. It is crafted to fit within the globe rather than be precise to real-world surfboard designs. There is no visual evidence of an elongated oval shape or central stringer. Based on this, the answer regarding detailed surfboard design in Image B would be No.",

      "question": "Is there a small white wax block being held by the right hand and applied to the surface of the surfboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi figurine in the snow globe of Image B does not display any wax block activity. The focus is on the whimsical nature of the figurine, rather than explicit actions involving surfboard preparation. Hence, the visual cues do not suggest that any wax block is being used or held. Therefore, the answer is No.",

      "question": "Is the right hand positioned so that the fingers are gripping the wax block and making direct contact with the surfboard’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a figurine positioned on a surfboard but does not show the action of gripping or applying wax. The hands are not actively interacting with any objects such as a wax block, as the focus is on creating a cute scene rather than depicting real-world actions. Thus, the answer is No.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine inside the snow globe is sitting with its hands in a passive position, being part of an ornamental scene. There is no depiction of the hand being used to provide support on the surfboard. Therefore, the answer is No.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surfboard represented in Image B is part of a miniaturized artistic rendering without indications of grit or texture consistent with wax application. It is designed to be stylistically smooth to fit the aesthetic of the snow globe, not mirroring real-life textural details. Therefore, the answer is No.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine is sitting on the surfboard in a playful, upright position rather than a dynamic crouched posture typical of surfboard activity. The posture does not mimic a crouch or forward-leaning action indicating readiness to surf, as it is more relaxed and composed as an artistic element. Thus, the answer is No.",
