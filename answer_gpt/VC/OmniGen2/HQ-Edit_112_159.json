      "question": "Does the car retain the distinctive angular LED headlights and central grille intake characteristic of the McLaren 720S?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car is displayed as a model in a case, showing a different design with noticeable variations from the McLaren 720S. The headlights appear more futuristic and stylized, lacking the distinctive angular shape of the McLaren 720S LED headlights. The central grille intake in Image B's model does not match the typical shape associated with the McLaren 720S, making it apparent that the car design has been altered.",

      "question": "Is the road still a curved two-lane highway with continuous double yellow lines running down its center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the road visible through the case still shows the same structure as in Image A. It retains the curved design of a two-lane highway with double yellow lines in the center, indicating that the road's basic features have been maintained.",

      "question": "Is the left-hand hillside still present with its reddish-brown slopes and scattered autumnal vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backdrop includes a left-hand hillside with reddish-brown tones and sparse vegetation, consistent with autumn colors. This is unchanged from the natural environment seen in Image A, showing that this feature has been preserved.",

      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals a clear view of the road and its surroundings, with the right side featuring a distinct railing that separates the roadway from the ocean, serving the protective purpose of a guardrail. This configuration remains unchanged from the scene depicted in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the car positioned centrally on the right side of the road, facing forward toward the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car is enclosed in a case and placed in a scenic diorama instead of being positioned directly on the road, as seen in Image A. Its position within the case does not correlate with the original road positioning, which was center-oriented facing forward. Thus, the placement has been significantly altered.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The diorama in Image B includes a background display showing rocky outcrops in the sea, with visual elements that hint at mist or coastal spray, similar to the natural scenery visible in Image A. These features have been faithfully replicated in the artificial setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Through the windshield of the model car in Image B, the interior can be faintly seen although it is not as prominent as in Image A. However, the car model seems to have entirely different interior detailing, lacking recognizable racing seats with red and black colors. This difference indicates the added car model is quite different interior-wise from the original depiction.",
