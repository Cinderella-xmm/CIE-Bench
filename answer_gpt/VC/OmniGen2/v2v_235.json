      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the dancer is shown having short dark hair. This can be observed through the visual cues of the hairstyle, which appears closely cropped and dark in color.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the attire of the dancer is a black sleeveless leotard, identified by the distinct lack of sleeves and form-fitting appearance common to leotards used in dance. This matches the typical visual appearance of a leotard, which generally fits snugly to the body and is often worn by dancers.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) clearly shows the dancer with the right leg extended upwards while the left leg is positioned firmly on the ground, supporting the body. This can be observed by following the alignment and stretch of the dancer's legs, where the lifted right leg indicates an elevated position and the left leg has its foot placed on the floor, consistent with a support posture.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's head appears turned slightly to the viewer's left, aligning with facing forward from the dancer’s perspective. This slight turn can be inferred from the position of the head relative to the body, indicating a forward-facing orientation with a slight leftward angle.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the dancer's left hand is extended forward with the fingers spread apart (splayed). Visual observation of the image shows the hand oriented towards the front of the frame, which aligns with a gesture of extension, and the fingers are spread wide, which is typically described as being splayed.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer’s pose indeed forms a diagonal line from the lower left to the upper right of the frame. This is determined by observing the alignment of the dancer’s body, with the supporting leg starting from the lower section of the image and the raised leg and arms extending towards the upper right, creating a prominent diagonal posture.",
