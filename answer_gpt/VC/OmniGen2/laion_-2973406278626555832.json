    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the transparent tank section of the vape device clearly visible, allowing the internal liquid to be seen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cutaway diagram of a vape device, highlighting various components. The transparent tank section is clearly visible, and the liquid inside is depicted and labeled, implying visibility and measurability of the liquid level.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the black mouthpiece and cap at the top of the vape device present and correctly positioned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the diagram features a top section with a black mouthpiece labeled as 'Bactndst,' placed appropriately above the transparent tank, which indicates correct positioning.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the coil component located at the base of the device, visible through the transparent tank?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) demonstrates the coil component labeled as 'coirl' within the transparent section of the vape device but positioned towards the upper part rather than the base, allowing for visibility but not at the base.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the liquid inside the transparent tank clearly visible and present at a measurable level?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) depicts the transparent tank filled with liquid, labeled 'lnil,' clearly showing the liquid level within the tank, affirming it is visible and measurable.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the internal components (coil, liquid, battery) arranged in a logically consistent vertical alignment within the device?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays these components—coil ('coirl'), liquid ('lnil'), and battery ('battog')—in a vertical setup. However, the battery appears to be positioned above the coil, which does not follow the logical sequence dictated by typical device design, affecting vertical alignment logic.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is an airflow pathway indicated or implied in the device’s structure, such as an inlet near the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the component labeled 'Caltter bagfon' might suggest a part facilitating airflow; however, it doesn't distinctly demonstrate an airflow pathway or inlet specifically near the base of the device.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
