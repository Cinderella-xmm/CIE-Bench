      "question": "Is the dark brown tree branch on which the bird is perched clearly visible and positioned in the same location as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree branch is dark brown and visibly supporting the pink bird, but it's more stylized and illuminated compared to Image A. However, it is positioned in a similar location, supporting the bird on the left side of the frame. The different artistic style may give an impression of a different setting, but the core position aligns with Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the pink five-petaled cherry blossoms with visible yellow stamens and red centers still present in the scene, particularly near the bird and along the branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossoms are present and noticeable around the tree branch. They are depicted in a stylized form following the aesthetic of the image, but they retain the concept of having similar features like multiple petals. However, the detail of yellow stamens and red centers as in a realistic depiction are not emphasized in the stylized illustration.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the bird (or its transformed spirit form) positioned on the same branch, in the same central-left location, facing toward the left side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird, depicted in a more animated and vibrant pink spirit form, is seated on a branch in the central-left location of the frame. However, unlike Image A where the bird faced left, the bird in Image B seems to be facing right, with its head turned away from the left side of the frame.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there fresh green leaves with curled tips and visible veins growing from the branches, particularly near the bird and in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The branches in Image B do feature elements akin to leaves, but they follow the magical and vibrant color scheme of the animated setting. They lack realistic details like veins or curled tips, opting for a simplified and stylized presentation. Therefore, such leaves as initially described are not present in the same form.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sunlight originating from the upper left, casting a warm golden glow across the scene and creating soft highlights on the bird and blossoms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a sunlight source casting a natural warm glow. Instead, the background and lighting are cooler with a blue-green gradient. There is no evident golden sunlight effect as described in a natural setting, highlighting the bird and the blossoms in a way similar to Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the background contain softly blurred pink cherry blossoms and dark tree branches, forming a layered depth effect behind the main subject?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is stylized with a consistent artistic theme, where cherry blossoms and branches have a distinct presence but without the blurred effect. The illustration achieves depth and focus through contrast rather than blurring, differing from the layered depth effect created by natural blur present in Image A.",
