      "question": "Are the black-framed glasses with rectangular lenses and visible reflections on the lenses still present on the man's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is wearing glasses with visible frames and lenses, typical of black-framed glasses. However, due to the blurring, specifics about lens reflections cannot be definitively assessed. Based solely on the non-blurred indicators that resemble glasses, we conclude that the glasses are present. In comparison, Image A shows glasses, confirming their presence in both images.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the trimmed beard and mustache, particularly the defined jawline coverage and upper lip growth, still present on the man's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows no visible signs of a beard or mustache. The man's face appears clean-shaven, which contradicts the description of a defined beard and mustache. Visual cues suggest an absence of facial hair. Image A displays a visible trimmed beard and mustache, so by comparison, Image B lacks this feature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the light brown, textured, swept-back hairstyle with visible volume and side-parting still present on the man's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hairstyle appears to be dark, possibly indicating black or dark brown hair, differing from the light brown description. The side-parting and swept-back style is evident, but the color and texture differ. Comparing Image A, which presents a clear light brown hairstyle, Image B shows a hairstyle with a similar style but different color.",

      "question": "Are both hands positioned near the writing object (book), with the right hand showing a grip-like pose and the left hand partially extended toward the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both hands are near a large book on the table. The right hand has a grip-like pose while the left is partially extended, suggesting an intent to interact, consistent with the description. Image A features hands engaged with a typewriter, indicating a change of object and hand positioning in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the table surface still a flat, white, matte plane with soft reflections and no visible texture or pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a table surface that is not flat or white, with detailed patterns and textures. The surface appears ornate and decorative, contrasting with the simplicity described. Comparing with Image A, which shows a plain, white matte surface, Image B clearly differs in design.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the lighting still coming from the front-left, creating a soft highlight on the left side of the face and a subtle shadow on the right side of the neck and shoulder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears even and diffused, typical of illustrations, without distinct shadows or highlights. The effect is different compared to Image A's photograph, which has clear directional lighting causing shadows and highlights. Hence, the lighting setup in Image B differs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the man still seated with his torso slightly leaned forward, head tilted upward and to the right, eyes looking up and away?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the man sitting upright with no discernible lean forward, as the chest is aligned within the chair back. The posture appears more formal. Image A shows a forward-leaning posture with an upward head tilt. As the posture in Image B doesn't show these cues, the answer is that the posture has changed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a large book placed in front of the man, visually fitting the description of a leather-bound book, though the open pages make this clear. Comparing with Image A where a typewriter is in place, Image B features the described book clearly on the table.",
