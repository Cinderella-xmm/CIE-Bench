    "Question": "Q3: Is the brown fabric bridle with a wooden handle present on the horse’s head in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a cartoon horse wearing a simplistic bridle-like item (a cowboy hat) but lacks the brown fabric bridle and wooden handle seen in Image A's plush horse. A bridle typically involves straps fitting around the horse's head and mouth, but such features are absent in the edited image, focusing instead on cartoon elements.
