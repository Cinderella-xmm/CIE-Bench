      "question": "Are the two white armchairs with orange cushions still present in the same location as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two white armchairs with orange cushions are shown positioned facing each other by the window, which reflects an arrangement indicative of seating meant for relaxation or conversation. This arrangement appears identical to the setup seen in Image A, where the same chairs and cushions are present in the same configuration. Therefore, logically deducing from visual cues and common placement for such furniture items, the answer is yes, they are present in the same location.",

      "question": "Is the small round wooden table still present between the two armchairs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the small round table with a circular top held up by a simple leg design is situated between the two armchairs. This implies a continuity of use for placement of objects like vases or teapots, which is also seen in Image A with a similar table in same position. Comparing both images, the presence of the table between the chairs indicates it remains unchanged from its position in Image A. Therefore, the answer is yes, the table is still between the armchairs.",

      "question": "Is the large window framed by beige curtains still in the same position as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a large window centrally located in this room, framed by heavy beige curtains. This setup is indicative of a typical window dressing meant to complement room aesthetics and control lighting. Observing Image A, same architectural and decor elements are present surrounding the window, signifying no change in its position. Thus, by comparing architectural stationary features, the window remains in the same place as in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the tall indoor plant in a woven basket still located to the right of the window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a tall indoor plant set in a woven basket is seen to the right of the window in terms of viewer perspective. Such placement for indoor plants enhances room aesthetics and spatial structure typical in home decor. Matching Image A, the same plant placement is observed, indicating consistent decor arrangement across both images. Through visual deductions based on common decoration logic, the position remains unaltered, therefore the answer is yes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a beige rug is discernible on the flooring, under the furniture setup, enhancing visual comfort and floor protection typical for living spaces. Image A presents the same rug under a similar furniture assembly. Consequent comparison of both images reveals no alteration in style or location, thus establishing continuity in decor. Therefore, based on detailed observation, the answer is yes, the rug is present under the furniture.",
