    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there exactly three triangular sails attached to the dhow, arranged in a staggered vertical line?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a single triangular sail attached to the dhow. The presence of only one sail indicates that the dhow does not have three sails arranged in a staggered way. A staggered vertical line would typically imply multiple sails of varying heights, which is not present here.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dhow have a wooden hull with visible arched windows and decorative lattice railings along the upper deck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the dhow with a wooden-looking hull, visible arched windows, and intricate decorative patterns around the hull area, which resemble lattice railings. This indicates that the dhow has both the wooden hull and the described decorative elements.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the dhow oriented diagonally across the frame, with its bow pointing toward the upper right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dhow is oriented diagonally with its bow pointing towards the left side of the frame rather than the upper right. The composition and positioning do not match the described orientation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there multiple small sailboats visible on the horizon in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a graphic representation of a sea with no presence of smaller sailboats on the horizon. The image focuses mainly on the dhow and decorative elements without showing additional sailboats in the background.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B includes a sky with no visible sun or reflections over a water surface, as it is an illustrative poster styled image. Thus, there is no depiction of a sun or reflections as described.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a visible wake and reflection of the dhow beneath its hull on the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the illustrative Image B, there are no portrayals of a wake or reflection on the water surface beneath the hull of the dhow. The image primarily focuses on artistic elements and the dhow itself without showing these physical effects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the dhow have a long, pointed bow extending forward from the hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the dhow with a pointed bow that extends forward from the hull, which is typical for this type of vessel. The artistic representation maintains this characteristic feature.",
