      "question": "Does the edited image retain the metallic base of the lantern with visible engraved and perforated patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic base of the lantern can be seen, and it retains the engraved and perforated patterns at the bottom and around the midsection. This observation suggests the craftsmanship and detailed design, similar to what is often found in traditional Middle Eastern lanterns. The visual cues indicate that the metallic base is consistent with Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the stained-glass body of the lantern with clearly visible colored segments in red, green, blue, and orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lantern exhibits a stained-glass body with distinct colored segments. The visual cues show a mix of red, green, blue, and orange, similar to those in the image used to give a vibrant appearance. Comparing this with Image A, where the colors are vibrant and clear, Image B maintains this aspect of the design faithfully.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the textured honeycomb-like internal surface of the glass body that produces a warm, diffused glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lantern retains the textured honeycomb-like internal surface of the glass body. This surface helps diffuse the glow emanating from within the lantern, creating a warm ambiance. The textured pattern can be seen clearly when examining the surface details of the glass in Image B, akin to Image A.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the domed finial on top of the lantern, maintaining its tiered shape with a small loop at the very top. This structural element of the lantern is an integral part of the design and is clearly retained in Image B, aligning closely with the feature seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image show the lantern emitting a warm, internal glow from within the glass body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lantern clearly emits a warm, internal glow from within its glass body. The glow enhances the colors of the stained-glass segments and adds to the atmospheric effect. This characteristic remains unchanged from Image A, where the glow is a prominent feature of the lantern.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the edited image preserve the overall silhouette of the lantern as a bulbous glass body on a flared metal base topped with a conical finial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the overall silhouette of the lantern, comprising the bulbous glass body, flared metal base, and conical finial. The form and structure are consistent with the lantern seen in Image A, highlighting the continuity and identity of the lantern design despite any changes to the surrounding environment.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain geometric Islamic design motifs (such as stars, diamonds, or interlocking patterns) in the surrounding environment, even if scaled down or adapted into streets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surrounding environment incorporates geometric Islamic design motifs into the scene, although on a reduced scale and adapted as part of a miniature setup. Despite the change from tiled walls, Image B preserves the motif style in a different form but with recognizable elements like star and diamond patterns, similar to those in Image A.",
