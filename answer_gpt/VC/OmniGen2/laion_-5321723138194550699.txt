    "Question": "Q1: Is the number 18 present on the rear wing of the car?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the design of the race car is depicted in a stylized, cartoonish manner. The rear wing of the car shows a different design with stylized text instead of a number. Visual examination combined with the knowledge of common numbering on race cars indicates that Image B uses creative elements instead of exact replica features from real-world cars in terms of numbering.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the 'Bobcat' logo visible on the top wing of the car?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stylization and artistic elements of the cartoon illustration do not depict logos in a realistic manner akin to real-world branding but rather include abstract and fictional elements. No specific logos such as 'Bobcat' can be visually identified on the top wing.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the 'AMERICAN EXPRESS' text visible along the leading edge of the wing?",
    "explanation": "In the edited cartoonish stylization of Image B, the leading edge of the wing does not carry recognizable text such as 'AMERICAN EXPRESS.' The artistic style abstracts textual details into stylized forms, omitting specific real-world terms.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the 'ROYAL FLOORING' decal visible on the side panel of the car?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the side panel includes some fictionalized and stylized text elements typical of cartoon illustrations, but it does not specifically feature the 'ROYAL FLOORING' decal as seen in real-world scenarios. Letters and symbols may suggest branding but do not replicate actual decals.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the driver visible inside the cockpit with a helmet on?",
    "explanation": "The edited Image B in the cartoon style does not depict a driver with a helmet inside the cockpit. It follows a more simplified and graphic depiction typical of cartoons, where detailed human elements like a driver would often be omitted or minimized.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the high wing with its angular shape present above the cockpit?",
    "explanation": "The cartoon race car in Image B clearly retains a prominent feature of a high wing with an angular design above the cockpit. This feature matches the stylized representation of race car wings commonly illustrated in pop art and cartoon renditions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the car retain the low-profile sprint car silhouette with wide rear tires and narrow front tires?",
    "explanation": "Image B, despite being stylized, replicates the distinct silhouette of a sprint car with its low profile, and the exaggerated wide rear tires and narrow front tires are prominent. The design remains true to the characteristic silhouette of sprint cars, even in the artistic depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
