      "question": "Does the edited image retain the distinctive curved shape and brown-spotted texture of the bananas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no clear visual cues or any objects visible to analyze. Given the fully blank and white edited image, it doesn't visually depict the bananas or any other objects that were present in the original image (Image A). Therefore, based on common sense and the visual analysis that shows no representation of bananas, the answer is no.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) is completely blank and white, meaning it lacks visual representation of any objects, including chocolate chips. Therefore, based on the lack of visual cues, the answer must be no.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a completely blank white image without any visible objects or regions. Therefore, it doesn't visually depict butter chunks as small, pale yellow cubes or anything else related to butter. Hence, the logical conclusion is no.",
