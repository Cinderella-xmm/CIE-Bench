      "question": "Is the golden spherical knocker still present and positioned at the center of the lower half of the door?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a golden spherical element is still present but is now part of the ornate design worn by the figure, rather than being centered on a door. It is positioned centrally on the chest area of the figure, not on a door. In Image A, the knocker is centered on the actual door panels. Considering these observations, in Image B, the knocker is part of an abstract representation, not the original door. Thus, the element is no longer positioned at the center of the lower half of a door.",

      "question": "Are the intricate geometric carvings visible on both door panels, especially in the upper and lower sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a figure dressed in an intricate cloak with geometric carvings. However, these are not on door panels, but part of the figure's body garment. Image A displays the geometric carvings on actual door panels. Comparing with Image A, the carvings are abstractly represented as part of a garment design, not door panels.",

      "question": "Are the horizontal rows of black metal studs evenly spaced and aligned across both door panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features black elements resembling metal studs on the garment of the figure. However, these studs are not on door panels, as they were in Image A. The settings have changed to abstract elements on the clothing instead of metal studs on a door. Therefore, the metal studs as door elements are not present as they were.",

      "question": "Is the surrounding wall made of textured, earth-toned adobe with visible cracks and peeling plaster?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any visible surrounding wall with adobe texture and details like cracks. Instead, the focus is centered on the figure surrounded by a plain background. Image A displayed the textured adobe wall as part of the setting. Therefore, the earth-toned adobe wall with details is no longer featured.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a small square window with a blue mosaic tile pattern located to the right of the doorframe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include elements like a window or mosaic tiles, as these elements were part of Image A. The focus here is on the figure devoid of surrounding architectural features. Comparing to Image A, the architectural feature is not present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground is an indistinct tiled surface below the figure, not displaying a herringbone arrangement. Image A showed paving stones arranged in a pattern that is distinctly herringbone. Upon comparing, the ground in Image B does not exhibit this pattern.",

      "question": "Is the door framed by a carved wooden surround with geometric borders and a flat lintel above the arch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows elements resembling wooden carvings forming part of the attire of a figure but does not show the door or its surrounding frame as seen in Image A. The wooden carvings are used creatively as garment designs here, departing from the original context of being part of a door. Thus, there is no carved wooden frame around a door in Image B.",
