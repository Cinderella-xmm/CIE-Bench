    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the horseshoe-shaped grille with central mesh present on the front of the car and on the robot’s face/torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging is visible with cartoonish robots. The box art or the items do not show any clear horseshoe-shaped grille with a central mesh that would resemble a car's grille. Drawing conclusions from visual cues requires world knowledge about common grille shapes found in cars, such as Bugatti. Since Image B does not show any evident car parts replicated as the grille on robots, the answer is 'No.'",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the side panels, front bumper, and door sections red, and the roof, hood, and lower body black?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases robots within their packaging, with predominantly red coloring on their panels. A detailed observation of the rest of the car-style segments reveals no apparent color assignment similar to car parts found in red and black segments dividing them such as side panels and doors. Therefore, it does not align with the description in color layout given in the query.",

      "question": "Do both the car and robot feature five-spoke silver wheels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B's depiction, due to the character style and design, the robot emphasis does not display any evident wheels traditionally seen in cars. Offering knowledge of five-spoke wheels common in car designs, Image B’s characters do not appear to integrate them into their design. Thus, the answer is 'No.'",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the robot have gold-colored segmented armor plates on its chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows cartoon-styled red robots inside the packaging, and no visual indication of gold-colored segmented armor plates can be observed. Drawing knowledge from typical robot designs or toy elements for armor, Image B’s robot design does not replicate such detail.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the robot’s arms formed from the car’s doors and fenders, and its legs from the car’s wheels and undercarriage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction in Image B involves separate robot characters distinct from any car model; there's no integration of car parts or transformation visible in the cartoon robots placed in packaging, which implies these robots aren't modular in adapting car components into limbs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the car positioned in front of the robot, with the robot standing upright behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B centers around boxed robot figures which do not show a vehicle in front or any positioning of a robot standing behind a car. The visual cue and arrangement indicate solely robots packed and displayed, without any positioning such as mentioned in the query.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there white stripes on the front bumper and side panels of the car, and on the robot’s shoulders and face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, reviewing both the package design and characters reveals red styling across their components with no distinctive white striping evident, neither on a car nor visible on any robot's shoulders or face. Thus the observation and alignment with the query do not equate, returning 'No.'",
