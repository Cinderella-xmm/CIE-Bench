      "question": "Does the image retain the Mercedes-Benz grille and logo on the front of the van?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front grille clearly displays the Mercedes-Benz logo, which is identifiable by its three-pointed star design. This indicates that the grille and logo are indeed retained from the original design. When comparing with Image A, they share the same grille shape with the Mercedes emblem prominently displayed. The common knowledge about Mercedes-Benz vehicles supports the recognition of this logo. Therefore, both images retain the Mercedes-Benz grille and logo.",

      "question": "Is the overall shape and structure of the van consistent with the original Mercedes-Benz Sprinter design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a vehicle with a recognizable van structure, specifically resembling the classic features of a Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, such as its boxy yet aerodynamic high-roof design. Comparing Image B to Image A, both have a similar overall silhouette and structural design. While there are visual customizations, the fundamental design remains identifiable as a Sprinter van, as per common vehicle design knowledge.",

      "question": "Are the wheels placed in the same positions and maintain similar sizes as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels appear to maintain their positions relative to the van's body, similar to Image A. In both images, the wheels are aligned with the typical placement expected in a van design: one near the front and one near the rear of the vehicle. The sizes also seem proportionate to the body structure in both images, indicative of standard wheel sizing for such vehicles. This observation aligns with automobile design conventions.",

      "question": "Does the van still have clean lines and no visible side windows on the cargo area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the van maintains a streamlined appearance with clean lines, consistent with a typical cargo van design. The cargo area lacks visible side windows, which is a trait often found in vans designed for transport or delivery purposes. Comparing with Image A, both images show a similar absence of side windows in the cargo area, reinforcing the continuity of a van design focused on maximizing cargo space.",

      "question": "Does the van retain the large windshield with the same dimensions as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a large windshield that covers a substantial portion of the front, which is consistent with the dimensions observed in Image A. Both images depict a similar-sized windshield typical for vans, allowing for excellent forward visibility, a common characteristic in vehicle design. Thus, the dimensional appearance of the windshield in both images remains unchanged.",
