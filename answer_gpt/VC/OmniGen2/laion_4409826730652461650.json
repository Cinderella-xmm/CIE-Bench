      "question": "Is the tan and white fur pattern, including the white blaze on the face and chest patch, present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the cartoon horse has a tan color with a stylized white patch on its face and chest, similar to a blaze seen on real horses. Commonly, such markings are characteristic features used to distinguish toy horses. Image A shows a plush horse toy with similar tan and white fur patterns. Both images feature these colors and markings, indicating that the pattern is present in the edited image.",

      "question": "Are the dark brown mane and tail present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a cartoon horse with a stylized dark brown mane and tail, which aligns with typical depictions of horses. This matches the mane and tail seen in Image A's plush horse, allowing for a direct comparison of similar features. Thus, the dark brown mane and tail are indeed present in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the brown fabric bridle with a wooden handle present on the horse’s head in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a cartoon horse wearing a simplistic bridle-like item (a cowboy hat) but lacks the brown fabric bridle and wooden handle seen in Image A's plush horse. A bridle typically involves straps fitting around the horse's head and mouth, but such features are absent in the edited image, focusing instead on cartoon elements. Hence, the specific bridle with the wooden handle is not present.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the four dark brown wheels attached to the legs of the horse present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A shows a plush horse mounted on wheels, facilitating movement. In Image B, the cartoon horse appears in a Western setting with hooves, absent any wheel attachments. This design change means the wheels present in the original image are missing from the edited version.",

    {

      "question": "Is the light brown rocking base with the “Rockin’ Rider” branding visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A includes a rocking base branded with 'Rockin’ Rider.' In contrast, Image B depicts the horse directly on the ground in a cartoon scene, omitting any base or branding. This indicates that the base and branding are not included in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image B shows a cartoon horse with a noticeable white patch on its face and chest, resembling a blaze. Such markings are common in horse depictions as they add detail and character differentiation. Hence, the blaze is clearly visible in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoon horse in Image B has animated eyes and a smile, but these differ from the more detailed pink mouth and realistic eye colors of the plush toy in Image A. The stylized features in the cartoon do not match the specific eyes and mouth details seen in the original.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plush horse in Image A features a distinctive logo on its ear, part of branding design. Image B's cartoon representation lacks such logos or ear insignia, focusing instead on a simplified, animated aesthetic. Therefore, the logo is absent in the edited image.",
