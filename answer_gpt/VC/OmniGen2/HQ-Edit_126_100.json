    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the child still seated on the edge of the path near the water container, facing away from the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible child sitting on the edge of the path. The path is empty and there are no figures present around the house or on the path. Considering the details in Image B, the child is not present.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the curved concrete path extend from the bottom right corner of the image toward the house without deviation or interruption?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the path is visible and extends towards the house. However, the design of the path and surroundings indicate it is more natural and integrated with the environment, rather than a straight concrete path. In comparison to Image A, where the path might show concrete characteristics, Image B shows a more fictional or artistic representation.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a smaller building with a rusted corrugated metal roof visible to the left of the main house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene depicts a more idyllic and fantastical scene without any utilitarian structures. There is no smaller building or corrugated metal roof visible. The focus is on the main house designed to look like part of the tree with no additional structures.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the large green banana leaves and the cluster of bright orange flowers clearly visible in the foreground, just below the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are bright orange flowers and large green leaves present, which are likely meant to give a similar visual effect to banana leaves. The artistic style suggests these could represent natural foliage, contributing to an imaginary vibe. However, the design and style are different from Image A in terms of realism.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the satellite dish located on the right side of the upper floor, extending outward from the structure on a black metal pole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no satellite dish visible on any part of the house. The image depicts a more fantasy-oriented treehouse structure without any technical elements like a satellite dish. In comparison to Image A, which includes a satellite dish, Image B focuses on a nature-based aesthetic.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the lower ends of the stilts firmly planted in the soil along the slope beneath the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the house appears to be supported by thick tree-like structures, which give the impression that they are part of the natural environment rather than stilts planted into the ground. This natural integration is distinct from the stilt design in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the background composed of rolling green hills covered in dense forest, fading into mist under a partly cloudy blue sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a fantastical depiction of lush green landscapes with abundant trees and a clear blue sky with some clouds. The misty effect seen in Image A's background is replaced by a more vivid and stylized view in Image B, blending natural and artistic elements.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there distinct clusters of bright orange flowers growing near the base of the house, adjacent to the banana plant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are clusters of bright orange flowers present near the base of the house, integrated into the artistic theme of the environment. They contribute to the visual theme intended to mimic natural growth, similar to Image A.",
