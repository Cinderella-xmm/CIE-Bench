    "Question": "Q1: Are the two upright, pointed ears with black outer edges and pinkish-red inner patterns present on the mask?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mask features two upright, pointed ears. The outer edges are primarily black, and the inner parts have red patterns.

    "Question": "Q2: Are the human eyes clearly visible through the eye openings in the mask?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a mask that has stylized, closed white eye shapes as part of its design. These do not serve as openings for human eyes, but instead, represent the facial characteristics of a fox. The absence of human eye visibility suggests the mask is purely ornamental and not functional in showing human expressions.",
