    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image preserve the concentric spiral structure of the staircase, with steps forming progressively smaller rings as they descend toward the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the staircase clearly maintains its concentric spiral structure, evident by the visual cue of the handrail and steps forming smaller rings as they progress toward the central void. The symmetry and scaling of the steps align with the characteristic structure of helical staircases. This can be corroborated by world knowledge of architectural designs known for such formations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the parallel rectangular shadows cast across the steps by sunlight still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows rectangular shadows cast on the steps, which align parallel to the direction of the sunlight as seen through bright patches on each step. The presence of these shadows follows the usual pattern of sunlight casting sharp-edged shadows when encountering linear or angular obstructions.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a dark circular void at the center of the spiral, representing the bottom of the staircase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The center of Image B features a distinctly dark circular void, indicative of the open space typically found at the bottom of spiral staircases. The absence of any apparent obstruction in this core area highlights the architectural intention to create visual depth, a common characteristic in such stair designs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the handrail remain aligned along the outer edge of the spiral, following the same curvature as the steps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the smooth wooden handrail maintains its alignment along the outer edge of the staircase, mirroring the helical curvature of the stone steps. This is consistent with functional design principles where handrails provide support while following the stairâ€™s contour, ensuring safety and aesthetic continuity.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the stone steps still visible with their original texture, including faint veining and minor surface imperfections, even if reinterpreted as scales?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone steps display textures with faint veining and surface imperfections that are commonly seen in natural stone materials. While these might be described as scales in a different context, the texture remains consistent with what you'd expect from stone flooring, highlighting the material's innate characteristics such as light veining due to mineral composition.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the shadows fall in the same diagonal direction across the steps as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the shadows cast across the steps fall in a diagonal direction. This direction aligns with the light entering from an angle, which is consistent with how sunlight behaves when interacting with architecture, indicating the presence of light sources positioned in a similar orientation relative to the staircase.",
