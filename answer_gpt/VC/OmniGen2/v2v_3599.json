      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, we see the wall behind the objects exhibits a light blue hue. The color is a soft and pale blue, typical of wall colors in childrenâ€™s rooms or nurseries. Therefore, this matches the description of a 'light blue' wall, indicating that the wall color has remained unchanged.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crib on the right side is visible and maintains its white appearance. It features vertical bars and a curved headboard, matching the description provided. This indicates that the crib has not been altered in the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, the crib mattress is visible and displays a pattern comprising shapes in various shades, including yellow and gray. These could be described as cloud-like designs due to their soft, rounded forms. Therefore, the mattress pattern remains consistent with the description given.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the new figures (medieval knights) are positioned along the wall to the left of the crib, seemingly adopting the same relative position that was occupied by the stuffed animals in Image A. This consistency in positioning indicates that the alignment relative to the crib has been preserved.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a floor surface beneath the figures and the crib that has a beige texture, consistent with what is typically seen in carpeted surfaces. This sandy, light brown color and its texture suggest that the floor covering likely remains as a beige carpet.",
