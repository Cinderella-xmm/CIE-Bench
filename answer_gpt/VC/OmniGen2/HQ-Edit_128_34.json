      "question": "Is the McLaren logo clearly visible on the center of the car's hood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, which features a small model car within a display case, the McLaren logo is not resolvable on the hood due to the size and the angle. In such depictions, especially with model cars in showcases, brand logos may not be as discernibly detailed as on a real vehicle. Therefore, based on these factors, the logo is not clearly visible in the image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the headlights shaped in a narrow, curved, and horizontally elongated design with internal LED strips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the model car possesses distinctive headlights characterized by a narrow, curved, and horizontally elongated shape. LED strips are something you'd expect in real McLaren cars, and while the model showcases a design adapted from real car configurations, the miniaturized detail may not clearly depict internal LED strips, but the overall headlight shape aligns with the description.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the brake calipers behind the front wheels colored bright orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the model car is small, and the visible color of the brake calipers through the display case indicates that they are not vivid enough to be obviously bright orange. Models might not always reflect vivid color details of real car parts if they are not a focal part of the display.",

      "question": "Do the tree leaves display a vibrant, natural green color without significant discoloration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves on the miniature trees positioned around the model car exhibit a vibrant and consistent green color, which suggests no significant discoloration. This aligns with common expectations for such display setups, where greenery is often depicted naturally.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are white lane markings present on the asphalt road beneath the car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car is positioned within a display case, on artificial grass, and not on an asphalt road. As such, no white lane markings typical of roads are present around the model car in this setting, emphasizing that the base is grass, not asphalt.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the car have a raised, sharply angled edge along the side above the wheel arches indicating dihedral door hinges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining the model car in Image B, it displays features characteristic of a McLaren design, including what appears to be a sharply angled line along the sides above the wheel arches. This is typical of dihedral door designs. While miniature representations may only suggest these features, their presence aligns with real-world design components.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there at least two other cars visible in the background â€” one red and one yellow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which presents a miniature display, there are no visible representations of other cars in the background as the focus is solely on the model car within the display case. Given this controlled, isolated setup, it's clear that additional model cars of different colors like red and yellow are not part of this scene.",
