      "question": "Does the boot retain the same shape and arrangement of the elongated oval cutouts on the side panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boot features elongated oval cutouts on the side panels that are arranged in a similar pattern as those seen in Image A. Both images display a similar design with multiple elongated cuts parallel to each other, which are classic for adding flexibility and style to the boot. Based on visual comparison, the shape and arrangement of the cutouts appear to be identical.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the eyelets positioned in the same vertical alignment and spacing as in the original boot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyelets appear to be placed in a vertical line and have consistent spacing, similar to Image A. Both sets of eyelets are arranged to accommodate the laces in a similar standardized fashion typical of hiking boots. My reasoning suggests that the alignment and spacing between the eyelets in both images are consistent.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the outsole retain the exact tread pattern and groove depth as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tread pattern of the outsole in Image B appears to resemble the one in Image A. Both images show a rugged and textured tread designed for traction, common in hiking boots. However, the image resolution does not allow for a precise examination of groove depth, but visually they appear similar in pattern. From this examination, the tread pattern and overall design consistency are retained.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the toe cap present and shaped identically to the original, including its rounded front and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toe cap of the boot is visible and has a rounded shape and position. Comparing it to the original in Image A, the rounded contours and protective positioning that characterize a toe cap for added durability in hiking boots are preserved. The general design seems to be matched by both images.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the padded collar at the top of the boot preserved in shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a padded collar at the top of the boot in a similar shape and position as seen in Image A. This part of the boot enhances comfort and supports the ankle, a standard for high-cut boots. The design and placement remain similar between these two images, indicating that the padding is identically retained.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the boot positioned in the same side profile with the same forward tilt as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the boot in a side profile much like Image A. The angle and orientation relate closely, with the forward tilt that is typical to display shoe profiles. The consistent positioning seen in both images suggests the same side profile view is maintained.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the tongue of the boot visible and shaped similarly to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boot in Image B has a visible tongue that adheres closely to the shape shown in Image A. This element is integral for ensuring a secure fit, and the shape appears similarly proportionate and positioned in both images. Based on inspection, the tongue's presence and form are maintained.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the heel counter present and shaped identically to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The heel counter in Image B is evident as it outlines the back support and structure that resembles the design in Image A. The heel counter's function is to stabilize and support, and both images show its curved and reinforced shape that suggests similar shaping.",
