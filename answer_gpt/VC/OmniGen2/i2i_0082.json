      "question": "Is the clock frame still circular in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock is encased in a circular frame which is evident from its round shape and consistent curvature. The circular design is typical for clocks to ensure even time distribution across 12 hours. This observation aligns with common knowledge that clocks are often circular due to practicality in design. Therefore, the frame remains circular in shape.",

      "question": "Do the proportions of the clock hands and line markers remain consistent with the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the clock hands appear proportionally similar to those in Image A. The hour, minute, and second hands are distinct and maintain a proportional relationship typical for providing a clear distinction between time units. Similarly, the line markers, indicating hours, are nearly identical in length to Image A. The comparison confirms that proportions of both the hands and markers remain practically unchanged.",

      "question": "Is the clock face still white with black line markers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face exhibits a white background complemented by black line markers, similar to Image A. This contrast between white and black is common in clock designs for visibility purposes, allowing easy readability of time. The analysis reveals no change in color scheme or marker style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there still no numerals on the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the clock face displays no numerals, just black line markers to indicate hours. This minimalistic approach is consistent with Image A, matching styles often seen in modern and simplistic clock designs that focus on line markers instead of numbers.",

      "question": "Are the clock hands and markers positioned relatively the same as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the clock hands pointing to positions consistent with Image A. The hour and minute hands indicate the same time as the original, and the markers maintain their orientation around the clock face. This observation confirms that the relative positioning of all elements has remained unchanged, ensuring a consistent depiction of time.",
