      "question": "Is the large dark gray ribbon bow still present and positioned on the front-left side of the bag?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a large dark gray ribbon bow located on the front-left side of the bag, similar to what is visible in Image A. The ribbon is prominent due to its size and distinctive color, making it easy to identify its position relative to the bag. Visual confirmation from Image B and comparison to Image A confirm the ribbon's placement.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a white artificial flower that is nestled at the center of the gray ribbon bow, consistent with Image A. The flower's size, color, and position are discernable and match its original placement.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the small gray ribbon bow with a white flower is visible and remains attached to the right handle by means of a silver chain, which is identical to its positioning in Image A. The chain's presence and attachment indicate the bow's unchanged position.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edit retains the connection between the silver chain and the small gray ribbon bow as well as the right handle, reflecting the same attachment seen in Image A. The chain is a visual element that stands out against the background due to its metallic appearance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals a change in the color of the bag's body, which is now light brown rather than cream-colored. The shape is still that of a woven basket, but the visual detail and color have been edited to differ from Image A. The woven pattern is more pronounced with differences in color tone.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B no longer includes the 'JourFin LoveRibbon®' text in the bottom-right corner, contrasting with Image A where the text is clearly visible in that location. The absence of branding text in Image B makes it distinct from the original.",
