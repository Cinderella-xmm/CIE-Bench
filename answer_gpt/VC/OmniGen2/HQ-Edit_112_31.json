      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse has a distinct white blaze running from the forehead down to the muzzle, which is a common marking seen in some horse breeds.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse features a large white patch on its left side, starting from the shoulder and extending toward the flank, making it a significant and noticeable marking against its predominantly brown coat.

      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is positioned facing slightly to the right of the frame, with its body angled in such a way that the left side is visible. The horse does not face towards the left of the frame. Thus, based on the horse's orientation in Image B, the horse is not facing slightly to the left.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is composed of tall, somewhat indistinct green shapes that appear to be stylized representations of coniferous trees. These kinds of trees are typical in forested areas. Therefore, considering the background elements in Image B, the answer is affirmative.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse has a leftward cast of light which gives the left side of the mane and body a noticeable golden glow, indicating that the sunlight is coming from the left side of the frame. This visual effect is consistent with the common understanding of sunlight creating such effects when it comes from a lateral direction. Therefore, based on these observations in Image B, the answer is affirmative.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse appears to be standing within a grassy area where dandelion stalks with seed heads are growing, and these stalks extend up to the horse's legs, surrounding them. This indicates that the horse is directly standing in the field of dandelions. Thus, based on the environment in which the horse is placed in Image B, the answer is affirmative.",
