    "Question": "Q2: Are there exactly six fiery tendrils extending from the bridge to the headstock area?",
    "explanation": "Examining Image B, the guitar features dragon wings attached, but there are no fiery tendrils extending across the length of the guitar from the bridge to the headstock area. Instead, the modified design includes wings and not tendrils, suggesting the idea of an infusion of mythical elements, differing from tendrils one might expect if gauging by a similar comparison.",
