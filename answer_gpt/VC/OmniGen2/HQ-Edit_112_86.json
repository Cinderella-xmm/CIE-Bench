      "question": "Is the large central rose still present and located at the center of the teapot's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot features a prominent rose design at the center of its body. This floral motif is clear and appears prominently among other flower decorations. Based on my general knowledge of such designs and expectations for ornamental designs, the presence of a central large rose is a common decorative element intended to stand out. Comparing this with Image A, which also displays a large rose on the teapot's body, confirms its persistence in the central position. Therefore, the central rose is still present and located at the center of the teapot’s body.",

      "question": "Are the surrounding leaves and smaller flowers arranged symmetrically around the central rose in the same configuration as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of leaves and smaller flowers around the central rose follows a symmetrical pattern, aiming for visual balance. This is common in decorative designs to enhance aesthetic appeal. When compared with Image A, the configuration of these elements in Image A is also symmetrical, reinforcing that the design maintains its aesthetic balance in both versions. Therefore, the arrangement is in the same symmetrical configuration.",

      "question": "Is the spout still positioned on the left side of the teapot and shaped with a smooth, curved extension?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the spout is clearly positioned on the left side of the teapot and displays a smooth, curved extension typical of traditional teapot designs for ease of pouring. Image A shows a similar configuration, with the spout positioned leftward with a similar curved design. Thus, the spout remains unchanged in position and shape.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handle appears on the right side of the teapot and retains an arch-like shape. This design is ergonomic, suited for proper grip and balance. Comparing it with Image A, the handle has a consistent position and form, ensuring functionality remains intact. Therefore, the handle’s position and shape are unchanged.",

      "question": "Is the finial still present on top of the lid and retains its decorative knob-like shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The finial, traditionally a decorative element atop a teapot lid, is evident in Image B: it is still present and intricate, maintaining a knob-like shape. Similar to Image A, this element’s presence and form are indicative of a consistent aesthetic and functional design. Therefore, the finial retains its position and decorative shape.",

      "question": "Is the lid still covering the top of the teapot and retaining its domed shape with the decorative band near the rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a lid covers the top of the teapot, exhibiting a domed shape with an ornamental band near the rim, providing aesthetic value and closure. This matches the design seen in Image A, which confirms consistency in shape and detail of the lid across both images. Hence, the lid retains its shape and placement.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the teapot with a rounded, bulbous body shape, allowing for optimal volume holding and elegant form, characterized by a smooth transition between the base and the upper section. In Image A, this body shape is consistent, indicating the preservation of the overall design to enhance both utility and aesthetics. Consequently, the teapot maintains its body shape.",
