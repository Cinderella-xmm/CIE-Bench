      "question": "Does the robot still have two distinct upward-pointing antennae on its head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot is encased in a glass dome as a model. Upon examining the robot's head, it is apparent that it has two distinct upward-pointing antennae visible, similar to typical robot designs featuring antennas. This observation is based on the clear visual representation of these elements on the head of the robot model.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a blue-tinted visor visible on the robot’s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When analyzing Image B, the face of the robot does show an element that resembles a visor, which is tinted blue. This is a common feature in robot design, providing a futuristic appearance. The blue-tinted visor is discernible on the face when closely examining the facial components.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there red glowing elements present on the robot’s chest and eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A thorough inspection of Image B reveals that the robot has yellow glowing elements on its chest and face rather than red. This observation indicates a change from the usual red, offering different visual accents possibly for varied character representation.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the segmented armor plates with visible panel lines and rivets still present on the robot’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot model retains its segmented armor plates, and these designs often include panel lines and rivets to showcase mechanical intricacy and ruggedness. The presence of these details on the armor contributes to the realistic depiction of such models.",

      "question": "Is the distant city skyline with tall towers and construction cranes visible in the miniature landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the miniature landscape does not display a distant city skyline with tall towers or construction cranes. Instead, it features a simpler physical environment without such urban elements, indicating a focus on rural or less developed scenery.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there small green trees present in the foreground and midground of the miniature landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature landscape within the glass dome includes small green trees situated around the model. These trees add to the realism and depth in the diorama, simulating a natural environment complementing the robot model.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a visible dust cloud beneath the robot’s right foot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the robot model within a controlled environment, a glass dome, without elements like a natural dust cloud, which is typically visible in real-life settings. Therefore, a dust cloud is absent beneath the robot's foot, suggesting a static model display rather than a real operational setting.",
