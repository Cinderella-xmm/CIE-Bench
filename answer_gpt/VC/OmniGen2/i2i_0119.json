      "question": "Is the keychain version of the character still predominantly yellow in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character sits on a desk displaying a yellow hue that is characteristic of its design. The use of shading and highlights emphasizes this dominant yellow color, reflecting the character's original appearance. Since the character is mostly yellow, it maintains this color palette. Thus, based on visual observation coupled with common knowledge of the character design, it is clear the keychain version remains predominantly yellow.",

      "question": "Does the keychain version retain the large, flat duck-like bill?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character has a notable large, flat bill feature resembling that of a duck, which is integral to the character's identity and recognizable appearance. Common knowledge indicates that the character's bill is a key distinguishing characteristic. By visual inspection, the bill clearly retains its flat and wide appearance, ensuring consistency with the original character design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the keychain version retain the wide-eyed expression and puzzled look?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character exhibits wide eyes and a seemingly puzzled or confused expression. This is congruent with the character's signature look, which is often recognized by its wide-eyed gaze conveying confusion. Observing these features in Image B confirms that the keychain version has kept this expression.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the small triangular ears still visible on the keychain version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon close inspection, the character does not exhibit small triangular ears, as its design inherently lacks these features. The character's appearance is distinguishable by other attributes like the large bill and wide eyes but not triangular ears. Therefore, visual evidence and an understanding of the typical character design indicate that small triangular ears are not present in the keychain version.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Does the keychain version maintain the overall rounded shape of the creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character with a distinctly rounded body and head, consistent with its original design, which emphasizes spherical and rounded forms. This shapes a cohesive and endearing appearance. Therefore, the maintained rounded shape can be identified visually and is characteristic of the creature's typical design, which includes roundness.",
