      "question": "Does the edited subject (anthropomorphic bull) maintain the rightward walking posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the anthropomorphic bull is depicted as walking straight towards the observer, with its body facing directly forward in a centered pose, not showcasing a rightward walking posture. This is evident from the alignment of the bull's limbs and the front-focused nature of the image. Common sense indicates a rightward posture would involve a noticeable angle or twist in the body's alignment.",

      "question": "Is the saddle and seating arrangement for the riders preserved intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction is of an anthropomorphic bull in armor, which does not include riders, a saddle, or any seating arrangement. The entire concept of riders and saddles from Image A is missing in Image B. Therefore, the seating arrangement from the original is not preserved intact in the edited image.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the riders still positioned directly atop the anthropomorphic bull, maintaining their original relative height from the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not have any riders visible on the anthropomorphic bull. The focus of the image is solely on the armored bull itself, with no depiction of humans or seating arrangements. Therefore, the riders from Image A are not maintained in Image B, and their relative position concerning the ground is not preserved.",

      "question": "Does the dirt path retain its uneven and natural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dirt path appears to have a more polished and stylized texture, fitting the fantasy theme of the scene. Unlike an actual uneven natural texture, which would show irregularities and a more organic appearance, this path appears smooth and idealized. Visual cues from Image B indicate a fantasy-inspired artistic choice rather than a naturalistic portrayal.",

      "question": "Is there natural foliage visible framing the sides of the path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has foliage visible on both sides of the path, framing it with trees and greenery. The overall setting suggests a forest or wooded area, much like in Image A, where natural foliage frames the sides. The consistency of tree depiction on either side of the path shows that this aspect has been retained.",
