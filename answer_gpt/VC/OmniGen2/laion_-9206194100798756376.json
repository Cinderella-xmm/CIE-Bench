      "question": "Is the pink candle in the gold holder still present directly behind the central platter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible pink candle in a gold holder. Instead, there is a cartoon-like depiction of a chicken with a crown sitting on a plate, surrounded by other cartoon elements, such as candles but not in holders, suggesting a completely different setting. Hence, the pink candle from Image A has been replaced entirely with a different cartoon scenario.",

      "question": "Are the evergreen pine branches still forming a semi-circular frame around the central platter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a cartoon-style environment and does not feature realistic objects like evergreen pine branches. Instead, it shows cartoon characters and a comically crowned chicken on a plate. The absence of realistic elements such as branches indicates a departure from the semi-circular pine arrangement seen in Image A.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "question": "Is the red poinsettia flower with gold tinsel and star-patterned ribbon still visible at the top center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no realistic decorations like flowers or ribbons visible. The setting is a cartoon scene focusing on a king chicken and anthropomorphic vegetables. Such festive details from Image A are not present, replaced by a whimsical illustration without poinsettias or ribbons.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there exactly four place settings with white plates, yellow napkins, and silverware evenly distributed around the central platter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks the structured table setting found in Image A. The cartoon image does not depict any traditional dining elements like plates, napkins, or silverware. Instead, the focus is on a cartoon narrative that doesn't include these realistic dining setups.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon scene doesn't feature any wine glasses or similar tableware. The content is dominated by cartoon characters and a chicken with anthropomorphic elements, which suggests a more playful and imaginary setting devoid of realistic glasses or liquid reflections.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include any decorations resembling red baubles or woven balls. The cartoon theme focuses on imaginary characters and a cartoon chicken, diverting from the detailed ornamental setup present in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon-style illustration does not show any snowflake paper cutouts or similar details. The setting is entirely transformed into a fantastical cartoon narrative, which does not involve detailed paper cutouts seen in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a cartoon chicken as the central element without real lettuce leaves or cherry tomatoes. The imaginary setting replaces the real food items from Image A with cartoon renditions, which are not intended to replicate realistic decor.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B transitions the scene into a cartoon environment, which does not retain the realistic wooden tabletop texture present in Image A. The context is fully transformed with a whimsical setting, lacking real-life elements like a wooden grain texture.",
