    "Question": "Q1: Are there exactly four dragons, one in each quadrant of the cover?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cover includes decorative elements similar to dragons, positioned in the corners. However, these elements appear to be puzzle-like pieces rather than traditional dragons spread in each quadrant. Based on common sense, traditional artistic compass covers often use corner designs that resemble mythical creatures, but these could be purely decorative and not exactly dragons based on this image alone.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a central circular compass composed of concentric rings with inscribed characters?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cover features a central circular element that resembles a compass with concentric rings and engraved details that could represent inscribed characters, though they are not clearly visible as characters. Based on common knowledge of design elements, such detailed engravings often serve both decorative and functional purposes, like mimicking ancient texts.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a star-shaped pointer located at the center of the compass?",
    "explanation": "Image B clearly displays a star-shaped pointer at the center of the compass. Star-shaped pointers are traditional design features indicating direction and functionality in compass aesthetics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the dragons arranged symmetrically around the central compass, with each facing toward the center?",
    "explanation": "The decorative design in Image B features puzzle-like patterns resembling dragons. They are placed in the corners of the cover, but they do not seem to face toward the center symmetrically due to their fragmented puzzle appearance. Often, symmetrical arrangements are used for aesthetic balance, but this does not apply here.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the dragons separated by cross-shaped lines dividing the cover into four equal quadrants?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not show any cross-shaped lines dividing the cover into quadrants. Instead, the cover is a solid piece with embedded designs without distinct quadrant separation often used in intricate artistic arrangements.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there Chinese characters inscribed within the concentric rings of the central compass?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the concentric rings of the central compass have inscribed details, but it is not clear whether they are Chinese characters. Patterns often mimic inscriptions for decorative purposes, but without clarity or distinct typography, it is difficult to ascertain the language or text.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do the dragons have coiled bodies with raised heads and extended claws, consistent with traditional Chinese dragon depictions?",
    "explanation": "The puzzle-like decorative elements in Image B suggest dragon-like figures, but lack the detailed characteristics of traditional Chinese dragons like coiled bodies, raised heads, and extended claws. Artistic renditions often abstract these features for stylistic purposes.",
    "answer": "No"
