      "question": "Are the almond-shaped eyes with visible dark eyeliner and defined lashes present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the face is blurred, making it impossible to perceive specific details such as almond-shaped eyes, eyeliner, or defined lashes, which contribute to the overall appearance. Since the eyes are not discernible, visual cues of the eye shape and makeup cannot be confirmed. There is no available information to support the presence of these features in the edited image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the woman smiling with visible upper teeth in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image has a blurred face, rendering features such as a smile and visible teeth undetectable. Thus, the expression is not discernible, making it impossible to confirm the presence of a smile with visible upper teeth.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the nose with a straight bridge and rounded tip present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurred face in the edited image prevents the visibility of facial features, including the nose's shape and details like a straight bridge or rounded tip. Without clear visual cues of these characteristics, it's impossible to ascertain the presence of these nasal features.",
      "weight": 2,

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the woman have light skin with a warm undertone in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the woman is portrayed with light skin, evident around her neck and arms. The setting, lighting, and ambient colors help assess skin tone. The visible skin appears to have a warm undertone, inferred from the surrounding golden lighting and overall warm color palette of the setting.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the woman's body silhouette consistent with the original — upright, slender build, and proportional limbs — in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the edited image reveals an upright posture, consistent slender build, and proportional limb presentation. This draws parallels to the original image, where the body's general dimensions and posture are similarly exhibited. Both images show a balanced, elegant stance contributing to the silhouette's consistency.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is a silver necklace with a small pendant visible around the woman’s neck in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the woman wearing a pearl necklace, not a silver one with a small pendant. The necklace in the image is a simple strand of pearls. Thus, there is no silver necklace present.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the woman’s dark brown hair visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the woman’s hair can be seen framing her head, but its color is obscured by the image's blurred effect on the face and head. Therefore, it is not possible to verify dark brown hair based solely on the visual cues of this image.",
