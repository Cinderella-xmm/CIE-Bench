      "question": "Does the edited image retain the model’s original facial features, including dark eyes, defined cheekbones, and full lips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the face is visibly blurred, thus obscuring any specific facial features like dark eyes, cheekbones, or lips. Based on these visual cues, it is clear that details of facial features cannot be discerned. Therefore, the facial features are not retained in the edited image.",
