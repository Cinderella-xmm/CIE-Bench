        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue's right hand is raised, and the fingers are extended upward, which is commonly associated with a gesture of speaking or blessing in statues.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head of the statue features long hair that drapes around the shoulders.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows multiple inscribed plates on the pedestal under the glass dome.
