        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe that the ears are vertically oriented, standing upright, and are positioned symmetrically on the top of the head.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dark-framed glasses are clearly positioned over the area where the eyes would naturally be, indicating that the glasses are aligned with standard wearing of eyeglasses, serving a visual purpose possibly thematic or stylistic.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fur texture is visible around the shoulders and neck area, especially where it merges with the attire which includes fur-lined details. However, the head itself is not displaying white fur texture, suggesting it may be part of the costume rather than natural.",
