      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the positioning of the bird in Image B, we observe that the bird is facing directly toward us, displaying both wings widely. In a side-facing profile, usually only one side of the bird would be visible, and the head would be turned to face left or right. Based on this visual cue and our understanding of profiles, the bird in Image B does not match the criteria for side-facing, facing left.",

      "question": "Are the bird’s feet visibly gripping the branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feet of the bird are distinctly seen gripping the branch. We note the claws are oriented such that they encircle the twig, demonstrating a firm grasp, which is a typical posture for birds perched on branches. This observation, combined with the common characteristics of birds perched, leads us to conclude that the bird’s feet are visibly gripping the branch.",

      "question": "Does the main branch extend diagonally from the lower-left to the upper-right of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the main branch extending in a direction that is more horizontal rather than diagonal from the lower left to the upper right. The placement and the layout of the branch do not fit the description of extending diagonally through the frame. Considering these visual observations and the typical orientations in images, we determine the branch does not extend diagonally from the lower-left to the upper-right.",

      "question": "Are there multiple clusters of blossoms distributed along the side branches of the main twig?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, we notice multiple blossoms but they are not clustered along side branches. The blossoms are consistently distributed but they appear more on the primary branch rather than any distinguished side branches. Combining visual cues with our understanding of distributions, the description does not match that of multiple clusters along side branches.",

      "question": "Are white snowflakes visible falling throughout the sky background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual depiction clearly shows white snowflakes scattered uniformly across the pale blue sky. This is a typical scene for depicting snowfall and where snowflakes are visible against the sky background. Based on this visual assessment and understanding common snowflake depiction, the observation holds true.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is consistently pale blue, and there are no visible cloud formations or any gradient transitions observed across the frame. The typical characteristics of a sky with such uniformity suggest an absence of clouds and gradients, confirming the description provided.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is prominently positioned at the center with blossoms clearly visible on both sides of the branch. This central placement aligns with our understanding of compositional balance in images, where the main subject is often centered for emphasis, and accordingly, the blossoms are distributed on both sides. The composition confirms the described positioning and distribution.",
