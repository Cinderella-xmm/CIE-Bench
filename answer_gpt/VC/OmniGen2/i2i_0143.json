      "question": "Is the \"PARKING\" label clearly visible on the parking meter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the parking meter has a semi-circular label at the top which says 'PARK ING'. Though it retains part of the label visible in Image A, the full word 'PARKING' is not clear due to the space in the middle. From common knowledge about parking meters, this label typically spells 'PARKING' clearly. Hence, in Image B, the label is not fully clear due to the break between 'PARK' and 'ING'.",

      "question": "Does the sticker on the parking meter display the text \"ComsiAcara\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sticker visible on the parking meter displays the text 'CAINISMEASA' prominently rather than 'ComsiAcara'. From a world knowledge perspective, stickers on parking meters generally contain information such as usage instructions or advertising and typically feature clearly visible text. Image A contains the text 'ComsiAcara', which is different from the text seen in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the parking meter securely attached and standing upright on a pole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parking meter is depicted as being securely attached to a pole and standing upright. The base is clearly visible, attached to the pole like traditional parking meters. This typical structure suggests stability and proper installation based on common knowledge of parking meters.",

      "question": "Does the parking meter retain its original size and structural proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parking meter's proportions seem unchanged, similar in size and shape to a standard parking meter, and consistent with the design observed in Image A. From a world knowledge perspective, parking meters generally maintain a consistent size to accommodate their functional design.",

      "question": "Is the shadow of the parking meter visible on the ground beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the parking meter in an outdoor setting with clear sunlight and casting shadows, typical under such lighting conditions. However, the pavement area beneath the meter does not distinctly show its shadow as it is positioned on a deserted road rather than an urban sidewalk in Image A. Shadows typically follow clear angles and hues, visible in the context where light can cast them on surfaces.",
