      "question": "Is the number \"1423\" clearly visible on the front of the train?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train is illustrated with a distinct blue and yellow color scheme, and while some details like headlights are indicated, the number '1423' is not clearly visible or distinguishable on the front of the train. The artistic rendition does not include detailed numbers similar to Image A. Thus, the answer is No.",

      "question": "Does the train have two circular headlights below a central white circular light on its front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the train includes design elements suggesting train features, but the illustration style is based on a simplified artistic depiction that does not clarify the arrangement of headlights with a central circular light. Without specific detailing, we cannot ascertain this exact configuration. Thus, the answer is No.",

      "question": "Are there multiple vertical rows of white-framed windows on the side of the barn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the barn is depicted through stylized color blocks and outlines without specific details like multiple vertical rows of white-framed windows. The artistic style focuses on the outline and colors, lacking such precise architectural details found in Image A. Therefore, the answer is No.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the barn front facade does not exhibit detailed features such as doors. The representation uses solid blocks of color and abstract design, omitting specific elements like doors, which can be found in Image A. Consequently, the answer is No.",

      "question": "Do the railway tracks extend forward from under the train and curve gently to the right into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows railway tracks extending forward under the train without obvious curvature to the right; the artistic representation simplifies the track layout. Without clear visual cues or indication of a curve similar to Image A, the answer is No.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a simplified artistic rendering of a warning sign, characterized by a triangular shape and abstraction, but does not detail specifics such as a '50' speed limit sign as identified in Image A. Therefore, the answer is No.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train is visually positioned directly on the railway tracks, adhering to common design logic where trains align with tracks. This setup parallels real-world scenarios where trains follow tracks. Hence, the answer is Yes.",
