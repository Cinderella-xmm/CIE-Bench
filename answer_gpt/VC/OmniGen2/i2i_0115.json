      "question": "Does the edited image retain the figure's iconic screaming posture and facial expression, including the wide-open mouth and hands on ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the figure is not in the iconic pose of Munch's 'The Scream' with hands on ears and a wide-open mouth. Instead, the individuals are standing upright and holding guns, which does not reflect the specific posture and facial expression of anxiety and fear. This change is contrary to the original iconic pose, suggesting that the posture and expression have not been retained.",

      "question": "Is the figure still wearing the blue garment and has the same pale face as in the original painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the individuals are dressed in military uniforms, which differ significantly from the blue garment worn by the figure in 'The Scream.' These uniforms are typically gray or olive green and designed for practicality in a military context, unlike the artistic and emotional blue garment from the original painting. Additionally, the faces of the individuals are obscured, preventing a comparison with the pale face characteristic of the original figure.",

      "question": "Is the figure positioned on what appears to be the edge of a bridge or platform, similar to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a military scene with soldiers and explosions in the background rather than a serene setting by the waterfront, where the figure in 'The Scream' is standing on a bridge. There is no indication of a bridge or platform in the current scene; the figures are standing on an open field surrounded by other soldiers, which clearly differentiates the setting from the original.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the figure's limbs and body still depicted using distorted, swirling lines to convey the sense of anxiety and fear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts solid figures in a realistic militaristic style, with no use of distorted or swirling lines. The original painting uses these lines to heighten emotional tension, but here, the linear and structured depiction of soldiers creates a sense of order and discipline, devoid of the chaotic and emotional portrayal seen in Munch's work.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the expressive, swirled brushstroke style characteristic of the original painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image adopts a realistic photographic style, distinct from the highly expressive and emotive brushstrokes of Munch's painting. The original artwork is known for its dramatic and swirling brushstrokes, creating a sense of movement and emotional intensity. This edited image, however, focuses on a detailed and stark portrayal typical in historical or wartime photography, lacking the expressive paintwork found in the original artwork.",
