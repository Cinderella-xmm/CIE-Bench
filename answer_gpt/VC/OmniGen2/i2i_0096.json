      "question": "Is the sofa still black with multiple cushions evenly arranged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sofa appears black, consistent with a common contemporary design choice that pairs well with various interior themes. The cushions are arranged in a structured manner, although not perfectly symmetrical, which is typical for a comfortable, aesthetic layout in interior design. Such arrangement, while seemingly casual, is a common stylistic presentation to enhance the visual appeal while maintaining comfort.",

      "question": "Does the painting above the sofa retain its swirling orange-red vortex design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the painting prominently displayed above the sofa exhibits a swirling pattern of blended orange and red hues, characteristic of an abstract art style. This observation suggests that the design of an orange-red vortex is retained, as it still portrays the swirling, dynamic aesthetic that defines such a pattern in art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the painting still hung directly above the sofa?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the painting is observed to be positioned centrally above the sofa, aligning with typical art placement that ensures symmetry and visual balance in interior design. This suggests the position is intentional to complement the furniture setup.",

      "question": "Is the wall behind the sofa a neutral light color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wall in Image B presents a pale, neutral tone which is often used in interior design to provide a subtle backdrop that does not compete with or overwhelm other decorative elements like furniture or art. This hue allows both the dark sofa and the vibrant painting to stand out more prominently.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are notable light patterns and shadows cast on the wall, characteristic of sunlight streaming through a window. This effect is common in rooms with significant natural light sources, which illuminates the room and creates a dynamic interplay of light and shadow on surfaces.",
