      "question": "Is the rosette badge with the text \"GRAND CHAMPION\" and black-and-white ribbon design still present on the chest of the third individual?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the third individual is wearing a white top with no visible rosette badge present on their chest. In comparison, Image A shows the individual clearly wearing a rosette badge with a noticeable black-and-white ribbon, which stands out against their plaid shirt. The absence of such a distinguishing feature in Image B leads to the conclusion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the wristwatch visible on the left wrist of the third individual?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the third individual has a glove and a long-sleeved costume, which covers their wrists, making it impossible to see a wristwatch. On the other hand, in Image A, the individual is wearing a short-sleeved shirt, and the wristwatch on the left wrist is clearly visible. This discrepancy signifies that the wristwatch is not visible in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a ring visible on the ring finger of the left hand of the third individual?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the third individual has their hands either clenched or covered, with costume elements such as gloves which obscure details like rings. In Image A, the individual does not have their left ring finger concealed, and there is no apparent ring visible. The absence of specific visual cues in Image B leads to this deduction.",

      "question": "Is the tattoo visible on the forearm of the third individual?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the third individual's forearms are concealed beneath their superhero costume, resulting in no visible tattoos. In contrast, Image A depicts the individual wearing a short-sleeve shirt, which exposes a tattoo on the forearm clearly. This contrasting detail highlights the lack of a visible tattoo in Image B.",

      "question": "Are yellow daffodil flowers visible in the flowerbed behind the group?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, large daffodil flowers are prominently visible, both being held by individuals and growing in the background, dominating the setting with their bright yellow color. This is consistent with Image A, where daffodil flowers are also part of the garden setting behind the group, thus consistent across both images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the same relative positioning of individuals is visible from left to right as in Image A, suggesting that the order remains unchanged. Visual placement and spatial arrangement are consistent, with the distinguishing attire highlighting their consistent positions.",

      "question": "Is the stone retaining wall visible behind the individuals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background does not include any features resembling a stone retaining wall, instead showing a green, grassy area with planted daffodils. Conversely, Image A features a prominent stone wall behind the individuals, characterized by its brick and mortar appearance, which is absent in Image B. This contrast confirms the wall's non-visibility in Image B.",
