      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pool has been reimagined to include intricate designs and the edge no longer serves as a visible boundary between the water and the landscape due to the integration of the stone relief. The transformation into art does not emphasize a simple visual boundary as seen in Image A.",
