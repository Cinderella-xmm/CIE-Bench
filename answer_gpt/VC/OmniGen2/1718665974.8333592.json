    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the subject's eyes blue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the subject's facial features, specifically the eyes, are blurred, making it impossible to determine their color. Despite lacking direct visual evidence, any deduction about the eye color cannot be conclusively determined due to this blurring.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the subject have dark wavy hair with two feather-like adornments on each side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject in the edited image has dark wavy hair, and there are clear feather-like adornments visible on each side of the head. This shows that the hair has been styled with additional elements, consistent with the description.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a glowing golden orb centered on the chest, emitting light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a large clock centered on the chest, rather than an orb. The detailed gears and clock face suggest a steampunk theme rather than an orb emitting light, which is different from what is described in the question.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the subject facing directly forward with a neutral expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject appears to be facing directly forward. Given that the facial region is blurred, the expression cannot be discerned accurately, meaning any determination of a neutral expression is not feasible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there are clearly visible mechanical wings positioned symmetrically behind the subject's shoulders, consistent with a balanced and symmetrical arrangement common in such designs.",
