      "question": "Is the bottle’s main body still a transparent rectangular glass container with softly rounded edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle's main body is observed to have a transparent glass container with softly rounded edges. This is evident from the shape of the bottle, which maintains a rectangular outline while exhibiting rounded corners typical of many glass bottles intended for appealing visual presentation. This suggests the bottle maintains its transparency and design profile.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the interior of the bottle filled with a golden-yellow translucent liquid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the interior of the bottle does not contain a golden-yellow liquid. Instead, the liquid's appearance has changed to a clear, green color. Based on visual cues, the liquid looks completely different from any typical golden whiskey product, indicative of a different substance. This can suggest a product designed for a different purpose, like an aromatic diffuser.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the black box with the familiar structure, including the arched cutout and gold text consistent with 'CADENHEAD'S' at the top and 'ESTD. 1842' at the bottom. These elements are visually similar and suggest continuity in brand presentation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are reflections and highlights on the bottle's glass surface, seen as bright spots and lines. These visual effects imply a smooth, transparent surface that reflects light in a controlled manner, indicative of polished glass.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle is situated to the left of the box, and the arched window of the box is positioned to frame the bottle perfectly. This alignment is common for product displays, allowing the bottle to be highlighted next to its packaging.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the bottle is depicted as flat and thickened. This design feature ensures that the bottle rests stably on a surface, common for containers intended to hold liquid, providing ease of placement.",
