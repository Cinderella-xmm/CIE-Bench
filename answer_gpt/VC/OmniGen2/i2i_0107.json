      "question": "Does the chibi-style keychain retain the round glasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the chibi keychain does not depict round glasses. Chibi designs often simplify or stylize certain elements, and in this case, glasses may have been omitted for simplicity or artistic choice. Image A features round glasses as part of the original character design. Comparing the two, the absence of glasses in Image B indicates a stylistic choice typical of chibi art, where certain details might be reduced or removed.",

      "question": "Does the chibi-style keychain maintain the brown hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi keychain displays dark brown hair, consistent with Image A's depiction of the character. Chibi art often maintains key features such as hair color for character identification, thus keeping the brown hair helps preserve the character's recognizable traits.",

      "question": "Are the white shirt and red-and-yellow striped tie present on the chibi-style keychain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the chibi character is dressed with a tie in red-and-yellow stripes, matching those seen in Image A, along with white visible around the neck area which resembles a shirt. These items are simplified but present, likely to maintain the character's iconic elements in chibi format.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the character wearing a blue coat, which contrasts with the black or dark cloak seen in Image A. Chibi representations often alter attire for stylization to suit the artistic form's aesthetic, indicating the blue coat may be a reimagined version of the cloak.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style keychain maintain the overall original color scheme, including skin, hair, glasses, shirt, tie, and cloak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a color scheme that matches Image A for certain features like the tie and hair. However, the dark cloak is changed to a blue coat, and round glasses are absent. These deviations suggest a modified color palette in Image B, typical when adapting designs into chibi art.",
