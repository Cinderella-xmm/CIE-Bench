      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the dog's bust is displayed in a glass case, clearly showing the black and white markings typical of a pit bull's snout and muzzle. The white markings run prominently from the snout upwards, creating a contrast with the black coat. This contrast helps to clearly define the white areas, making them easily visible and identifiable.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the statue of the dog in the display case exhibits a predominantly black coat. The white markings on its snout and chest are vibrant against the dark black background, creating a stark contrast that emphasizes the distinct black and white coloring unique to such dogs.",

      "question": "Is the dog depicted in a relaxed yet alert posture in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bust of the dog in the edited image seems alert due to its forward-facing position, erect ears, and attentive gaze, which are typical indicators of attentiveness in dogs. However, being a bust, additional body language cues associated with relaxation or alertness are absent. Despite this limitation, the attentive facial features suggest a state of alertness while the smooth posturing without tension implies relaxation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dog's ears in the edited image, presented as a realistic bust, are naturally positioned. They exhibit a slightly forward stance, often indicating alertness or curiosity in dogs. This positioning corresponds with natural canine ear positions when relaxed but aware.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the dog's eyes appear to have a reflective quality, capturing the light shining from above in the display case. The depiction of shininess or glossiness in the eyes is often used to simulate reflectiveness, which gives a lifelike and vibrant quality to the eyes, implying alertness and realism.",
