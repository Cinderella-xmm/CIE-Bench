      "question": "Are both feet positioned en pointe, with the right foot slightly ahead of the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the statue's feet show one foot slightly raised, indicating a classical poised stance typical in sculpture representation, but not en pointe. The positioning suggests grace, but does not mirror ballet en pointe precisely. Combining this visual cue with general knowledge of classical sculpture, the statue is in a balanced pose rather than a ballet stance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both arms extended laterally from the body, with palms facing inward and fingers gently curved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue shows its arms extended outward, with hands appearing relaxed and the fingers elegantly arranged. The visual cues suggest classical sculptural style where the hands are relaxed but not precisely facing inward with curved fingers akin to a ballet pose.",

      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the head turned to the left, with the chin slightly raised?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue features a head that slightly turns and its chin has a frontward and slightly raised depiction. Visual cues suggest a statuesque demeanor where the slight turn could be interpreted as a natural gaze, offering elegance similar to sculptures.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a statue with legs that maintain a straight stance and vertical alignment typical of classical statues. The spine appears straight, aligned with the body and the back shows no noticeable arching. These cues align with knowledge of traditional sculpture postures.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The statue in Image B features arms extended outward from the body and positioned at a midpoint between hip and shoulder level, indicating an elegant postural aspect without strict adherence to hip level.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the upper body slightly tilted forward while maintaining vertical alignment through the spine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue's upper body is portrayed as upright without any visible tilt. The posture maintains vertical alignment, emphasizing balanced sculptural form rather than a forward tilt.",
