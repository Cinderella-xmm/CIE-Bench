    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the presence of two parallel railway tracks extending into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any railway tracks. Instead, there is an artistic representation of a vase with symbolic patterns and a stylized background. The presence of railway tracks is not visible, and the focus is entirely on the vase, suggesting no parallel tracks are present.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the railway track visibly curved to the right as it recedes into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the railway tracks are absent, and there is a vase depicted instead. Therefore, there is no railway track that could be identified as curving to the right or in any other direction.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the UFO positioned directly above the central axis of the railway track?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any UFO or railway track. Instead, it focuses on an ornate vase with a stylized background. Thus, it can't be positioned above or related to a railway track as none are present.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a clear horizontal line separating the sky from the land in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image illustrates an artistic depiction with abstract patterns that don't distinctly separate the sky from the land with a horizontal line. Fluid waves and clouds blend with the background, challenging the idea of a definitive horizontal separation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the railway track visibly elevated above the surrounding ground level?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains no depiction of a railway track or ground level. Therefore, it cannot be assessed as being elevated above a ground level that does not exist in this artistic render.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the railway tracks converge toward a single point on the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature any railway tracks. Instead, a vase with ornate designs is the central focus. Hence, convergence on the horizon by tracks is not applicable.",
