    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the layered petal structure around the rim of each vase, with individual petal shapes clearly visible and arranged in concentric rows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging features a vase design with individual petal shapes that are clearly visible and arranged in multiple layers, providing a visually appealing structure. This is common in designs that aim to stylistically resemble natural or ornate elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there exactly two vases present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on the packaging of the vase, with a cutout featuring the vase image prominently displayed. There are two boxes shown, one of which displays the vase design on its front face, but this does not represent an actual second vase. Thus, Image B does not contain two actual vases.",
      "weight": 3,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the interior of each vase still open and bowl-shaped, allowing visibility into the cavity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image primarily shows a packaging box with an illustration of the vase on it, where the bowl-shaped interior is visible as part of the visual design on the front of the package. This design choice is typical in product packaging to provide potential buyers a visual understanding of the product inside.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does each vase have a distinct, flared pedestal base beneath the main body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image on the packaging in Image B shows the vase design with a flared pedestal base beneath the main body, which is designed this way for stability and aesthetics. This base is a common structural feature enhancing both function and style.",
      "weight": 2,

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the two vases identical in shape, size, and orientation, with only minor positional offset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict two physical vases but rather, it shows a packaging design featuring a single vase illustration. Any perceived similarity would come from the packaging design elements rather than actual vases being compared. Therefore, there are no two vases to directly compare within this image.",
