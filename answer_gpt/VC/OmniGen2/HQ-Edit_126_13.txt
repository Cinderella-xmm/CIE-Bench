    "Question": "Q1: Is the black cast-iron teapot with a curved handle and domed lid present in the same position on the left side of the table?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there's a green teapot on a wooden tray. It doesn't match the description of a black cast-iron teapot with a curved handle and domed lid. The position of this green teapot is similar to the position described, but the type and color indicate that it's different from the teapot in Image A. This difference might suggest the image has been altered significantly in its objects.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the dark ceramic tea bowl filled with dark liquid located on a wooden tray to the right of the teapot?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are green cups with tea represented in the infographic, showing categories of tea, but none are specifically on a tray next to a teapot. Hence, the dark ceramic tea bowl filled with liquid beside a teapot as described is absent from this edited image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the matte gray ceramic vase containing cherry blossom branches with pink flowers located at the upper right corner of the table?",
    "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) features cherry blossom branches with pink flowers depicted as part of an illustration, without an actual vase placed on the table. Thus, the physical vase and its arrangement as described are not present.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the two rectangular wooden trays with engraved bamboo leaf patterns present beneath the teapot and tea bowl respectively?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, although there's a wooden tray under the teapot, there isn't another rectangular tray with bamboo leaf engravings beneath the tea bowl. The infographic format and the stylized depiction mean the specific details found in Image A are absent in the altered image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are multiple soft pink cherry blossom petals visibly suspended in the air above and around the vase?",
    "explanation": "Image B has cherry blossoms illustrated but lacks a vase and the depiction of suspended petals. Instead, the petals seem to decorate the surrounding imagery rather than float above a physical object. Thus, the representation of petals above a vase doesn't apply here.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the two dark wooden chopsticks placed diagonally across the lower right portion of the table?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), chopsticks aren't present within what appears to be a stylized infographic. The items are arranged conceptually instead of functionally on a table, indicating that such specific positioning of chopsticks found in Image A isn't represented here.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the table covered with a beige fabric featuring a repeating pattern of faint circular motifs?",
    "explanation": "Image B, as an infographic, doesn't feature a real table or fabric. There's no discernible texture or surface covering reminiscent of a table setting in Image A, reaffirming the design focus and departure from material depiction.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Is the floor composed of woven tatami mats with a green border, and is a long patterned runner visible along the edge of the table?",
    "explanation": "Image B adheres to an illustrative format, showing no real environmental backdrop such as flooring made of tatami mats. The infographic style eliminates the real-world setting displayed in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
