    "Question": "Q1: Is the sunlight originating from the upper-left portion of the sky, casting diagonal rays across the mountain range?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sunlight is visually depicted as originating from the upper-left portion of the sky, evidenced by the way the light spreads across the image, casting diagonal rays that illuminate the scene. This is indicated by the intense brightness coming from that direction, consistent with natural sunlight patterns seen at sunrise or sunset. This display of rays creating gradients of light and shadow across the mountains corroborates this assertion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there visible layers of mist or haze separating the mountain ranges at different depths?",
    "explanation": "Image B clearly shows layers of mist or haze, which provide a sense of depth by visually distinguishing different mountain ranges. This atmospheric perspective provides realistic depth cues by simulating how distant objects appear hazier and less distinct due to the scattering of light.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the tallest, most prominent peak located near the center of the image, rising above surrounding spires?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are noticeable peaks, but the tallest peak is not centrally located. The dragon, perhaps imagined as part of the landscape, might give an impression of prominence, but from an objective topography analysis, the peak is not distinctly central or the most prominent compared to its surroundings.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are there green leafy plants visible in the foreground, especially on the left side of the frame?",
    "explanation": "Image B features green foliage with detailed illustrations of leafy plants, most notably on the left side of the frame. This artistic choice complements the natural landscape setting, rooting the scene in a lush, vegetative environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the sky display a gradient from warm orange-pink near the horizon to cooler blue-gray at the top?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a realistic gradient in the sky, transitioning from warm orange-pink hues near the horizon to cooler blue-gray tones higher up. This gradient is common in depictions of sunrise or sunset, creating a visually appealing contrast.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there visible rough, dark gray rock surfaces on the mountain sides, especially on the left and right edges of the frame?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while there are mountains and rocky structures, the depiction emphasizes the fantastical and artistic rendering of a dragon rather than focusing on the explicit texture of rock. The stylized nature of the image does not prioritize the rough, dark gray textures typically associated with rocky surfaces.",
    "answer": "No"
