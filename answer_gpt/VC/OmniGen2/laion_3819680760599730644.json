      "question": "Is the \"Canon\" logo present in white text on the top of the camera body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we can see the camera with a clear 'Canon' logo prominently displayed on the top of the camera body in white text. This is a common branding practice for cameras to have their logos in a contrasting color for visibility, confirming its presence.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the \"SX 60 HS\" text visible in silver lettering on the lower right side of the camera body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the camera with the 'SX 50 HS' text visible on the lower right side of the camera body, rather than 'SX 60 HS'. This difference indicates an alteration in the design compared to what might be expected.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the inscriptions \"CANON ZOOM LENS 65x IS\" and \"3.8-247.0mm 1:3.4-6.5 USM\" visible around the lens barrel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lens barrel features distorted and creative text that does not accurately represent any standard lens specifications. Given that Image B has a more artistic rendering, the standard inscriptions are not visible.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the textured grip area on the left side of the camera body clearly visible with a pebbled or dimpled surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera is shown in a stylized manner with cartoon-like features. The grip area does not show detailed textures like pebbled or dimpled surfaces, which would be typical for usability in real cameras but are absent in this artistic depiction.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the mode dial located on the top left of the camera body, near the grip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a camera styled artistically, but there is a visible knob-like shape on the top left of the camera body near the grip that closely resembles a mode dial, which supports the idea that it is meant to suggest a mode dial.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible small circular flash unit above the lens on the camera. The area appears uniform without any specific indication or component resembling a flash unit, which contrasts with typical camera design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the main body of the camera black in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The main body of the camera in Image B is depicted in black, consistent with common camera aesthetics that favor a dark color scheme for professional and consumer electronics.",
