    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the alternating pattern of light and dark squares on the chessboard preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene depicts an artistic fantasy setting with glowing figures and a magical fire, which does not include a standard chessboard. The absence of an alternating pattern of squares like those on a chessboard in the edited image informs the conclusion.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the king located in the central position of the visible row of black pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows chess pieces as part of a fantastical scene. There is no explicit row of black chess pieces with a king centrally positioned among them. Instead, pieces are part of the overall artistic arrangement.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there exactly two bishops, two knights, and at least four pawns visible in their original positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image represents a fantasy setting where chess pieces are integrated into an artistic scene and not situated in their original chessboard positions. The focus is on artistic representation rather than traditional chess setup.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the shadows of the chess pieces extend diagonally toward the bottom-left of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there are no distinct shadows of chess pieces extending in a particular direction, as the visual focuses more on the mystical elements and character design rather than the presence or direction of individual shadows.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wood grain texture of the chessboard surface visible across the light squares?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a traditional chessboard with wood grain texture; instead, it conveys a mystical scene with glowing elements. The textures and patterns of an actual chessboard are not present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a blurred background with horizontal structural lines visible behind the chessboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a fantasy forest background that is more detailed and clear, rather than blurred with structural lines. This explains the absence of horizontal structural lines as seen traditionally behind a chessboard.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there exactly eight black chess pieces visible in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B transforms chess pieces into a fantastical visual with artistic elements; it does not preserve the traditional number of black pieces that would be visible in a standard strategic position on a chessboard.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the background of the image blurred while the foreground pieces are in sharp focus?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the scene conveys a fantasy forest environment with mystical figures and glowing elements. Both the background and foreground components are depicted in artistic detail rather than using traditional photographic focus, indicating no selective blurring.",
