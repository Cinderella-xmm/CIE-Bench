      "question": "Is the classical archway with ornate carvings present and maintaining its original shape and position in the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no classical archway visible. Instead, there is a wooden shelf, suggesting a change in setting. Image A originally features a classical archway with intricate carvings. The presence of a wooden shelf in Image B confirms a significant change, implying a lack of an archway. Therefore, the ornate carvings associated with classical architecture are not present in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the Corinthian column capital with acanthus leaf detailing visible and correctly positioned beneath the spherical perch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a plush pigeon toy sitting on a shelf without any visible Corinthian column capital beneath it. Image A features a realistic pigeon positioned on a Corinthian column capital with detailed acanthus leaf carvings. The transition in Image B to a shelf setting without classical architectural elements confirms the absence of a Corinthian column capital.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the perch located directly on top of the Corinthian column capital, maintaining its original vertical alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a plush pigeon placed within a shelf setting, differing significantly from the realistic pigeon atop a Corinthian column capital in Image A. The shift in scenery and the absence of architectural elements in Image B confirms the perch isn't located on a column capital or maintaining any vertical alignment with such architectural positioning.",

      "question": "Are the tall fluted column on the left and the distant spired buildings visible in their original positions and silhouettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, objects like a plush pigeon and some small toy buildings replace the view of the architectural scene from Image A. Image A originally depicted a classical architectural scene with columns and spired buildings against a sky backdrop. Image B's setting—a shelf with toys—indicates an absence of these architectural elements and scenery.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sky depicted as bright blue with scattered white cumulus clouds, matching the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a shelf environment devoid of any sky or clouds as seen in Image A. Image A's depiction of a bright blue sky with white cumulus clouds is not present in the edited image, which focuses instead on the shelf and toy placements indoors.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is set in a shelf environment without any visible floral or scroll carvings, unlike Image A, which incorporates architectural elements such as archway and column decorations. Image B's emphasis on toy objects and absence of architectural details confirms the lack of such carvings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pigeon in Image B is a plush toy looking forward, contrasting with Image A's realistic pigeon oriented sideways with its head turned slightly towards the viewer. This difference in posture is evident due to the toy's straight-ahead orientation, confirming the change.",
