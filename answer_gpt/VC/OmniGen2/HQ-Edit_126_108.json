    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the two large dark boulders positioned in the foreground grassy area near the cliff edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no boulders visible in the foreground. Instead, Image B depicts a figure with an ethereal, glowing appearance standing over a riverbed, surrounded by crystal formations. Therefore, in Image B, the analysis shows no presence of dark boulders similar to those found in scenic landscapes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a visible dirt path curving through the grass toward the cliff edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is centered around a mystical figure and the environment includes crystals and water, lacking grassy areas or pathways. Analysis shows no evidence of any dirt path akin to those appearing in natural scenery.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are tree branches extending from the top-left corner into the frame, casting shadows over the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is largely enclosed by rocky sides and the glowing figure, without tree branches extending from the edges of the frame. The analysis shows the absence of any tree branch details as found in traditional nature scenes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sunlight illuminating the scene from the right side, casting warm golden light on the waterfall and mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a mystical glow surrounding the figure and crystals. The lighting is predominantly bright and cool, as opposed to warm sunlight typically seen in natural scenes. Hence, the analysis shows no evidence of the warm golden sunlight commonly associated with an illuminated landscape.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a wide river flowing across a flat plain above the waterfall, with scattered green islands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a small body of water at the base of the figure, but it does not resemble a wide river across a plain with islands. The analysis indicates a different setting focused on mystical elements rather than landscape features.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there dark, layered mountains visible in the background under a partly cloudy sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features rocky sides near the figure and environment but not wide-scaled dark mountains in the background typical to landscapes. The sky is mostly obscured by the mystical setting rather than clouds above mountains.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there visible mist rising from the base of the waterfall and diffusing into the air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts an ethereal setting where the focus is on a mystical figure and glowing crystal formations without traditional mist elements associated with waterfalls. The analysis shows no evidence of mist rising and diffusing into the air.",
