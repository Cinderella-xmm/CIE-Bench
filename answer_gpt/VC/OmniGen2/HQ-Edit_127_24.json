    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there exactly two chalet-style buildings visible in the scene, positioned side-by-side on a snowy slope?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show two small buildings that resemble cottages rather than traditional chalet-style buildings. These structures are in front of the large ice castle and not positioned on a snowy slope. They seem more fantasy-themed, made of ice, with distinct architectural features unlike traditional chalets. Comparing this to a typical understanding of chalet-style structures, Image B diverges significantly and includes a fantastical setting with ice formations and structures, not a realistic snowy slope scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there visible smoke rising from at least one chimney on a building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon inspection, there is a small amount of smoke visible rising from the chimney of one of the small cottage-like structures. This detail aligns with typical visual depictions of cozy, inhabited buildings, even if fantasy-themed, suggesting that a source of warmth is indicated.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there multiple windows across both buildings that emit a warm yellow-orange glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cottage structures have windows, but instead of a warm yellow-orange glow, the overall hue is much cooler, aligning with the icy aesthetic of the scene. The windows appear to emit a bluish or white glow consistent with the icy theme, distinctly different from a natural yellow-orange tone typically associated with warmth.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there tall, conical evergreen trees with snow-covered branches visible behind and around the chalets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features trees that are iconically shaped like evergreen trees, but they are stylized and constructed from ice, fitting into the fantasy landscape with the ice castle. These trees do not have natural snow-covered branches typically found on evergreen trees but are instead a creative interpretation, making them distinct.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a large, snow-capped mountain peak visible in the background, rising above the treeline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background shows no realistic snow-capped mountain peaks. Instead, the dominant feature is an elaborate ice castle and fantasy-like mountain shapes that aren't natural. The depicted scene eliminates any naturalistic snow-capped mountains as commonly understood in a realistic setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there smooth, rounded snowdrifts in the foreground, casting soft shadows toward the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a smooth, ice-covered landscape rather than traditional snowdrifts. The pathways and surfaces appear deliberately shaped and more consistent with an icy winter wonderland or fantasy theme rather than actual snowdrifts casting natural shadows.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a bright, circular light source (moon) visible in the upper-right portion of the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky features visible Aurora Borealis lights with no clear, bright circular light source resembling a moon. The lighting of the scene is characterized by the fantastical aurora rather than a distinct celestial body typically understood as the moon.",
