    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the central waterfall positioned vertically in the middle of the image, descending from the upper cliff to the river below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central waterfall is not defined by natural flowing water but by a bright neon light cascade, positioned vertically in the middle of the scene. The bright cascade gives an impression of centrality and prominence in the composition, descending towards the ground, which mimics a waterfall's motion. Thus, using these cues, the answer is centered around this neon waterfall structure.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a large, curved tree on the left side of the image with a diagonal branch extending upward and bearing clusters of small purple flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, trees are depicted as large, twisted structures, enhanced with vibrant neon lights, and do not bear clusters of small purple flowers. The environment suggests an artificial or digital aesthetic, lacking natural flower details as seen in typical trees. The tree on the left is large and curved, similar to a tree, but it is purely constructed from light without natural flower features.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the river originate in the foreground and curve toward the base of the central waterfall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a futuristic and artistic scene where natural elements like rivers are transformed into LED-like streams or designs. There is no visual indication of a river originating in the foreground when observing the neon and light-centered landscape; the bottom lacks natural transitions or curves toward the waterfall, replaced instead by platform bases supporting the neon-lit structures.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible rocks scattered along the riverbed in the foreground and midground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The digital-themed design in Image B does not contain natural elements such as rocks or riverbeds typically found in natural sceneries. The neon-focused art composition shows sleek surfaces, platforms, and plants, but no natural rocks evident along a riverbed.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there two smaller waterfalls visible on the right-hand cliff face, behind the main waterfall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the visually transformed artistic environment of Image B, waterfalls are interpreted as beams of light, creating an artificial representation. These neon waterfalls do not follow natural formations; instead, adjacent trees emit similar light flows but are not distinguishable as smaller waterfalls on right-hand cliffs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a dense canopy at the top of the image with sunlight streaming through gaps, creating bright patches on the foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a stylized lighting effect rather than sunlight streaming through a natural canopy. Artificial lighting techniques replace natural sunlight, providing illumination via glowing lights embedded within tree structures. Therefore, bright patches are created through artificial means rather than gaps in a dense canopy.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there small purple flowers growing on the left side of the twisted tree, near the base of its branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tree designs in Image B deviate from natural flora and embrace light-based artistry. While the twisted tree designs are apparent, they are adorned with neon lights distinct from any tangible flowers, including purple ones. The compelling visual focus on neon streaks excludes any traditional plant features like purple flowers.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there multiple mountain ridges receding into the background, fading into a hazy blue sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B captures an indoor and controlled aesthetic characterized by neon effects with no natural mountain ridges or blue skies depicted. Instead of real environments, the composition prioritizes geometric designs and lighting effects within a contained space.",
