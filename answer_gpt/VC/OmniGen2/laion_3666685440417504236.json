      "question": "Is the turquoise-colored, ribbed dome with a golden finial present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a prominent ribbed dome that is turquoise-colored with a golden finial located on top. This dome is a central and distinct feature of the structure, aligned with common architectural elements seen in similarly styled buildings. Therefore, based on this description, the turquoise-colored, ribbed dome with a golden finial is indeed present in the edited image.",

      "question": "Are the blue mosaic tiles with floral and geometric patterns covering the iwan’s facade present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the iwan’s facade is visible with blue mosaic tiles that exhibit intricate floral and geometric patterns. Such tiles are characteristic of many Islamic architectural styles found in Central Asian historical structures. Therefore, the presence of these patterns is confirmed in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the tall cylindrical minaret with a patterned band near the top visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a structure with two cylindrical towers resembling minarets, each with a band of a different pattern near their tops. While they are not as tall as typically traditional minarets, they still feature key stylistic elements like the band near the top which suggests a similar architectural intention. Thus, the edited image reflects this feature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are golden highlights present along the edges of the arches and dome in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, golden highlights can be observed along the edges of the architectural elements, such as the arches and dome. These highlights reflect light and accentuate the architectural details, which could mirror artistic or stylistic choices. Consequently, the presence of golden highlights in the edited image is confirmed.",

      "question": "Is the beige brick construction of the lower walls and base visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the construction appears smooth and polished rather than brick-like, suggesting a different material or finish from a typical beige brick construction seen in traditional architecture. Therefore, in the edited image, the specific characteristic of beige brick construction is not directly visible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the dome positioned centrally behind the iwan, with the minaret to the left side of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dome is centrally depicted behind the main architectural facade, which resembles an iwan. Accompanying minaret-like structures appear to be positioned symmetrically on either side of this construct. This realization matches the traditional layout where the dome is centrally aligned. Hence, the central position of the dome in relation to the iwan is visible, but the specific arrangement of a single minaret to the left is altered in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arches are distinctly pointed, characterized by their sharp apex, which is reflective of traditional Islamic architectural styles. These pointed arches appear prominently within the iwan and its adjacent niches, making them visible and integral to the edited image's design.",
