      "question": "Does the cake retain its two distinct layers of dark chocolate sponge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake displays two distinct layers of dark chocolate sponge, separated by a layer of chocolate filling or ganache, which is consistent with the typical structure of a layered chocolate cake. This is identifiable through visual cues: the separation between the two sponge layers is clearly visible, confirming their presence in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the top of the cake covered in a glossy, reflective chocolate glaze?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the cake has a shiny and smooth surface that suggests the presence of a chocolate glaze. This glossiness and reflection imply that a chocolate glaze, which often has a smooth and lustrous appearance, is indeed present on the cake's top.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there three visible streams of chocolate glaze dripping down the front face of the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed three streams of chocolate glaze visibly dripping down the front face of the cake. These streams of chocolate are noticeable due to their darker tone and glossy texture compared to the sponge, indicating movement of the glaze down the front surface.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the cake layers exhibit a dark brown, moist, and porous sponge texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake layers show a texture that is characteristic of a dark chocolate sponge: it has a dark color and a porous, moist appearance. This is evident from the visible porousness and slightly uneven surface, which are typical features of sponge cakes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Is the cake placed on a white circular plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background of the cake, where it rests, reveals a white circular plate. The shape and the color of the plate suggest a typical white serving dish used for presentation of desserts.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the cake maintain its triangular cross-sectional shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake is shown with a triangular cross-sectional shape, which is the typical geometry when a circular cake is cut into slices for serving. This triangular shape retains its form in the edited image.",
