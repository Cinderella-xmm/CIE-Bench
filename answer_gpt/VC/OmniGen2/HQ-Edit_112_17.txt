    "Question": "Q1: Does the hammer retain its claw-shaped end and dual-headed structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer has an unusual and abstract design with a dual handle and curved blue ends with no visible claw, which deviates from the traditional claw hammer structure, which typically includes a curved claw on one end for removing nails and a flat head for hitting. This interpretation is based on the absence of identifiable claw-like ends and the distinct stylistic choices in the edited image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the chisel retain its flat, rectangular blade with a beveled edge?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the focus of the image is on the hammer-like object, and no traditional chisel is visible. A chisel usually has a flat, rectangular blade with a beveled edge, characteristics that are not present in Image B. The visually dominant object also does not share the structural attributes typical of a chisel.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the file retain its long, straight, narrow shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there isn't an object that resembles a traditional file. A file typically has a straight, narrow shape used for abrasive work, which is not evident in the image, emphasizing the change to an abstract design focused on the dual-handled tool.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the tools positioned in the same relative arrangement as in the original image (e.g., hammer diagonal, chisel crossing file)?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tool present is oriented horizontally rather than diagonally, and only a singular tool-distorted in design-is present, rather than multiple tools in a specific arrangement as seen in Image A. The arrangement differs significantly.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the shavings retain their curled, ribbon-like shape and approximate distribution around the tools?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shavings appear as spiral-like objects, resembling decorative curls rather than functional wood shavings. They don't mimic the natural wood shavings seen in Image A, and their distribution is also more controlled and stylized.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there exactly five tools present in the image?",
    "explanation": "Image B only contains a single stylized hammer-like object with dual handles, as opposed to the five distinct tools present in Image A. This shows a significant reduction in the number of tools depicted.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the wrench-like tool retain its open-ended jaw and metal shaft shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a wrench-like tool is not visible, and the depicted object does not share characteristics typical of a wrench such as an open-ended jaw. The focus is on an abstract dual-handled object.",
    "answer": "No"
