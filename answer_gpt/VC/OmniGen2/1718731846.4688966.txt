    "Question": "Q1: Is the vertical facial split between black and white fur still present, dividing the face precisely down the center?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear distinction between the black and white portions of the dog's face, creating a split down the center. This characteristic is similar to what might be observed in chibi or stylized depictions of animals, where a clear division between two contrasting colors is often a stylized artistic choice. The central division of colors reflects typical characteristics and coherence in cartoon styles.",

However, while they have dark outer edges, the inner surfaces do not appear to be visibly pink but rather match the rest of the dog’s color.
