      "question": "Are the pointe shoes visible and correctly positioned on the ballerina’s feet, with ribbons wrapped around the ankles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ballerina illustrations show pointe shoes on the ballerinas’ feet. However, unlike real pointe shoes that exhibit detailed toes and securely wrapped ribbons around ankles, these illustrations offer a simplified representation. The artistic depiction emphasizes the ballet's posture rather than the shoes’ anatomical details, reflecting a more stylized artistic interpretation. Thus, the pointe shoes are not displayed in actuality, nor are ribbons detailed. Therefore, based on the artistic style and comparing this with the realistic detailing in Image A, the illustrated shoes are not 'correctly positioned’ in a technical sense.",

      "question": "Is the ballerina wearing a tutu with a layered, flared skirt extending from the waist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration displays a ballerina wearing a tutu characteristic of delicate, layered, and flared skirts expanding from the waist. This tutu style aligns with a classical ballet costume, similar to the more realistic portrayal in Image A. The depictions in both images emphasize the fullness and layered nature of the tutu, commonly appreciated in ballet costumes.",

      "question": "Does the ballerina have her hair styled in a tight bun at the back of her head with straight bangs across her forehead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ballerinas are depicted with their hair in a tight bun at the back of their heads. Notably, none of the ballerinas display straight bangs; instead, they possess a clean forehead consistent with traditional ballet styling. This style is a simplified artistic representation, maintaining classical ballet grooming standards similar to Image A but without the detail of bangs.",

      "question": "Is the ballerina standing en pointe with one leg slightly behind and bent, and the other leg supporting her weight in a balanced position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates different ballet postures. The depicted illustration arrangements vary, but none mimics a definitive classical en pointe position where one leg is distinctly bent and behind. Contrasting with Image A’s more precise ballet posture—a single stance display compilies classical requirements. Hence, Image B lacks a precise representation of the stance queried.",

      "question": "Is the ballerina standing on a wooden floor composed of horizontal planks with visible grain and warm brown tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks a specific background, focusing purely on ballerina illustrations against a solid background color. Hence, it does not present details such as horizontal wooden planks, the warm brown tone, or visible grains found in Image A. The omission emphasizes the artistic choice to concentrate solely on character illustrations without detailed environments.",

    {

      "question": "Is the ballerina’s head tilted upward and turned toward the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ballet illustrations show varied simple poses, yet none share a singular head posture consistently. The positions vary illustration-to-illustration, where the heads are often centralized or straightforward with no consistent upward tilt or rightward turning. In Image A, however, there's a clear upward tilt towards the right, displaying more realistic movement than in artistic representations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently highlights pink tutus on its illustrated ballerinas, matching the color theme within classical ballet expectations. Subtle decorative additions maintain an artistic embellishment sense, consistently reflected across the visuals—consistent also in stylization with Image A, where real detailing narrates a similar color scheme and adornment.",
