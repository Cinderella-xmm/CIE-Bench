    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the \"Wildtrak\" badge visible on the lower side fender of the vehicle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vehicle is constructed from LEGO blocks, and there is no badge or text visible on the model. LEGO vehicles typically lack brand-specific badges as they focus on the general shape and design rather than exact replicas that include detailed branding.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the tailgate fully lowered, exposing the truck bed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a LEGO truck model, where the tailgate is a single block and is in a horizontal position at the rear, indicating it is lowered. This is consistent with LEGO designs where components articulate according to simple hinge mechanics.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there two rear doors visible on the passenger side of the truck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO truck in Image B does not feature detailed components like doors. It is constructed with solid orange blocks representing the cab and sides, and does not depict individual doors.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the rear taillights have a vertical orientation with a red upper portion and clear lower section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO model in Image B shows taillights as red and white blocks, maintaining a vertical orientation. This matches typical LEGO design, where taillights are indicated by simple red and white patterns.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is a roof rack visible on top of the cab?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, being a LEGO model, does not include a roof rack element. The cab is constructed with LEGO blocks forming a solid roof without additional features on top.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there black trim running along the edge of the windows and the bed surround?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the LEGO model in Image B, black blocks are used on the window frames and edges of the truck bed. This visually represents trim, although it is simplified in LEGO form compared to detailed trims on real vehicles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the rear wheels positioned within distinct wheel arches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO truck model in Image B uses block shapes to indicate where wheel arches would be. These arches are represented by curved blocks above the wheels, consistent with typical LEGO depictions of vehicles.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
