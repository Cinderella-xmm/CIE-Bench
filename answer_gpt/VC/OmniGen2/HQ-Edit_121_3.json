    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the central flower beneath the butterfly a pink coneflower with a prominent spiky central cone and drooping pink petals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central flower beneath the butterfly is pink, but it does not have the defining characteristics of a coneflower. Instead, the flower has vibrant pink petals with no prominent spiky cone, and the entire composition appears more stylized and less detailed compared to how coneflowers typically appear. Coneflowers usually have a distinct central cone that is spiky and prominent, but here there is no such feature, leading to the conclusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the butterfly positioned directly above the central cone of the flower, with its body aligned vertically over it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is positioned directly above the central part of the flower, with its body vertically aligned. This symmetry is a clear compositional choice, and it is evident from the visual cues such as the straight alignment of the stem beneath the body of the butterfly and the upright position of the butterfly over the flower.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there tall golden grasses and additional pink coneflowers visible in the background behind the main flower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is characterized by an abstract grassy environment, but there are no specific tall golden grasses or clearly defined pink coneflowers. Instead, the background features stylized flowers and grass, none of which exhibit the clear characteristics of coneflowers or tall grasses. This lack of specific elements leads to the conclusion.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sky a pale blue with soft white clouds and a warm golden light illuminating the meadow from below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is indeed a pale blue, and there is a warm light illuminating the scene, indicating a sunlit environment. However, there are no visible soft white clouds in the sky. The composition is more focused on vibrant colors and stylization rather than realistic cloud details. The absence of clouds and a more artificial lighting effect result in the answer.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small clusters of purple wildflowers and pink spiky blooms visible among the grasses in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes some flowers, but they are not specifically purple wildflowers or pink spiky blooms. Instead, there are stylized flowers with a modern aesthetic, lacking the defined characteristics or colors typically associated with these floral types. The abstract representation doesn't match the detailed description provided.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the central cone of the flower have a spiky, bristly texture made of densely packed dark-tipped florets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central part of the flower does not exhibit a spiky or bristly texture. Unlike the distinct texture of coneflowers, which have densely packed dark-tipped florets forming a spiky central cone, this flower is more smooth and uniform, aligning with a more stylized representation lacking intricate textural details.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the petals of the central flower curve downward and have a smooth, elongated shape with a soft pink hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the petals of the central flower do curve downward and exhibit a smooth and elongated shape. The hue is a vibrant blend of pink and orange tones, which is consistent with a stylized artistic representation. Although it deviates from the naturalistic soft pink, the description still aligns with the observed features.",
