    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the scientist depicted with her right hand holding a pipette or similar instrument, angled toward the test tubes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character illustration of the scientist does not depict her holding a pipette or similar instrument in her right hand; instead, her hands are placed in the pockets of her lab coat. This contrasts with a potential depiction of action or use of scientific tools present in more naturalistic settings.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there multiple test tubes arranged in metal racks, containing teal or greenish-blue liquid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration includes depictions of lab equipment like flasks and retorts, but not explicitly test tubes arranged in metal racks with liquid visible. The lab elements are more stylized and simplified compared to detailed arrangements in a natural laboratory depiction.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a microscope visible on the right side of the workbench, with an eyepiece and stage clearly defined?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a cartoon-like depiction of lab elements without precise detail. A microscope with a defined eyepiece or stage does not appear on the right side; instead, stylized, generic lab icons fill that role.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there two digital screens in the background displaying circular, intricate, symmetrical molecular or crystalline patterns in blue-green tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features design elements intended to suggest a lab but does not include detailed digital screens with molecular or crystalline displays as described. The style is more illustrative and symbolic.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the scientist wear a white lab coat and round-framed glasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustrated character in Image B wears a white lab coat with pockets but does not have visible glasses depicted, which creates a professional but simplified laboratory appearance.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the liquids in the test tubes colored in shades of teal or greenish-blue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows stylized chemical apparatuses but lacks detail for depicting colored liquids in test tubes, especially not in distinct teal or greenish-blue shades.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the scientist positioned in front of the test tubes, with the microscope to her right and digital screens behind her?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the scientist iconically rather than interacting with realistic lab setup elements. She stands centrally, with lab icons on either side and above but lacks specific positioning relative to test tubes, microscopes, or digital screens.",
