      "question": "Does the edited image retain the black and white stripes covering the zebra's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B (the edited image) depicts a stylized or possibly digital representation of a zebra. This zebra features prominent black and white stripes over its body, which is characteristic of a zebra's appearance. The clarity of the stripes and the contrast between the black and white colors are distinctly retained. This understanding is based on the general knowledge that zebras are known for their distinctive stripes, which are a defining characteristic and are visually present in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the ears of the zebra in the edited image still upright?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's ears are visibly upright. The depiction of the zebra maintains typical zebra characteristics, including ear posture. Zebras commonly have upright ears as part of their natural anatomy, which is faithfully represented in the edited image. The upright position of the ears is clear due to the contrasting color on the interior of the ears against the green background and the continuity with typical zebra anatomy.",

      "question": "Is there a visible mane on the zebra's neck in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the zebra is depicted with a mane running along the top of its neck. This mane in the edited image is stylized yet still resembles the stripe-like appearance consistent with a real zebra's mane, maintaining its uniqueness against the body stripes. The brownish coloration at the top and its placement confirm the presence of a mane, typical in equine species and especially characteristic of zebras.",

      "question": "Does the zebra in the edited image still have a tail with a tuft of hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does illustrate the zebra with a tail; however, the emphasis seems to be more on the front features of the zebra, leading to less focus on the details of the tail. The zebraâ€™s tail in the edited image does not prominently showcase a tuft of hair, as the visual style might have simplified or abstracted this detail. While the tail is present, the tuft, a common feature at the end of a zebra's tail, is not visibly detailed in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the zebra depicted in a standing posture in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is depicted in a standing posture. This is evident by the positioning of the legs, which are balanced and bearing the weight of the zebra, a typical standing posture. The straight alignment of the legs down to the hooves and the overall body orientation suggest that the zebra is standing on level ground. This posture is indicative of a calm, static position conforming to what can be typically expected of a standing animal.",
