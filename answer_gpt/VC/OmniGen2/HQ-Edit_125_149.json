    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the river present beneath the bridge, flowing from the background toward the foreground with visible white water over mossy rocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there appears to be a flowing water feature that resembles a river underneath a large structure. The water is moving towards the foreground with visible interactions with rocks that are typically associated with rivers, such as ripples or white water formations near obstacles like rocks. However, this is not a traditional bridge but a tree-like figure. Despite the visual similarity to a scenario beneath a bridge, the context is different.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there moss-covered rocks visible in the river, especially near the center and right side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does display rocks situated within the flowing water, reminiscent of moss-covered stones commonly found in streams or rivers. These rocks are present in the foreground and center, consistent with a natural, riverine environment.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are multiple fallen logs visible along the left and right riverbanks, some partially submerged in the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no fallen logs are visible along the banks of the river-like feature. The scene has a mystical or fantasy element, represented by the structure rather than fallen logs. The banks are covered by vegetation without signs of partially submerged logs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a canopy of green leaves overhead, allowing dappled sunlight to filter down onto the bridge and river?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the forest setting indeed features a dense canopy of green leaves overhead. This greenery creates an ambiance of diffused light, typical of dappled sunlight filtering through leaves, enhancing the mystical look of the scene.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there several large, moss-covered tree trunks leaning toward the bridge from the left bank, with one prominently curving over the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, there aren't explicit tree trunks leaning towards the structure reminiscent of a bridge. Instead, the scene depicts a unified entity that resembles a wooden, tree-like figure rooted in the landscape. Therefore, the specified trunks are not present.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the image captured from a low-angle viewpoint, looking upward at the bridge from near the river level?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B captures the tree-like figure from a somewhat low-angle viewpoint, emphasizing the grand and towering presence of the structure. This aligns with the perspective often attributed to viewing a bridge from river level, further dramatizing the scene.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the bridge structure extend horizontally across the river, supported by towers on both sides, forming a continuous span?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a singular entity rooted in the forest, resembling a tree-like figure rather than a traditional bridge. It does not extend horizontally across a river with supporting towers forming a continuous span as a bridge typically would.",
