      "question": "Is the \"DATSUN\" text visibly present and centered on the front of the decanter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the decanter design mimics elements from a classic car. The visual inspection of the decanter shows no visible 'DATSUN' text centered on the front, instead, there is intricate ornamental design that doesnâ€™t replicate the 'DATSUN' text layout. My analysis process involved visually scanning the key features of the decanter and comparing them to common automotive trademarks for vintage cars.",

      "question": "Is the \"240Z\" script visible on the side of the decanter near the front wheel well?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, which features a decanter resembling car design elements, there is no visible '240Z' script near what would be considered the wheel area or analogous sections on the decanter. The decanter has a different focus, primarily on aesthetic branding rather than specific automotive detailing like the '240Z' script typically found on car exteriors.",

      "question": "Does the decanter maintain the long hood and short rear deck proportions of the original car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a decanter that is inspired by car design but does not exhibit the proportions of a long hood and short rear deck. Instead, the decanter is designed with symmetrical dimensions for aesthetic purposes, typical in luxury decanter designs. The analysis factored in common decanter designs and how they differ from car proportions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are vertical slats visible on the front of the decanter, mimicking the original grille pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The decanter in Image B features a solid front without vertical slats which would mimic a grille pattern on a car. The decanter design is smooth without elements that would resemble vertical grilles, focusing more on decorative symmetry. My conclusion involved visually assessing the surface and patterns on the decanter and comparing them to classic grille designs.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the \"DATSUN\" emblem positioned centrally on the front face of the decanter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's decanter has a circular decorative emblem in the center, but it does not feature the 'DATSUN' emblem. The emblem contains different branding elements typical for a luxurious decanter rather than automotive emblems. My reasoning included identifying branding typical for consumer decanters and compared it to car emblem placements.",
