    "Question": "Q2: Is the cat sitting upright with its head tilted upward, gazing toward the sky through the window?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is positioned in an upright sitting posture, with its head slightly angled upwards, seemingly looking through the window in the direction towards the sky.

    "Question": "Q3: Does the window consist of six rectangular panes arranged in a 2x3 grid with white frames?",
    "explanation": "The window visible in Image B is part of the scene with the cat. However, this image does not provide a clear view of the window's pane arrangement as there is only a portion of the window visible, making the specific 2x3 grid configuration hard to ascertain from the available visual cues.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is there a cream-colored sheer curtain partially drawn back on the right side of the window?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a part of the window where a curtain is present, but it is described within a card border, limiting the details about curtains. Therefore, without seeing a clear cream-colored sheer curtain drawn back, it's difficult to claim such specific characteristics based solely on Image B. Details on the right side related to curtains aren't evident.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q7: Is the cat sitting on a dark brown wooden floor with visible planks and natural wood grain?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the cat sitting within a card frame. There's no detailed depiction of the floor under the cat visible inside the frame as the background primarily focuses on the window and sky, thus making a judgment about dark brown wooden flooring challenging based solely on this visual.",
    "answer": "No"
}
