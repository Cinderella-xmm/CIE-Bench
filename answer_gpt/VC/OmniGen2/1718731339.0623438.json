    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the two prominent curved horns on top of the helmet still present and retaining their original shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, there are two prominent curved horns on the helmet that resemble those from Image A. Their shape and position appear consistent. Combining this visual evidence with common helmet designs in armor, the horns' presence and unchanged shape/position are confirmed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the faceplate still skull-shaped with clearly visible, glowing red eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the faceplate is not skull-shaped and does not have glowing red eyes. Instead, it appears as a smooth, featureless faceplate. This diverges from the detailed, skull-like design with glowing eyes commonly found in menacing armor designs in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the shoulder pauldrons are simplified, lacking spikes or red vein-like patterns. In contrast to Image A's intricate spiked armor, Image B's pauldron design is streamlined and polished.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chest armor appears smooth and rounded without clear segmentation, rivets, or mechanical joints visible. This contrasts with Image A, where the armor had visible segments and joint details.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the hands still equipped with clawed gauntlets featuring sharp, pointed fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands are covered in armor with articulated fingers but lack the sharp, clawed tips seen in Image A. The design is sleek instead of aggressively pointed, indicating a change.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armor in Image B is smooth and polished without signs of weathering or scars, unlike the rugged texture in Image A. The clean and reflective surface in Image B suggests a maintained or new condition.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the figure maintain its original silhouette and proportional relationship between head, torso, and limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A, the figure's silhouette and proportions of head, torso, and limbs appear equivalent, maintaining the basic humanoid form and balanced posture.",
