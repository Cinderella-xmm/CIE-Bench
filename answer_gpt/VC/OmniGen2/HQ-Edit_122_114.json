      "question": "Is the window located at the top center of the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the window is positioned just below the peak of the A-frame roof, in the center of the front facade of the house. This placement is typical for a small attic or top-floor window, aligned with architectural norms. Therefore, the window is located at the top center of the house facade.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chimney is prominent and clearly situated on the left side of the roof relative to the viewer's perspective. Its placement is consistent with traditional house designs, where chimneys are often positioned to one side of the roof.",

      "question": "Does the house have an A-frame roof with a pointed peak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The roof of the house in Image B is designed with an A-frame structure, characterized by its steep sides that meet at a pointed peak. This architectural style is often seen in cabins or small houses, providing efficient runoff for rain and snow.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a large circular opening in the front of the house where the nest is located?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of a traditional nest, there is a large circular arrangement of gears encircling the stork, suggesting an artistic interpretation of a nest. This forms a prominent circular feature on the house's facade.",
      "weight": 2,

      "question": "Is the stork located inside the nest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stork is positioned in the midst of the gear structure, which symbolically replaces the nest. Although the bird is not within a natural nest, it is central to the circular arrangement representing an abstract nest.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The foreground of Image B features a collection of yellow flowers along the base of the house, and a light-colored path can be seen leading to or around the house, forming a typical garden path-like appearance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, green trees are visible in the background, adding to the setting's natural ambiance. Unlike Image A, the sky appears smooth and blue rather than textured, indicating a clear day without the textural effect shown in the original.",
