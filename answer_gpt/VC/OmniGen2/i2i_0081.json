      "question": "Is the sink positioned directly below the mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sink is clearly visible directly below the mirror. This is determined by observing the alignment of the sink and the mirror in the image, where both elements share the same vertical axis, with the mirror directly above the sink. This setup is consistent with typical bathroom designs where mirrors are placed relatively close to sinks for convenience.",

      "question": "Does the image include a mirror with a black frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a mirror that is surrounded by a black frame, which creates a noticeable contrast against the vibrant neon pink lighting effect that surrounds the frame. This is determined by observing the clear distinct black outline that forms the shape of the rectangular mirror. Such color contrast helps highlight the frame.",

      "question": "Are the fixtures and cabinet predominantly black, while the sink remains white?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the fixtures such as the faucet and soap dispenser are black, and the cabinet also has a black finish. The sink, however, remains white, as observed by the color differences, where the rim of the sink distinctly contrasts with the black cabinet beneath it. This common design choice emphasizes the sink within the bathroom setup due to its contrasting color.",

    {

      "question": "Do the mirror, sink, and cabinets maintain their rectangular shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a mirror that is rectangular, as indicated by its corners and straight edges. Similarly, the sink and cabinets both present themselves with clear rectangular geometry. This shape is maintained and can be seen through the straight lines and 90-degree angles visible in both the sink and the cabinet outlines.",

      "question": "Is the black faucet positioned beside the black soap dispenser on the sink?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black faucet and black soap dispenser are located on the wall directly above the sink and in close proximity to one another. This arrangement can be confirmed by observing their physical placement in the image, demonstrating a typical layout in bathroom designs to facilitate easy access.",
