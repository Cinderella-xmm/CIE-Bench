      "question": "Is the subject’s left leg raised and held behind her back with both hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is shown standing in a yoga pose on the beach. Her left leg is not raised and held behind her back with both hands. Instead, she is balancing on her right leg while her hands are raised above her head. This posture suggests she is performing a standing yoga pose that does not involve holding the leg behind the back.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the sun located directly behind the subject’s torso, forming a halo-like glow around her silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the scene with the sun positioned directly behind the subject, which creates a backlighting effect and forms a halo-like glow around her silhouette, particularly around her upper body. This visual choice is often used to create a dramatic and aesthetically pleasing effect.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the beach surface visibly wet, showing reflections of the sun and ocean waves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beach surface does not show clear signs of being wet, as there are no distinct reflections of the sun or ocean waves visible. The sand appears dry, and the focus is predominantly on the subject and the background elements rather than detailed reflections in the sand.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two distinct rocky landforms are not visible. The focus is on the subject and various smaller images of different yoga poses surrounding the central figure. While there is some vague terrain in the background, it does not distinctly show two separate rocky formations like those described.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is depicted standing on the sand with the sole of her right foot flat against the ground. She is barefoot, as it is common in many standing yoga poses performed on the beach to connect with the earth in a natural setting.",
      "weight": 2,

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main subject and other depicted figures all have their hair styled in neat buns at the back of their heads. This hairstyle is often chosen for physical activities like yoga to keep the hair tidy and secure.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's head is oriented in a neutral position with her face not visibly tilted upwards towards the sky. Instead, her focus seems to be forward as she engages in a meditative pose shown in both the larger central figure and smaller surrounding images.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": false
    },

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no clear depictions of ocean waves breaking along the shoreline in front of the subject. The images focus more on the yoga poses and the central subject rather than detailed background elements such as ocean waves.",
