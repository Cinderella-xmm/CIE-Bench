      "question": "Is the kite depicted in the shape of a diamond?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main kite shown has a diamond shape marked by its symmetrical nature with four equal sides and a distinct tail that typically extends from one of its pointy ends. This is the standard design often observed in kites, which helps in their aerodynamic performance. Therefore, visual analysis confirms the shape is a diamond.",

      "question": "Does the kite retain its bright yellow color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central kite is visually characterized by its vibrant yellow hue, which is a typical color for kites that adds to their attractiveness as well as visibility in the sky. The bright yellow color is evident and clear upon observation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are two strings visibly attached to the kite?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the yellow kite with one string clearly seen attached to the kite itself. A separate string is visible connecting a white kite to the background. There is no visual evidence of a second string attached to the yellow kite. Based on the visuals, only one string can be confirmed.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the kite appear to be flying against a clear sky background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scene in Image B reveals the kite set against a clear blue sky which features minimal cloud coverage. The unobstructed background provides an open canvas that is typical for kite flying activities, emphasizing the kite's presence in the air. Thus, it is accurate to state the kite flies against a clear sky backdrop.",

      "question": "Is the kite accompanied by its yellow tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays the yellow kite with a tail that matches its color. This tail is visible extending down from the kite and has the same yellow shade, which aides in its stability and aesthetic. This observation aligns with the expectations of kite design, where tails are customary.",
