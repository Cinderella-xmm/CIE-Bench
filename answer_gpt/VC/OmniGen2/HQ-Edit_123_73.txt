    "Question": "Q1: Is the original grayish stone texture of the pyramid’s surface retained, including visible weathering and erosion patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pyramid has a distinct stone texture, but the appearance is much cleaner and less weathered compared to a typical ancient structure. The stone blocks appear more uniform in color, cleaner, and devoid of significant weathering or erosion patterns. This indicates an edited representation that lacks the weathered look seen in more ancient or real structures.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the top platform of the pyramid preserved as a flat, rectangular structure with defined edges?",
    "explanation": "The top platform in Image B is clearly flat and rectangular with defined edges. The structure is well-defined and consistent with a pyramid's top platform design, maintaining the rectangular shape seen in historical pyramid architectures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the central staircase remain aligned along the front face of the pyramid, extending from the top temple to the base?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central staircase is visible and aligned along the front face of the pyramid, extending from the temple at the top to the base. This aligns with traditional pyramid designs where a central staircase serves as the main access route.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there exactly nine distinct tiers visible in the pyramid’s structure, decreasing in size from bottom to top?",
    "explanation": "Upon close examination of Image B, the pyramid displays multiple tiers, but they are not clearly countable to exactly nine due to the potentially altered artistic rendering. This requires counting given both visual perception and typical pyramid tier design knowledge.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are patches of moss and small vegetation visible along the edges and steps of the pyramid?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a very minimal presence of vegetation along the pyramid compared to a realistic jungle-overgrown structure. While there are small areas with some green, it doesn't cover the edges or steps extensively as natural growth would typically be represented.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the shadow cast by the pyramid positioned to the lower right, consistent with sunlight coming from the upper left?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadowing are consistent with a light source from the upper left. The shadow extends to the lower right, which is typical when light is cast from that general direction, consistent with natural sunlight angles.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the pyramid located in the center of a dense tropical jungle, with trees surrounding it on all sides?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pyramid is indeed situated within a lush, tropical environment. Dense foliage and large trees surround it, fitting the description of a dense tropical jungle setting that envelops the pyramid on all sides, creating a vibrant green backdrop.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Is the top platform of the pyramid covered with dry soil and patches of moss, indicating natural overgrowth?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the top platform does not appear to have dry soil or extensive moss covering it. The top is more characterized by a minimal and somewhat stylized green surface, lacking the ruggedness seen in a naturally overgrown situation.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q9: Are there multiple white vehicles parked on the grassy area near the base of the pyramid?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the area surrounding the pyramid at the base is devoid of any vehicles. The environment is natural with green areas and pathways leading to the pyramid, showing no signs of human-made artifacts like parked vehicles.",
    "answer": "No"
