      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus has shifted to a graphical poster for an event named 'RIDERS & REINS EXPO 2024'. There is no direct visual depiction of a horse interacting with a trailer. Instead, the image features a stylized horse graphic as part of the event title design. This visual cue, combined with the context of a promotional poster, indicates that no real horse interacting with a trailer is shown.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) is a promotional graphic, with no photographic elements like a horse or trailer ramp.
