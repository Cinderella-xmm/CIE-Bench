    "Question": "Q4: Is the boyâ€™s head visibly larger compared to the shrunken size of the birds in the illustration?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration simplifies both the boy and the birds into a stylized form where proportions are not necessarily realistic.

    "answer": "Yes"
