    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are distinct horizontal sedimentary layers visible in the rock face of the cliff?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rock face is transformed into a figure with detailed armor design, and it does not display any natural cliff formation features such as horizontal sedimentary layers. The armor and body structure indicate a crafted design rather than natural formations. Thus, there are no visible sedimentary layers.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a bright, linear reflection of the sun visible on the water surface extending from the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the refraction of the sun on the water is seen as a bright linear reflection extending from the horizon across the water surface, similar to how sunlight naturally creates a reflection on water.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there multiple small boats visible on the water surface in the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B appears to lack visible boats on the water surface, as the focus is predominantly on the transformed cliff figure and landscape, and no distinct shapes resembling boats are present.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are shrubs and small trees growing along the upper edges and crevices of the cliff?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, shrubs and small trees are visible on the upper edges and crevices of the cliff, maintaining natural vegetation alongside the embellished figure of the cliff.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are large, irregular boulders and grassy patches present in the foreground near the cliff edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a grassy landscape integrated with the constructed figure, with the design of the figure incorporating natural elements like grassy patches and rocks, similar to large, irregular boulders.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the sun located low on the horizon, emitting a warm golden glow across the sky and water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sun remains in a low position on the horizon, contributing a warm golden glow that spreads across the sky and reflects on the water, consistent with a sunset or sunrise effect.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the cliff edge form a steep, continuous drop-off directly into the water below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has the transformed cliff figure directly placed above the water without a steep, continuous drop-off. The figurative transformation disrupts the natural cliff formation of a direct drop into the water.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
