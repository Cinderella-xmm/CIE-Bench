      "question": "Are the original colors of the bicycles preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the bicycles are consistent with standard recognizable colors: red, blue, yellow, and black. Without referring to Image A, they appear as distinct and typical colors. Upon examining Image A, the bicycles show identical color choices and patterns, confirming the colors are indeed the same as Image B. Hence, the original colors are preserved.",

      "question": "Are the original designs and structural details of the bicycles preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycles display detailed elements including frames, handlebars, wheels, and saddles that are typical of bicycle design. They appear realistic and professionally structured, indicating a high level of design detail. Analyzing Image A confirms the bicycles exhibit identical designs and structural details such as frame geometry and bicycle components, suggesting the structural details remain unchanged in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the original arrangement and relative positions of the bicycles preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Without analyzing Image A, the bicycles in Image B seem to have a specific positioning where they are aligned closely and partly overlapped, creating a semi-circle-like arrangement in terms of space occupation. Comparing this to Image A shows the same spatial arrangement among the bicycles. Therefore, the arrangement and relative positions are preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the shadows cast by the bicycles and their alignment with the window grid preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, shadows appear as correctly orientated and aligned beneath the bicycles, corresponding with the windowâ€™s grid structure. Analyzing Image A reflects the shadows are similarly aligned and positioned relating to the window. Thus, the shadows and their grid alignment are preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the warm, diffused lighting from the window preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a warm ambient lighting effect with a diffused feel streaming from the window, giving a sunny glow consistent with studio-like environments. Referring to Image A indicates a similar lighting ambiance, demonstrating that such lighting is consistent across both images.",
