    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the \"Fujitsu fi-7160\" model name and logo visibly present on the top-left portion of the scanner in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the scanner is depicted with a holographic design, which shows futuristic graphics including a different scanner model in the display rather than the actual Fujitsu fi-7160 model. Therefore, the Fujitsu fi-7160 logo and name are not visibly present. This is determined by observing the lack of any textual branding on the holographic scanner design as would typically be located on such a device.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the automatic document feeder (ADF) tray open and holding multiple documents, including a boarding pass, receipt, and payment slip, in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the automatic document feeder (ADF) tray is depicted as open, holding multiple items like a boarding pass, receipt, and payment slip. The visual arrangement of documents is indicated by the individual papers organized neatly within the tray, similar to common setup seen in scanners for sorting purposes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the five control buttons (Menu, Stop/Clear, Scan/Enter, Power, and directional navigation) arranged in the same configuration on the right side of the scanner in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scanner has been replaced with a futuristic holographic design which doesn't visibly include any control button arrangement on its right side. Instead, it has a visually different scanner model depicted, suggesting that the original button configuration is not present.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the power button illuminated in green on the right-side control panel of the scanner in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the holographic design of the scanner does not visibly include any traditional control panels or the illumination style typically found on a physical scanner based on its futuristic representation. Since no button or illumination is showing on the holographic display, the answer is deterred.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the row of bristle rollers visible beneath the scanning bed of the scanner in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the scanner replaced with a holographic design without the physical components like bristle rollers detectable beneath the scanning bed. The design focuses on futuristic visuals rather than the detailed structural elements of the original scanner.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the boarding pass, receipt, and payment slip clearly visible in the ADF tray with readable text such as \"Boarding Pass\", \"Receipt\", and \"Payment Slip\" in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ADF tray visually holds the boarding pass, receipt, and payment slip. Texts on these documents are visible, including phrases like \"Boarding Pass\", \"Receipt\", and \"Payment Slip\". This answer is determined by the clear visual representation of these documents with legible portions presented within the tray.",

      "question": "Does the scanner in the holographic display maintain the original black and light gray color scheme of the Fujitsu fi-7160?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B replaces the scanner with a holographic design that deviates from the original black and light gray color scheme. The holographic design uses vibrant colors and futuristic visuals unlike the traditional scanner design seen in Image A.",
