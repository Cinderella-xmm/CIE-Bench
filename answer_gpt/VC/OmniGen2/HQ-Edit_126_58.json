      "question": "Is the neck of the swan-shaped object still curved in an elegant S-shape, extending upward and backward from the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neck of the swan-shaped object clearly follows a graceful S-curve, characteristic of a swan's neck. This curvature is common in both artistic representations and real-life depictions of swans due to their natural pose. The neck elegantly extends upward and backward from the body, maintaining the swan's majestic stance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the pink berry-like accents visible on the evergreen sprigs surrounding the base of the swan?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the evergreen sprigs placed around the base of the swan are complemented by two large pink flower-like elements, which resemble stylized holiday decorations rather than berries. Given the visual cues, there aren't smaller berry-like accents visible.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a white snowflake-shaped ornament located near the base of the swan?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a decorative swan-like bottle surrounded by evergreen and pink flower accents, but there is no visible ornament in the shape of a snowflake near the base. The ornamental design seems to emphasize floral decoration, not snowflakes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface on which the swan-shaped bottle is resting appears to be covered in snow-like texture, resembling a snowy landscape. This visual cue is consistent with the context of a winter-themed image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a close-up of the swan-shaped bottle with a predominantly dark blue background adorned with a few glowing light spots, but there are no visible figures or strings of colorful lights as seen in a festival setting.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head of the swan-shaped object is directed toward the right side of the image. The curve of the neck culminates in the swan's head facing to the right, contributing to the object's elegance.",
