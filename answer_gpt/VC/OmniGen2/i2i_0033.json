      "question": "Does the illustration retain the man's original face shape and glasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the illustration, the man's face is obscured, mimicking the blurred effect of the original image. The glasses, however, are not specifically visible in the illustration. Given that the face shape is not distinguishable, and no glasses are drawn in, it does not retain the original characteristics of face shape and glasses.",

      "question": "Is the pattern on the tie retained in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tie in the original image has a detailed pattern that appears intricate with several geometric designs. In the illustration, the tie also shows a complex design with noticeable motifs. This suggests that the pattern is indeed retained in terms of complexity and style in the illustration.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the original image, the suit jacket has a subtle checkered pattern. In the illustration, the jacket appears to be solid in design, lacking any visible checkered pattern. Therefore, the checkered pattern from the original is not retained.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original image features a striped dress shirt beneath the suit jacket. In the illustration, the shirt underneath also appears to have a striped pattern, indicating consistency with the original image.",
