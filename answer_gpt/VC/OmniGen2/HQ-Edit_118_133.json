      "question": "Is the complex scrollwork and floral engraving pattern visible on the body, lid, and spout of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a candle with a label design featuring floral motifs at the bottom. However, there is no evidence of scrollwork or floral engravings on the body, lid, and spout, as this is an image of a candle without these elements. The complex scrollwork and floral engravings would typically be seen on ornate objects such as teapots or similar items, not candles. Thus, the pattern is not visible on the candle in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the object have a domed lid topped with a small finial at the apex?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a candle, which traditionally does not have a lid, domed or otherwise, and therefore no finial at the top, as it is an open-top object meant to burn. Candles are generally featured in glass jars without lids. Therefore, there is no domed lid with a finial on the candle in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the object supported by a three-legged pedestal base with decorative feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a candle placed in a cylindrical glass container situated on a flat wooden surface. Unlike objects with a decorative pedestal, candles typically do not have legs or decorative bases as their glass bodies provide stability. Hence, the candle in Image B does not have a three-legged pedestal base with decorative feet.",

      "question": "Is there a curved handle attached to the left side of the object, extending upward and backward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a cylindrical glass candle holder and does not have a handle. Handles are typical for teapots or pitchers allowing for carrying or pouring, which is not relevant for candle holders. Therefore, there is no curved handle attached to Image B's candle.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a long, curved spout extending from the right side of the objectâ€™s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a candle, which, unlike teapots or pitchers, does not feature a spout. This is because candles are used for lighting or fragrance rather than pouring, eliminating the need for a spout. So, there is no curved spout extending from the candle's body in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the object placed on a polished wooden surface with a clear reflection visible beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does show a candle placed on a wooden surface. However, the surface appears matte and not polished, as indicated by the lack of any visible reflection beneath the candle. Normally, a polished wooden surface would show a reflection, which is absent here, meaning the candle does not have a clear reflection on the surface.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which is a candle, there is no handle present, and thus no opportunity for any decorative metal fittings where a handle might connect. Decorative metal fittings often jazz up teapot handles to add flair, but since the candle doesn't have a handle, the fittings are absent here.",
