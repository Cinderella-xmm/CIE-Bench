    "Question": "Q1: Is the mango depicted with an oval shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mango is stylized with a simplified, rounded top and tapered bottom, indicative of an oval shape. Pixel art often simplifies forms, and this representation matches the general oval profile typical of a mango. World knowledge of mango shapes informs this conclusion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a small stem visible at the top of the mango?",
    "explanation": "Image B portrays the mango with a small protruding pixel at the top. While pixel art is minimalistic, this pixel suggests the presence of a stem due to its location and common mango characteristics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the paper towel folded into a cradle-like shape beneath the mango?",
    "explanation": "The pixel art in Image B shows the paper towel with distinct angles and lines, creating a shape that appears to cradle the mango. This simplified depiction conforms to how a paper towel might be arranged to hold an object, using minimal but strategic pixel placement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there four clearly defined flaps extending from the paper towel?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the paper towel features distinct sections with angles that imitate flaps extending outward. Based on pixel art conventions, these sections can be identified as flaps due to their prominence and visual separation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the mango positioned in the center of the table?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the mango prominently placed with visible space on either side, implying central placement on the table in relation to the visible area of the image. Pixel art perspectives often simplify spatial relationships, supporting this interpretation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the table show a horizontal wood grain pattern?",
    "explanation": "Image B reflects simplified and solid pixel colors primarily, lacking the detailed lines or striations that would indicate wood grain. Pixel art focuses on broad color areas rather than texture details.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is a wooden chair partially visible behind the table?",
    "explanation": "The pixel art includes an object behind the table resembling the back of a chair due to its vertical and horizontal pixel arrangement in colors typical of wood. This arrangement suggests the presence of a chair.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Is there a diagonal shadow cast by the mango onto the table?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not show detailed shadows or light gradients, as it relies on flat color blocks typical of pixel art. The absence of darker pixels to indicate shadow directions implies no diagonally cast shadow.",
    "answer": "No"
}
