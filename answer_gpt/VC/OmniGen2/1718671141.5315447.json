      "question": "Is there a raised platform beneath the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building resembles a fantastical clock tower with a steampunk aesthetic. It appears to be sitting directly on a flat surface, likely a paved area or the top of another structure. There does not seem to be a visibly elevated platform that the building is resting upon, considering the integration of gears and pipes. World knowledge about architectural design suggests that steampunk structures typically don't feature platforms for isolation but rather have integrated bases.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a still water surface directly in front of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a steampunk-style building rich in metallic textures and large gears, characteristic of industrial architecture. No water surface is visible directly in front of the building or indicated at all in the image. The atmospheric aesthetic aligns with a mechanical design rather than a reflective water scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the building have multiple horizontal tiers stacked vertically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The building in Image B features cylindrical structures forming the central part, along with towering elements but does not exhibit tiers stacked vertically. These elements are typically associated with industrial machinery, which differ from tiered architectural forms. World knowledge of mechanical design does not include tiered layers similar to the previous image’s architectural levels.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the building positioned centrally above the water pool on a raised platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a steampunk edifice with a focus on cylindrical design and gears. It is not positioned above a water pool nor on an isolated platform; rather, it appears as an industrial structure fixed on the ground, emphasizing machinery integration. World knowledge about steampunk architecture suggests it doesn’t involve water features beneath but focuses on machinery aesthetics.",

      "question": "Is the sky dark blue with scattered stars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is a clear blue, without evidence of any stars. The scene is more consistent with daylight or early evening where the structure, resembling an industrial tower, is under a gradient sky typical of twilight coloration. The lack of stars is apparent due to the clarity and contrast of the sky against mechanical shapes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there trees arranged symmetrically on both sides of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a steampunk building characterized by industrial elements like gears and pipes, positioned on a flat paved surface. No trees are visible or symmetrically arranged on either side of the structure, which focuses on mechanical features rather than natural elements. Common steampunk design involves urban or industrial themes lacking symmetrical tree lines.",
