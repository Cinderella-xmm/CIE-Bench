    "Question": "Q2: Is the stage floor made of polished wood with visible reflections of the piano and ambient light?",
    "explanation": "Image B represents a promotional poster where the stage floor's material and its reflective properties are not detailed, as the focus is on illustrating a concept rather than the exact materials used. In Image A, the stage floor is clearly polished wood, showing reflections of the piano and ambient light.
