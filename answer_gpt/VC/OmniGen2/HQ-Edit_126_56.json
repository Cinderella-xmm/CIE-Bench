      "question": "Is there a river running down the center of the image from the foreground to the distant mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the center of the image prominently features a reflective blue surface that strongly suggests the presence of a river running through the scene, connecting the foreground with the distant mountains. The linear, elongated nature of this surface and its positioning are typical characteristics of a river, commonly known for flowing from a higher elevation to a lower one, often visible in landscape imagery. No conclusion relies on Image A for assessment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there two large mountain peaks visible in the background, one on the left and one on the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two distinct triangular shapes rise prominently on either side of the central light source, resembling mountain peaks. The angular form and positioning of these shapes create a strong visual representation of mountains, widely recognized through common landscape interpretations. Analysis using Image A confirms the mountain-like structure as well.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a bright circular light source positioned near the center of the horizon line in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays a large, bright, circular shape positioned centrally and horizontally balanced along the horizon line. This shape is indicative of a sun, commonly used in artistic depiction to represent light sources and horizon points. Observations align with how the sun is typically illustrated in landscape artworks. Image A similarly showcases a sun in its landscape, maintaining consistency in light source representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there trees present on both sides of the river, extending along the banks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geometric patterns and color placements do not exhibit distinct tree-like formations along the riverbanks. Instead, the design employs abstract triangular figures that are not conventionally recognized as trees or their natural extended positions alongside the river's edge. Image A, however, offers a traditional visual of trees lining the riverbanks through a more detailed portrayal.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible rock formations or landmasses within the river, breaking the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are small angular shapes located within the blue reflective surfaces representing the river. These shapes appear as distinct objects that break the continuous water surface, visually resembling rocks or landmasses commonly found in rivers. Image A also contains similar visual cues, suggesting features commonly associated with river terrains.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the river reflect the trees and sky above it, maintaining a mirrored image across the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design elements use simplified geometric patterns which do not demonstrate reflective properties typical of a mirrored river surface capturing the surrounding landscape. Instead, the focus is on vibrant abstraction, lacking the mirrored depth seen in reflections. Image A, on the other hand, showcases a naturalistic reflection of trees and sky in the river.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the trees on the riverbanks colored in warm autumn tones such as red, orange, and yellow, with dark green conifers interspersed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses bold hues of red, orange, and yellow in a stylized pattern, suggesting autumn tones. However, the design lacks distinct representations of trees, particularly conifers, seen in conventional styles. The abstraction primarily focuses on vibrant color contrasts over detailed tree depiction. Image A distinctly portrays autumn-colored trees along with interspersed dark green conifers, offering a clear narrative of a seasonal landscape.",
