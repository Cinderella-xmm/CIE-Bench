    "Question": "Q1: Does the realistic cat figure retain the cream-colored body with dark brown points on the ears, face, paws, and tail?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cat figure is positioned next to the packaging. It is crafted as a chibi-style object rather than realistic, featuring a simplified design. Its body predominantly displays shades of beige or cream, with contrasting darker points on the ears, face, paws, and tail characteristic of Siamese cats. This design simulates the color pattern from Image A, which features a realistic Siamese cat sitting on a windowsill.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the realistic cat figure have bright blue eyes with visible reflections?",
    "explanation": "The cat figure in Image B showcases large, stylized bright blue eyes with vibrant reflections, which is characteristic of the chibi aesthetic.

    "Question": "Q3: Is the tail of the realistic cat figure curled tightly around its body, forming a dark ring underneath?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tail of the cat figure is sculpted to encircle the base in a rounded manner, resembling the realistic cat's tail positioning in Image A, where it forms a visible ring pattern beneath the body. This shape in Image B presents a rounded foundation typical of stylized figures.",

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the small ceramic vase with blue floral pattern and pinkish-purple spherical flowers present on the windowsill?",

    "Question": "Q6: Does the realistic cat figure display smooth, softly shaded fur with natural gradients and texture?",

    "Question": "Q7: Is the window frame and outdoor landscape (trees, hills, overcast sky) visible in the background?",
