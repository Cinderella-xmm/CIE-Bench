      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a horse that features a black bridle running along its face and jawline, which is a common design for decorative and display purposes, especially in art and crafts. This visual element is consistent with representations of bridled horses.",

      ],

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the decorative pattern on the horse's flank shows red roses that are likely mirrored on both sides of the horse given the symmetrical design intent typically found in such patterns. The visual symmetry is characteristic of the artwork's style.",
