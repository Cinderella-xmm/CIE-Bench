    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the angular, filigree-patterned metallic mask covering the upper face, including the prominent crest and eye-covering section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fairy keychain features a mask with angular filigree patterns. The mask includes prominent crest-like elements, enhancing its regal appearance, with sections that suggest coverage of the upper face similar to a crown, which indicates a continuation of the mask design observed in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the butterfly wings retained with their original veined structure and mottled brown-orange coloration, even if rendered with a metallic or shimmering surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays butterfly wings with clear veined structures and a brown-orange mottled appearance. The wings have glossiness, likely due to a metallic material but retain the original color and pattern visible in Image A. This suggests consistency in wings design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the thin wire or cord extending from the base of the left wing still present and connected to the wing structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, there is no visible wire or cord extending from the base of the wings, unlike in Image A where this wire or cord is attached to the left wing. Analysis suggests the removal of this element in the edited depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fairy's outfit appears to maintain a fitted form with elegant embroidery throughout the torso, indicative of lace-like patterns. The halter-neck silhouette is replaced by a strapless design, differing notably from the outfit structure in Image A.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the fairy in a forward-facing position within the dome, contrasting with Image A where a side profile pose is evident with gazing forward. This marks a notable change in pose in the edited depiction.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the subject’s eyes closed and her lips painted red, matching the original appearance?",
      "choices": [

        "No"
      ],
