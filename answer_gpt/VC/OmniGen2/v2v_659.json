      "question": "Are the large, round brown eyes present and positioned symmetrically in the center of the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area where the eyes are expected to be is obscured, so it is not possible to determine their presence, shape, or symmetry. However, focusing solely on Image B without considering Image A, there's insufficient visible data to confirm the characteristic of eyes. Thus, based on Image B alone, the answer is inferred.",

      "question": "Is there a crown-like accessory present on the top of the head, resembling the original tiara in form and placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a crown-like accessory on top of the head that closely resembles the tiara in Image A in terms of form and placement. It appears to have a similar intricate design, indicative of a royal or ornamental theme, suggesting consistency in its form and placement with the original.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the face retain a soft oval shape with a small nose and a slight upward curve of the lips forming a gentle smile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not provide any information on the facial shape, the nose's appearance, or the curvature of the lips due to the blurring of the facial features. Thus, relying solely on Image B, it is not possible to confirm these elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the skin tone light and fair with a natural pinkish blush visible on the cheeks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since the face in Image B is obscured, it is not possible to determine the skin tone or any blush on the cheeks. Therefore, based on the available visual cue (or lack thereof), we can't ascertain the specific skin tone characteristics.",

      "question": "Are both ears visible and positioned naturally on the sides of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning and visibility of both ears are obscured, making it difficult to ascertain whether both ears appear naturally located on the sides of the head. That being said, some visual cue suggests one ear is visible in the expected natural location, although the other is not visible or verifiable.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair appears to be brown and styled in soft waves, framing the area where the face should be, consistent with common hairstyles that create gentle framing. This matches the visual cue of traditional brown hair styled in waves.",
