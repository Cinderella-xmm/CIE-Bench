      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the two-tiered roof with upward-curving eaves and ornamental ridge details preserved in the same structural outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stained-glass depiction maintains the fundamental shape and features of the roof seen in Image A, including the upward-curving eaves and detailed ridge. The artistic representation mimics the original architectural details using bold lines to define the structure. Therefore, the roof's structural outline is preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the large red moon positioned in the upper center of the sky and retaining its dominant red color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include the large red moon that is prominent in Image A. Instead, it uses red-colored glass panels in the stained-glass artwork, but these do not replicate the position or size of the moon. The moon is absent from the upper center, and its specific red coloring is not represented apart from the general theme.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there two red-colored trees symmetrically placed on the left and right sides of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stained-glass artwork does feature two red trees, placed symmetrically on either side of the building just like in Image A. The symmetry and color are preserved in a stylized form within the artwork, aligning with the original layout.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a reflective body of water in the foreground mirroring the building and moon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stained-glass depiction does not include a reflective body of water. The image is instead composed of glass segments, skipping the mirroring effect seen with the water in Image A. The reflection characteristic of Image A is therefore absent from Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there stone steps descending from the building platform toward the pond?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stained-glass interpretation includes steps descending from the building, similar to the stone steps leading towards the pond in Image A. However, since Image B does not contain a pond, these steps are present without the original context.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the windows on the building emitting a warm orange light, particularly on the upper and lower levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stained-glass artwork represents the windows with vibrant orange coloration, conveying the warm glow initially seen emitting from the windows in Image A. This choice maintains the lighting effect indicating warmth in both levels of the building.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there low green shrubs and manicured plants surrounding the base of the building and pond?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks the realistic greenery present in Image A. While green is used as a color in the stained-glass artwork, it doesnâ€™t explicitly mimic the detailed portrayal of shrubs and manicured plants from Image A. The artistic approach does not capture the surrounding vegetation.",
