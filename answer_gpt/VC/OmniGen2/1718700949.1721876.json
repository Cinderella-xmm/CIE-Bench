      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's trunk is depicted as being curved but not in an upward spiral. It is more of a natural, gentle curve than a distinct spiral. Therefore, utilizing visual analysis and common depiction of such shapes, we can conclude that the trunk is not curled in a spiral.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant’s ears are not fanned out to a full extent laterally. They appear more relaxed and rounded rather than fully extended. Based on visual interpretation of the ear positioning and using knowledge of resting ear positions, we can conclude they are not fully fanned out.",
