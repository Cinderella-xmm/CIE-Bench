      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the metallic mask with horn-like protrusions at the temples present and retaining its original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a cartoonish representation of the features found in Image A. The mask does not retain a metallic appearance but is instead depicted as part of the cartoon design. The horn-like protrusions are present but have taken on a stylized animated form, and therefore the original shape and texture are not preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red lips and visible lower face (including chin and jawline) clearly present and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower face features are obscured and stylized in a cartoonish manner. The lips and lower facial features are not distinctly represented as in Image A, which respects the realistic depiction of facial features. Therefore, these aspects are not unchanged.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the black hair styled in an updo with floral branches positioned symmetrically on both sides of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows black hair styled in an updo, with floral arrangements symmetrically placed on both sides of the head. This matches the description from Image A where floral branches including cherry blossoms are positioned similarly in the hair.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are cherry blossom branches visibly integrated into the hair on both sides of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image B and Image A feature the integration of cherry blossom branches into the hair on both sides. In Image B, the branches have been illustrated, maintaining symmetry and presence found in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the subject’s facial skin tone fair and uniformly lit, matching the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B transforms the subject into a cartoon representation which simplifies and alters any natural skin tone detail found in Image A. Therefore, the fair and uniformly lit complexion observed in the original realistic photo is not present in the edited image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the subject facing directly forward with a symmetrical pose and centered composition?",
      "choices": [

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the mask retain a textured, metallic surface appearance rather than becoming smooth or cartoonish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface details of any mask-like element have been transformed into a cartoonish appearance that lacks the realistic metallic texture found in Image A. Thus, the mask does not retain its textured, metallic surface appearance.",
