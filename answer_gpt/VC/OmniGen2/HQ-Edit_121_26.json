      "question": "Is the figure shown in profile, facing left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is shown slightly turned to the side, facing toward the castle on the right side of the image. This orientation can be identified by the direction the body is facing and the position of the staff, which is angled towards the right of the image. Therefore, the figure is not in profile facing left.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the right hand grip a long vertical object extending downward from the shoulder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's right hand is holding a long staff that extends vertically downward. This is visible by observing the hand's grip on the object that extends along the figure's arm and body. This indicates that the right hand is indeed gripping a vertical object extending downward from the shoulder.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors in the image golden, ochre, and earthy browns, consistent with the original sunset lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B predominantly features shades of gold and ochre in the armor and the landscape, while the cape and other elements incorporate earthy tones. This combination of colors creates a warm atmosphere, similar to the impression of sunset lighting. Despite being a different environment than Image A, the colors are still consistent with the warm tones of a sunset scene.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the legs positioned slightly apart, with weight distributed evenly, suggesting a stable stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the legs of the figure appear to be slightly apart, with feet planted firmly on the ground. This positioning usually suggests an even distribution of weight, indicating a stable and strong stance. The alignment and spacing of the legs convey stability.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the left arm relaxed and hanging straight down along the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left arm does not hang straight down but is bent to hold onto an object, suggesting engagement rather than relaxation. The posture of the arm can be seen carried with intention rather than relaxed alongside the body.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the figure located in the foreground, with open space behind it leading to distant hills or structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is prominently positioned in the foreground. The background features open space with hills and a castle visible in the distance, creating depth in the image. This setting situates the figure against a broad landscape setting, confirming its presence in the foreground with distant structures behind.",
