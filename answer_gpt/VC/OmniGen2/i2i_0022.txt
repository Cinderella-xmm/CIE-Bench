    "Question": "Q1: Is the cat depicted in a curled-up position with one paw visibly stretched out?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is depicted in a curled-up position, but both paws appear to be tucked in rather than stretched out. The image is a cartoon sticker representation rather than a real photo, focusing on a simplified, playful depiction of a cat's typical resting pose.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the cat shown lying on a curved surface representing the car's hood?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is part of a sticker illustration with no indication of a surface like a car hood. Instead, the cat is depicted in isolation with no interaction with any specific surface or background context, as is typical in sticker designs.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there reflection lines present on the curved surface under the cat?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no reflection lines or indications of a surface under the cat, as it is a simplistic sticker illustration focused solely on the depiction of the cat itself. Reflection lines typically suggest a glossy or reflective background, which is absent here.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the entire sticker image surrounded by a thick white outline?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the entire sticker image is surrounded by a thick white outline, which is common in many sticker designs to define the boundary of the sticker and enhance its visual appeal against varied backgrounds.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the sticker have a transparent background behind the outlined image?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a sticker with a design element comprising a defined outline surrounding the main illustration. Typically, stickers are designed this way to create the impression of a clear or transparent background outside the outline when applied to a surface. The background within the white outline is clear or unified with the surrounding environment when the picture is isolated.",
    "answer": "Yes"
