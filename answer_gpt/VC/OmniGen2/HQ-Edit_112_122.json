      "question": "Is the dress clearly divided into a red upper section and a dark blue lower section, forming a visible gradient?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress worn by the woman in each illustration is clearly divided into a red upper section and a dark blue lower section, forming a visible and distinct color contrast rather than a gradient. The stark separation of colors is evident, aligning with common design choices where two-tone dresses have a clear division between the colors.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dress appear to be in motion, with the fabric fanning outward and upward as if caught in a twirl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration style depicts the dress as if it is in motion. The fabric of the dress fans outward, enhancing the perception of dynamic movement, suggesting that the woman might be twirling or in motion, typical of portrayals of motion with swirling skirts.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the womanâ€™s right arm extended forward and her left arm raised, with her left hand lifting the edge of the dress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B shows that in the illustrations, the woman's pose varies. However, her right arm is generally lowered or aligned with the dress's flow, and her left arm doesn't appear to lift the dress edge. The poses depicted suggest more graceful, dance-inspired movements than holding up a garment.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the woman have long, wavy, golden-brown hair flowing behind her?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustrations depict the woman with long, flowing, wavy hair, though it appears more of a dark brown with lighter highlights, creating a glowing effect. The depiction emphasizes the dynamic flow of the hair as part of the scene's motion.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there dense clusters of pink flowers on the left side and yellow spherical flowers on the right side of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background does not match the description. Instead, the frames contain floral elements and designs around the woman, but they do not depict an entire scene with distinct flower clusters on specific sides. Rather, flowers appear as decorative elements around the frames.",
      "weight": 2,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a bright, warm light source coming from the top right, illuminating the woman and casting a golden glow on the right side of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a panel that stylizes a sunlit design with rays emanating from the top but does not project a realistic, warm light source casting a golden glow on the woman. The overall illustration emphasizes bright and colorful backgrounds, providing a warm ambiance.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the woman have closed eyes, a gentle smile, and a visible silver hoop earring on her left ear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the abstract and stylized nature of the illustrations and the deliberate obscuring of the facial details, there is no clear depiction of facial expressions, closed eyes, or earrings. This stylistic choice emphasizes anonymity and fantasy rather than specific character traits.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each illustration indeed shows pink petals, some floating around the woman. This adds to the dynamic movement of the scene, creating a whimsical and lively atmosphere typical of artistic representations involving nature or romantic themes.",
