      "question": "Are the carrot slices clearly circular in shape with visible concentric rings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot slices are visible as having a circular shape which is characteristic when carrots are cut crosswise. The slices show concentric circles, which are typical of carrot slices due to the natural texture and pattern of the carrot when cut. This observation aligns with common understanding of how cross-sectional slices appear in vegetables like carrots.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the cauliflower florets retain their natural branching structure and clustered bud formation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the cauliflower florets display the typical branching structure and clustered bud appearance characterized by small, compact flower buds grouped together. This visual information reflects the ordinary presentation of cauliflower florets, utilizing world knowledge about their natural structure.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are all the carrots and cauliflower florets contained within the bowl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrots and cauliflower florets appear to be within the confines of the bowl, which is visible due to their arrangement and the clear lip of the bowl that surrounds them. This containment is consistent with the expectation of how vegetables are placed within a bowl for presentation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the arrangement of vegetables in the bowl natural and non-symmetrical, with both carrots and cauliflower present in similar quantities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of the vegetables appears somewhat symmetrical and organized rather than having a random or naturally uneven distribution. The quantity of the carrots and cauliflower might differ with visually discernible dominance of carrots due to their bright color and noticeable size. This insight comes from visual assessment and understanding typical arrangements of mixed vegetables.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the carrots distinctly orange and the cauliflower distinctly white in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays carrots as distinctly orange, which matches their known color, and cauliflower florets as white, reflecting their usual appearance. The choice of color consistently represents their natural state and provides clarity without deviation from expectation based on common knowledge about these vegetables.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there multiple distinct carrot slices and cauliflower florets visible in the bowl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows multiple carrot slices and cauliflower florets clearly visible and identifiable, capturing a variety in both kinds of vegetables present. This observation shows diversity and multitudes of the individual types, which aligns with what is typically seen in a mixed vegetable bowl.",
