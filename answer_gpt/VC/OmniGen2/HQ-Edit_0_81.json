      "question": "Is the elderly man’s full white beard clearly visible and present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly man’s face is blurred, making it impossible to clearly see any facial features, including a full white beard. Based on this visual information, it is reasonable to conclude that a visible beard is not present.",

      "question": "Is the white turban wrapped around the man’s head in a traditional style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although part of the head is blurred, the clear visible portion suggests a white turban is wrapped around the man's head. Traditional styles often involve wrapping fabric to cover the head entirely, which reflects common cultural practices. The visible portion of the turban aligns with this, suggesting it is indeed wrapped traditionally.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The man in Image B appears to be standing upright, holding a walking stick in his right hand and a wooden box in his left hand, suggesting his arms are extended to hold these objects. His body position is straightforward with no apparent orientation to the left, based on the angle and posture visible.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is indeed holding what seems to be a carved wooden box in his left hand, which contains a bouquet of orange and pink flowers. This is directly observable from the image, as the colors and forms of the flowers are distinct.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ground in Image B is composed of light-colored tiles, which visually resemble square stone tiles. The arrangement in the image suggests a grid-like pattern due to the regular alignment and form of the tiles, which typically appears in such settings.",
