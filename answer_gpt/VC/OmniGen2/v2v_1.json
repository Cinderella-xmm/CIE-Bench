      "question": "Does the image retain the metallic texture and finish of the bearings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bearings appear to have a metallic texture with a shiny and reflective surface, indicating that the metallic finish is still visible. This observation is consistent with what is commonly expected of metal objects, which are known to have reflective surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the shape and structural details (rings, grooves) of the bearings accurately represented?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bearings with distinct structural details such as rings and grooves that are typical features of bearings. These elements are crucial for their function and are visibly present, suggesting accurate representation of shape and details.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the bearings maintain their relative positions and orientations as shown in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the bearings arranged in a different setup, likely in a box and with additional bearings visible. A comparison with Image A shows that the original layout is altered in terms of positioning and orientation.",
      "weight": 2,

      "question": "Is the text \"Facts You Need to Know about Bearings and Final Drive Motors\" still present on the chalkboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display the original text on the chalkboard. It contains different text that appears to be distorted and incomprehensible, which shows a change from the original text visible in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the background remain clean and uncluttered, focusing attention on the bearings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes additional elements like a box with bearings, which make the scene more cluttered compared to Image A's simpler composition. The additional elements in Image B draw attention away from the singular focus on the bearings.",
