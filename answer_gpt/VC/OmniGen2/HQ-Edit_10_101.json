        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible hair or beard as the focus is on an article of clothing or a framed piece. The presence of hair and beard cannot be determined from this image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the subject’s glasses round with thin wire rims, positioned on the nose and ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B primarily features a cardigan and does not depict a person wearing glasses, as it is either an article of clothing or a framed piece. Therefore, any details regarding glasses are not visible or applicable here.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardigan displayed does have a dark teal turtleneck underneath it, clearly visible and centered in the frame. This is consistent with the description.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the cardigan have a high, folded collar and two visible buttons in a vertical line?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardigan features a high folded collar and four visible buttons arranged vertically. While the collar is consistent with the description, the number of buttons does not match; thus, the original statement does not fully represent the cardigan's design in this image.",
      "weight": 3,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a floral background featuring roses and leaves, but the background is on a cream surface, not teal as described. Therefore, Image B presents a floral and vine pattern but with colors that differ from the stated details.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks framed paintings. Instead, the focus is on the cardigan itself within a frame, with the floral wallpaper background serving only as decoration. Therefore, there are no paintings posed symmetrically as described.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the subject seated and turned slightly to the right, with a soft smile and upward gaze?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a person; rather, it features a cardigan in a frame. Thus, any reference to an individual’s pose, facial expression, or orientation does not apply here.",
