      "question": "Is the basketball present and being held in the player’s right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the player is depicted in an animated style and does not hold a basketball in their hand. Instead, illustrations of the player are shown, which do not include a basketball as part of the imagery. This can be concluded from examining the visual cues, which do not feature a basketball compared to Image A's depiction of a real-life scene where the player was holding the ball.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the player in a low crouch with the right leg bent and the left leg extended backward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the player in an animated style, and the posed position is standing rather than in a low crouch; the legs are depicted as actively moving forward, indicative of a basketball action pose, rather than crouched with a leg extended backward. Thus, the character's stance in the illustration does not match the described low crouch position seen in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the player wear a sleeveless blue jersey with black trim around the neckline and armholes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the player is drawn in a sleeveless jersey; however, the player's attire includes variations, such as a sleeveless orange jersey and a sleeveless blue jersey without clear black trim, highlighting a difference in style from Image A's real-life depiction. Consequently, the particular jersey design features observed in Image A do not correspond to those in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there black knee pads visible on both knees of the player?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are illustrated in an animated format and do not feature any knee pads. The animations focus more on a stylized representation than including physical gear such as knee pads, which is more evident in Image A's realistic depiction. The characters' legs are bare in the illustration, confirming the absence of knee pads.",

      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the player's shoes in stylized illustrations, which reflect a design akin to Image A with the black, blue, and orange coloration visible on the character's shoes, suggesting consistency in the shoe design. The details align similarly with the real-life depiction from the original image.",

      "question": "Is there a graffiti-covered wall directly behind the player and beneath the basketball hoop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surroundings consist of vibrant, graffiti-style artwork behind the illustrated figures; however, there is no basketball hoop shown above this graffiti. Instead, the graffiti forms a backdrop for the animated elements rather than being related to specific sporting equipment or structures seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a basketball hoop with a red rim and white net mounted on a backboard above the graffiti wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks a depiction of a basketball hoop, as the focus is solely on the illustrated characters and background design without sports court features. Image A includes a real-world hoop above the graffiti wall, whereas Image B omits this particular piece of equipment, focusing entirely on character artwork.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shifts focus away from detailing a sports court surface; it emphasizes graphic character art against a colorful backdrop rather than illustrating a basketball court setting. This stylistic approach makes traditional court surfaces, like the blue and white-marked one in Image A, absent in Image B.",
