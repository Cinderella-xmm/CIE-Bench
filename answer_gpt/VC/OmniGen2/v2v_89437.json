        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'ALSC' logo is indeed present in the bottom right corner; however, the text and design differ from the description. The logo text is in red and does not have the full name in black capital letters below, which can be a modification from a standard company logo, where such elements are generally present.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the first orange circle icon is not a white magnifying glass over a document. Instead, the icon appears to resemble some other structure, likely with text characters inside, which does not match the description.",
