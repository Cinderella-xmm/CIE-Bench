        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow has a distinct pattern of darker feathers under its chin, which resembles the black bib seen in sparrows. This is a notable feature that identifies sparrows, and the visual cue in Image B shows it clearly.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue tit clearly exhibits bright blue coloring on its head along with vibrant yellow on its chest.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow and blue tit are positioned such that they are facing each other. This is indicated by their heads being directed towards one another, suggesting the same posture where they appear to be interacting or posed in conversation. The visual evidence supports the idea that they retain this posture.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the sparrow and the blue tit have clear and noticeable black eyes. This feature is significant in portraying the typical appearance of these birds, as their eyes tend to be striking black against their colorful feather patterns. The visual cues confirm that both birds have retained this characteristic.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both birds are perched on what appears to be a small base, with their feet visibly gripping the surface. Although the context differs from Image A, where they were on a natural branch, the presence of their feet and the gripping posture remains clear. Thus, observing their feet and how they are positioned confirms their visibility and gripping action.",
