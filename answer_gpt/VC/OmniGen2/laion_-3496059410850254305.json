      "question": "Is the Fender logo visible on the headstock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the headstock features tuning pegs and the shape commonly associated with guitars. The Fender logo is typically located on the headstock, discernible by its unique script style. In the edited image, the headstock is visible, but upon careful examination, there does not appear to be any distinctive logo or branding visible on it. Therefore, based on the visual analysis, the logo is not visible.",

      "question": "Are there exactly six strings running from the bridge to the tuning pegs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar shows strings stretched across the fretboard from the bridge to the tuning pegs. Based on common guitar design, six strings represent a standard configuration for acoustic guitars. Visually counting the strings in this edited image, there are indeed six strings visible. Therefore, the conclusion is based on the typical structure and the visible details in the image.",

      "question": "Is there a cutaway on the upper right side of the guitar body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar body shape indicates a relatively conventional dreadnought shape. The upper right side typically refers to the side of the body near the neck for right-hand guitars. Upon examining the guitar outline in the edited image, there is no cutaway visible on the upper right side; the guitar maintains a non-cutaway shape. This reasoning relies on the visual pattern and standard dreadnought design knowledge.",

      "question": "Is the soundhole located in the center of the guitar body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a guitar with a large circular opening, which is the soundhole, commonly found in the center region of the guitar body in acoustic designs. Analyzing the image, the soundhole appears to be centrally positioned concerning the vertical orientation of the guitar body. This is typical for acoustic guitars and aligns with the visual observation.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the neck extend directly from the body to the headstock without significant deviation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar neck appears straight, leading directly from the body to the headstock without any visible bends or angles. This straight extension is common among acoustic guitars, allowing for a continuous fretboard for easy playability. Observing the image confirms this straightforward alignment from neck to headstock.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The headstock in Image B shows tuning pegs necessary for adjusting string tension. Based on typical design for acoustic guitars, there are usually six tuning pegs, three on either side of the headstock. Upon examining these tuning pegs in the edited image, there are indeed three on each side, supporting the conclusion.",

      "question": "Does the guitar body retain the classic dreadnought shape with a rounded lower bout and a cutaway on the upper right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The classic dreadnought guitar shape features a large, rounded lower bout and may or may not include a cutaway. In Image B, the guitar maintains a traditional rounded larger lower bout typical of dreadnought shapes, but lacks a cutaway in the upper right area. This examination highlights that the guitar does not maintain a cutaway despite having other dreadnought features.",
