      "question": "Is the blue car in the upper left position still rendered in blue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue car is now in the lower section of the image, depicted on the right side next to a cereal bowl, indicating a change in position compared to Image A, where it was on the upper left. The car retains its blue color in Image B, visually consistent with its appearance in Image A as a blue-colored car on the trailer. Therefore, despite the change in position, the car's color is still blue.",

      "question": "Does the red car in the upper middle position retain the compact sedan body shape with a sloped roofline and four doors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red car located in the upper middle position has a similar compact sedan body shape with a sloped roofline and visibly has four doors. By analyzing the design features seen in the edited image, we conclude the body shape is consistent with common features of a compact sedan as depicted in Image A.",

      "question": "Are there exactly eight cars depicted in the final image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, only three cars are prominently displayed—yellow, pink, and blue—and they do not appear to be part of a larger vehicle haul as seen initially in Image A. Image A contains a total of seven cars being transported on a trailer. Thus, the edited image does not maintain the quantity of eight cars as it lacks the full set of vehicles simultaneously displayed.",

      "question": "Is the yellow car located in the upper middle-right position still yellow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the yellow car in the foreground and maintains its bright yellow color similar to Image A where this car was positioned in the upper middle-right position on the trailer. The continuity of color confirms that the yellow hue is preserved in both images.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does each car have four wheels, with two at the front and two at the rear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the cars depicted show standard automobile features consistent with typical car design, including four wheels—two on each side, indicating positions at the front and rear. Although only parts of some cars are visible, the visible cars maintain their structural integrity similar to Image A's design, affirming this common automobile characteristic.",

      "question": "Is the red car in the lower right position still red and retains the compact sedan shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car's characteristics become indistinguishable from those seen in Image A. The red car situated in Image A as a compact sedan on the trailer does not appear in the lower right position or visibility in Image B. The prominent red car shown slightly differs due to its position change, and its shape maintains coherence with Image A's typical car design but lacks visual verification as a red compact sedan in the same position.",
