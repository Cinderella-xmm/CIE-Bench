      "question": "Is the character wearing a rust-orange jacket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show a character wearing a rust-orange jacket, which is a warm, dark orange color. This can be identified through the color representation on the character's clothing. As the perception of colors can be consistent across both drawings and illustrations, common knowledge about color names helps determine that this is indeed a rust-orange jacket.",

      "question": "Is the snowboard positioned under the character’s feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are all depicted standing on snowboards. The snowboard is directly under each character’s feet, representing the act of snowboarding. Knowledge of how a snowboard is typically used—being stood upon for balance and movement—supports the conclusion that the snowboard is indeed under the character's feet.",

      "question": "Does the character wear a black helmet with red-tinted goggles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, many characters are illustrated with helmets that appear black. However, the reflection or tint on the goggles can be inferred through a reddish hue commonly seen in snowboarding goggles. World knowledge regarding snowboarding gear suggests such combinations for protective purposes, thus indicating that the character may wear a black helmet with red-tinted goggles.",

      "question": "Does the character have long brown hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, most characters have visible distinct hair colors and styles. The keychain that has a blurred face, however, does not show visible hair details due to the blurring; hence, without specific visual cues or color representation, we cannot conclude the presence of long brown hair in the edited illustration.",

      "question": "Are the character’s pants black?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual representation of the characters in Image B tends toward simple color palettes commonly used for clothing details. Many characters are depicted with dark trousers, which can visually be recognized as black, indicating that the pants are black.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the character fully visible in the image, with no body parts cut off?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the representations provide a full view of the characters without limbs or body parts being cut off within the individual keychain frames. By understanding the illustration's layout of the design for visibility and recognition, one can infer all parts are depicted in entirety.",

        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the context of Image B, the depiction of gloves is generally noted as part of the snowboarding attire for protection against cold. The gloves are generally illustrated as dark or black, consistent with how snowboarding gloves are typically represented.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the background of each keychain in the forefront shows simple snowy landscapes that imply general winter settings. While evergreen trees are commonly associated with such landscapes, the given illustration has designs of snowy surfaces but lacks specific tree details immediately perceivable.",
