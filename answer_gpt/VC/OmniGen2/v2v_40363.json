        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, although the style has changed to a more cartoonish and tiled pattern, the shape of the child in terms of posture and positioning relative to the elements like the balloons seems to have been retained. The child still reaches out towards the balloon, maintaining the general outline and direction of the original position.",

        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "The round red balloon in the edited image is positioned on top of the child's head, similar to the original image, maintaining a recognizable round shape. Despite the stylistic change to a tiled design, its location and shape correlate with the original image.",

        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the heart-shaped balloon exists in the upper portion of the scene, similar to the original mural. Its shape has been preserved consistent with the heart design seen in the initial image, despite the transformation to a cartoonish, tiled style.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "The gesture of reaching out by the child is preserved in the edited image, evident from the child extending an arm towards the direction of the heart-shaped balloon. Thus, the child's pose in terms of reaching is consistent with the original image.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image keeps the relative positioning of the elements, with the round red balloon on top of the child's head and the heart-shaped balloon in a specific direction towards which the child is reaching. Though the style has been altered, the spatial arrangement remains unchanged.",
