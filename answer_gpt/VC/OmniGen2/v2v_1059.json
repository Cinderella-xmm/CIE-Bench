      "question": "Are the zebras' bodies covered in distinct black and white stripes that follow the natural pattern seen in the original image, including variations in thickness and alignment across the torso, legs, and face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras are depicted with black and white stripes that cover their bodies. However, upon inspecting the edited image closely, these stripes lack the natural irregularities and variations usually seen in actual zebra patterns. The stripes are more uniform, and the alignment is overly consistent, resembling a stylized rendition rather than the real thing. In contrast, Image A has zebras with more naturally varying stripe patterns, consistent with actual zebras. This artistic editing choice results in a more homogenous appearance in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is each zebra depicted with its head lowered toward the ground in a natural grazing pose, with legs positioned to support this stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras are shown with their heads lowered, which mimics a natural grazing posture. The positioning of their legs supports their stance, indicating that they are engaging in grazing. This stance is similar to the more natural depiction seen in Image A. The grazing posture is a common behavior in zebras, which is captured effectively in both images despite the stylization of Image B.",

      "question": "Is the horizontal wire fence with evenly spaced wooden posts clearly visible across the mid-ground of the image, separating the field from the treeline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a horizontal fence with evenly spaced posts, which is clearly depicted in the mid-ground. This is consistent with world knowledge regarding fencing in fields. Comparing this with Image A, the fence in the latter is slightly more detailed but follows the same structure and placement, effectively separating the field from the treeline. Thus, the fence's representation is clear in both images.",

      "question": "Is the ground covered in green grass with visible patches of bare soil and small green shrubs scattered throughout the field?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground is depicted as uniformly covered in green grass without any bare soil patches or small shrubs, which differs from natural terrain representation. In contrast, Image A shows patches of missing grass and small shrubs, offering a more realistic portrayal of a field. The artistic choice in Image B favors a clean and stylized depiction of grass without the variability seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Is there a continuous line of green trees and bushes behind the fence, with a clear light blue sky above the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a line of green trees and bushes behind the fence, along with a light blue sky above, which is consistent with typical landscape imagery. Comparing this to Image A, the layout of the trees and sky is similar, but the editing has given Image B a more polished and idealized look compared to the more natural presentation in Image A.",

      "question": "Do the zebras have short, upright manes composed of alternating black and white stripes, consistent with their body patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras are shown with short, upright manes featuring black and white stripes. Although the stripe pattern on the manes is consistent with the body pattern, it looks more stylized compared to the natural variation on zebra manes seen in Image A. The manes in Image B are uniformly styled and don't reflect the natural, less regular stripe patterns found in actual zebras.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras' hooves are depicted as dark and positioned on the ground in a way that supports their grazing posture. This aligns with the anatomical and behavioral characteristics associated with zebras, as they support their bodies while grazing. Image A also shows the hooves in a similar position, confirming the stance in both images.",
