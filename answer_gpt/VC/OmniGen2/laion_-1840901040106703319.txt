    "Question": "Q1: Are the three triangular windows positioned at the apex of the A-frame roof clearly present and maintaining their triangular shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the structure appears to be a geometric glass building rather than a traditional cabin with an A-frame roof and triangular windows. The roof structure does not support the presence of any windows, especially triangular ones at the apex of a roof. Based on this analysis, no triangular windows are visible or applicable to this structure.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the cabin structured with a raised deck on the upper level and a garage on the lower level, maintaining the same vertical separation?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a geometrically stylized glass and crystal structure rather than a traditional cabin with multiple levels. There are no levels or traditional architectural elements such as a raised deck or a garage present in this image. Therefore, the elements of vertical separation between a deck and a garage are not applicable.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the garage door located on the right side of the lower level, adjacent to the main entrance?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not show any traditional architectural features such as a garage or main entrance, since it is a conceptual geometric structure. There are no visible doors or entrances, particularly a garage door on the lower level.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the cabin symmetric about its central vertical axis, with the roof peak, main entrance, and supporting columns aligned centrally?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the structure is a polyhedral glass form rather than a traditional cabin. There is no central peak of a roof, main entrance, or support columns to assess symmetry. The geometric shape may have its form of symmetry, but it's unrelated to the cabin features specified.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the vertical support columns beneath the deck present and positioned at regular intervals along the front facade?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not feature any traditional elements such as a deck or support columns, as it is a glass crystal-like structure. Hence, no vertical support columns can be found in front of a fa√ßade.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the small rectangular window located on the lower level, to the left of the main entrance, still present?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the structure is a faceted glass formation without traditional elements like windows or entrances. Therefore, there is no small rectangular window visible or related to any entrance.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the stone retaining wall made of large, irregular boulders visible on the right side of the cabin's base?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not include any traditional cabin or building base where a stone retaining wall could be present. It features a glass construction without any stone boulders visible.",
    "answer": "No"
