    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the Olympus brand name visible on the top of the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera brand name appears as 'Otvlv.' This suggests it's different from the original 'Olympus' seen in Image A, likely due to intentional alteration for stylistic reasons. The visual cue indicating an alteration to the brand name helps derive the conclusion.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a large circular lens at the front of the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera prominently features a large circular lens at the front, which is visually consistent with commonly known camera designs, including some models of the Olympus series. This observation helps affirm the presence of the circular lens.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are both hands visibly gripping the camera body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual in Image B clearly shows both hands of the individual positioned on either side of the camera, suggesting they are gripping the camera body. This depiction, typical for holding such devices, allows for the conclusion.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is a brown leather strap attached to the camera and extending over the shoulder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show a strap visibly attached to the camera or extending over the shoulder; rather, the focus remains largely on the camera itself without such accessory visuals. This absence helps conclude that the strap is not visible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there two flap pockets on the front of the denim jacket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jacket does not show visible flap pockets; it displays a stylized cartoon version where such details are either simplified or omitted. The recognition of typical denim jacket features supports the absence of flap pockets in this depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the white blouse have vertical ridges or pleats across the front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blouse in Image B lacks the detail of vertical ridges or pleats across the front, showcasing a smoother design typical of animated illustrations. This compares against Image A where such pleats are evident, confirming their absence in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a brown belt with a silver rectangular buckle around the waist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Checking Image B, the area around the waist is not illustrated in detail, and thus, no belt or buckle is visible. In comparison, Image A displays this accessory, supporting the conclusion of its absence in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the camera held at chest height, centered in front of the torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the camera held in a manner consistent with how individuals typically hold cameras, positioned at chest height and centered in front of the torso. This conclusion is based on recognizing the common mannerism of holding and positioning cameras.",
