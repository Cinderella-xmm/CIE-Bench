      "question": "Does the edited image retain the three-masted structure of the ship, with one mast at the front, one in the center, and one at the rear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, I observe a ship with its sails fully deployed. The structure clearly shows three masts: one positioned at the front, one centrally, and another towards the rear. This arrangement is a traditional three-masted structure commonly found on larger historic sailing ships. My analysis, integrating visual information with my understanding of ship design, suggests that the edited image maintains this setup.",

      "question": "Are the sails of the ship still dark blue in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sails appear to be a lighter, more natural sail color, possibly off-white or cream. This differs from Image A, where the sails are a distinct dark blue. The visual examination of the color change in Image B indicates a deliberate artistic choice, moving away from the darker hue.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the bow of the ship decorated with intricate carvings and scrollwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship's bow is visible, encased in a transparent dome, but the intricate carvings or scrollwork found on many historical ships' bows are not strongly evident visually. It appears to be a simplified model with focus on general ship representation rather than intricate detail.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible portholes along the side of the shipâ€™s hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the ship appears as a miniature model under glass, which may lack the finer details such as visible portholes. The ship model emphasizes sails and general shape over such intricate hull details. This suggests that portholes, prominent in real ships, are not clearly depicted or are absent in the edited image.",

      "question": "Do all three masts have multiple square sails stacked vertically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each mast of the ship holds multiple square sails stacked vertically, a feature characteristic of traditional sailing ships. Such design is consistent across all masts, with sails adequately spaced to show a layered, organized arrangement. In this miniature representation, the ship's sailing aspect is well captured.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the ship maintain its original silhouette with a tall, narrow hull and a pointed bow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the ship under a glass dome, but it retains a recognizable silhouette typical of historical galleons with a tall and narrow hull. However, the perspective might marginally change the perception, yet the structure remains evident. The pointed bow is evident in the design, maintaining the essential shape from Image A.",
