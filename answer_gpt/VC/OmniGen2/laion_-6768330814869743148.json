      "question": "Are there exactly four wooden trays arranged in a 2x2 grid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no wooden trays visible. Instead, the image is composed of stylized, colorful geometric patterns and shapes, with no indication of trays or any food presentation format typically associated with wooden trays arranged in a 2x2 grid. Image A shows four wooden trays, but this setup is absent in the edited image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the madeleines retain their distinctive shell-shaped form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pastries shown do not have the typical shell-shaped form characteristic of madeleines. Instead, they appear cartoonish and do not resemble actual baked goods. In Image A, madeleines are identifiable by their distinctive form, which does not appear in the edited image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the label reading \"Madeleine\" positioned near the tray containing shell-shaped pastries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature any labels, trays, or pastries, including those labeled 'Madeleine.' The graphic style of Image B does not retain any resemblance to the setup in Image A where a label would be positioned near the madeleines.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the word \"craster\" visibly engraved on the front of each of the four trays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no wooden trays or any engravings visible that resemble the word 'craster.' The image has been transformed into an abstract style piece with no clear text engraving present, as opposed to Image A where 'craster' is engraved on the trays.",

    {

      "question": "Is parchment paper visible inside each of the four trays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has been altered significantly from Image A. There are no trays, and consequently, no parchment paper is evident inside them. The image has been transformed into an abstract, colorful artwork, unlike Image A where parchment paper is visible inside the trays.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pastries do not have a discernible shape such as oval or slightly flattened. Instead, they are depicted in a highly stylized manner and do not resemble actual pastries from Image A. Image A has pastries in an oval, slightly flattened shape, which is absent in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the pastries in the bottom-left tray clearly shaped as sliced loaf bread with visible internal texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no pastries or bread visible that have the shape or texture of sliced loaf bread. The image consists of abstract forms, not resembling the pastries in Image A, where the bottom-left tray contains sliced loaf bread with visible texture.",
