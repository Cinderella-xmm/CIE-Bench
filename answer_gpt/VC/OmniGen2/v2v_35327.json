      "question": "Is the figureâ€™s skin uniformly colored in a vivid blue tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image clearly depicts the figure's skin painted in a uniform and vivid blue tone. The visual cues of the image indicate no variation in the skin color as it covers the figure's entire visible body area. This is consistent with artistic styling where a monochromatic treatment is applied for aesthetic purposes.",

      "question": "Is the banana rendered in a metallic gold color with a curved, elongated shape resembling a real banana?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the banana appears in a metallic gold color, which is highly reflective and has a metallic sheen. Its shape is elongated and curved, closely resembling a real banana, as indicated by common visual characteristics associated with bananas. The metallic color provides a stylized emphasis typical in artistic renderings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, ears) clearly visible and anatomically recognizable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the facial features such as eyes, nose, and mouth are obscured by a graphical alteration. Therefore, they are not clearly visible or anatomically recognizable as a human face. This is consistent with the intentional manipulation of image features, directly affecting recognizability.",
      "weight": 3,

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the hand visible and positioned near the banana, suggesting a prior or ongoing interaction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand is indeed visible and positioned holding the banana, which suggests ongoing interaction as the fingers are wrapped around the fruit. The hand's posture indicates a grasp or hold, commonly seen in images depicting interaction with objects.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts the figure in a side profile with the head turned slightly forward, facing right. This is discerned by observing the orientation of the planes of the face and the positioning of the features such as the visible ear and the direction of the gaze, which is consistent with persons viewed in profile.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there is a visible background featuring abstract geometric shapes floating around. The presence of these shapes and the vibrant color contrasts illustrate a transformed artistic background, which is clearly intended to provide visual context or decoration.",
