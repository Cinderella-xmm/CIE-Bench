      "question": "Is the bag still rectangular in shape with rounded corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bag maintains a box-like shape that is consistent with a rectangular form and features rounded corners. The structure and contours of the bag's body fit the description of being rectangular with rounded corners. Thus, based on the visual cues in Image B, the bag is indeed rectangular with rounded corners.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the bag retain a flap-over front section with a horizontal crease?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a bag with a flap-over front section, but it is designed differently compared to typical horizontal creases. Instead, it features detailed and contrasting visuals that alter the appearance of any creases, yet the flap itself remains. Thus, the flap-over design remains even if the horizontal crease is not distinct.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a zipper running across the top edge of the bag with a visible gold-tone pull tab?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image B clearly shows a zipper along the top edge of the bag. The zipper includes a gold-tone pull tab which is clearly visible, indicating the function and style of the closure system at the top of the bag based on typical designs found in luxury bags.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there two vertical stitched panels visible beneath the flap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beneath the flap, the design does not distinctly show two separate vertical stitched panels as may be implied in common design formats. Instead, there is intricate detailing and patterns in the area that alter the traditional appearance of vertical stitched panels. Thus, the answer is based on lack of clarity on traditional vertical panels.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, we observe an adjustable shoulder strap attached to the bag. The shoulder strap ends are furnished with brass-colored hardware that resembles buckles, fitting the description provided. This matches common features found on designs for shoulder bags.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, the bag is displayed horizontally and appears upright, being processed in the middle section of the frame. This aligns with typical presentation in fashion or catalog imagery to emphasize focus on the product.",
