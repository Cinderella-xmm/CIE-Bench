    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the Great Wall depicted as a continuous, zigzagging structure following the contours of the mountain ridges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure inside the snow globe is visually represented as a part of the Great Wall. While it curves and follows an upward path, it doesn't show the full extent of zigzagging contours typical of its usual mountain ridge trajectory due to the constraints of the globe format. Based on the constraints and design of a snow globe, such a depiction cannot fully capture the zigzagging nature of the Great Wall over mountain ridges.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the walls constructed with visible gray stone bricks and topped with crenellated battlements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniaturized wall inside the snow globe is depicted with a simplified, stylized design that does not show the detailed texture or color typical of gray stone bricks. Additionally, the battlements are suggested in form but may not align entirely with the crenellated style due to the snow globe's artistic and simplified nature.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there watchtowers visible at regular intervals along the wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Great Wall is depicted in a minimalistic form within a snow globe, focusing primarily on a short section with visible figures and structural features, excluding watchtowers. The limited space of the snow globe does not accommodate for regular watchtower intervals.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the trees surrounding the wall display bright autumn colors, including yellow, orange, and red foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surroundings inside the snow globe hint at some stylized greenery and minimal autumn features. While there are simplified clusters indicating greenery, the color transitions to a full depiction of bright autumn foliage are limited within the compact, artistic snow globe setting.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a large, rounded rock formation embedded near the right side of the wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe includes a rock formation prominently at the base of the visible section of the wall. This representation corresponds to a similar rock feature near the right side in Image A, suggesting consistency in placement despite the stylized context.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are multiple small figures visible walking along the wall, with some ascending stairs and others standing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a series of small figures or silhouettes positioned along the scaled-down wall. These figures are in various postures, including ascending a portion of the wall that resembles stairs, reminiscent of pedestrian activity on the Great Wall.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there visible stone steps leading upward along the wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe displays a segment of the Great Wall that includes an upward path with steps. Although stylized, these steps suggest an inclined section similar to what one might expect on the actual Great Wall.",
