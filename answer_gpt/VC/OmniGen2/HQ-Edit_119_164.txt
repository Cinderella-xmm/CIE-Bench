    "Question": "Q1: Are the flat-topped acacia trees visible in the background, maintaining their characteristic silhouette and spacing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a cosmic scene with planets and stars, deviating from the natural African savanna setting. There are no acacia trees visible, as the scene is entirely different from a terrestrial landscape, focusing on a fantastic or sci-fi theme with a starry, galaxy-like background.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Is the tall, golden-brown savanna grass present throughout the foreground and midground, matching the original texture and density?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a cosmic scene with the elephant standing amidst a space-themed background. The ground lacks savanna grass, instead showing a stylized cosmic floor with glowing highlights and lacks the texture and density of natural grass.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the sky display a continuous gradient from warm orange near the horizon to deep red and purple at the top?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a cosmic setting with a dark space theme, accented by stars and planets, rather than a sky with natural color gradients. The sky is predominantly dark with vibrant colors illuminating parts of the elephant but lacks the continuous warm gradient of a typical sunset.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the horizon line clearly visible and straight, dividing the sky from the savanna landscape at approximately one-third up the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no discernible horizon line that separates a sky from a terrestrial landscape. The image portrays a fantastical space theme where the elephant appears amidst cosmic elements, removing any notion of a traditional horizon.",
    "answer": "No"
}
```

```json
{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the lighting consistent with a low-angle sunset, producing warm highlights on the upper surfaces of the elephant and grass, and casting long shadows behind the subject?",
    "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is dominantly artificial with neon-like hues and cosmic highlights, consistent with a space-designed artwork rather than natural dusk lighting. The highlights are blue and purple, lacking the warm tones typically produced by a sunset.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the elephant positioned centrally in the frame, facing directly toward the viewer with its body aligned vertically?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is indeed centrally positioned and oriented directly towards the viewer, maintaining its vertical alignment despite its abstract representation with cosmic colors and added elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

```json
{
    "Question": "Q7: Are there no visible water bodies, rocky outcrops, or other animals in the background beyond the acacia trees and grass?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not showcase any natural features like water bodies or rocky outcrops. However, it features planets and stars as part of its cosmic design, aligning with a space concept devoid of earthly elements such as acacia trees or grass.",
    "answer": "No"
}
```

```json
{
    "Question": "Q8: Do the grass blades in the foreground show individual strands with slight variation in length and direction, contributing to a natural texture?",
    "explanation": "There is no presence of grass or any natural vegetation in the foreground of Image B. The scene is transformed into a cosmic representation, eliminating terrestrial textures including grass strands.",
    "answer": "No"
}
