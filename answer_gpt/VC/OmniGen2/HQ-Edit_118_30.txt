    "Question": "Q1: Is the number '1902' clearly visible on the front of the locomotive?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, examining the front of the locomotive reveals the number '1907' rather than '1902'. Numbers are typically placed prominently on locomotives for identification, making them noticeable even from a distance. Therefore, the visibility and recognition are clear, but the number is not '1902'. The locomotive number has changed between Image A and Image B, likely as part of the artistic modification of the image.",
