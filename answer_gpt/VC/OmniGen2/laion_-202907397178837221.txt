    "Question": "Q1: Are the wooden truss supports of the railway bridge clearly visible and structurally intact?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scene depicts a futuristic cityscape with illuminated buildings and a digital-inspired design. The style is abstract and does not feature realistic elements such as wooden truss supports typical of a railway bridge structure. Thus, based on the visual cues and the theme of Image B, it is clear that wooden truss supports are not present—these would usually be visible in a more realistic depiction like Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Is the river present and flowing continuously beneath the bridge?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the futuristic and abstract style lacks natural elements like a river flowing beneath a bridge. The scene primarily focuses on neon-lit structures with no representation of natural features such as flowing water, which is indicated by the digital and geometric appearance lacking natural continuity. Comparing this with Image A, where a river is clearly present, confirms that Image B lacks such elements.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the red-brick buildings with gabled roofs and chimneys visible in the park area?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the cityscape is entirely futuristic and abstract with neon colors, focusing on skyscrapers and high-tech visuals. These do not include classical architectural elements like red-brick buildings with gabled roofs and chimneys. Image A displays these elements clearly as part of a realistic scene, which are absent in Image B, based on its visual styling.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the green lawns and paved pathways in the park area clearly visible?",
    "explanation": "Image B is designed with a neon-filled futuristic theme, absent of natural elements such as green lawns and paved pathways. The emphasis in Image B is more on digital landscapes and illuminated structures, which does not support the representation of green lawns or pathways, as seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the city skyline located behind the river and bridge, maintaining the original depth order?",
    "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the city's architectural style and depth differs greatly, characterized by a futuristic, neon-lit aesthetic that does not exhibit a traditional skyline arrangement with depth order behind a natural bridge or river. Image A shows a clear skyline order behind a bridge and river, which is absent in the digital approach of Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are two parallel railroad tracks visible along the length of the bridge?",
    "explanation": "Upon analysis of Image B, there are no visible elements resembling a conventional bridge with railroad tracks. The artistic representation focuses on abstract lines and colors, indicative of light pathways rather than actual structural tracks. Contrasting this with Image A, where railroad tracks are clearly visible along the bridge’s length, highlights their absence in Image B's futuristic style.",
    "answer": "No"
