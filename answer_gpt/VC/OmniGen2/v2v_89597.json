      "question": "Is the central touchscreen still positioned in the center of the dashboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the touchscreen is clearly positioned in the center of the dashboard, shown through its alignment and placement relative to surrounding dashboard features like the wooden trim and climate control graphics. The visual cues suggest that the touchscreen remains in the center despite any stylistic changes, indicating stability in its positioning, combining knowledge about car interior design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dashboard retain its general structure and placement relative to the steering wheel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dashboard with familiar elements such as the wooden trim and the touchscreen. The visually recognizable structure suggests a similar placement relative to the steering wheel due to common car design where these elements typically guide the layout. Comparing with Image A confirms the resemblance, supporting the idea that the dashboard structure and placement is retained.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the steering wheel still partially visible on the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a partially visible steering wheel on the left side, indicated by the round shape and position adjacent to the dashboard. World knowledge about typical steering wheel positioning in left-hand drive vehicles aids in identifying the steering wheel in Image B. The comparison with Image A, where the steering wheel is clearly visible in the same location, corroborates that it is indeed still visible in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the overall spatial arrangement of the vehicle's interior remain consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains a similar spatial layout where the touchscreen and dashboard elements are aligned similarly to Image A. The wooden panel, steering wheel visibility, and positioning of the central touchscreen contribute to recognizing a coherent spatial arrangement. Image A helps affirm this arrangement as a more straightforward rendering of the same features, confirming consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the airflow graphics on the screen still discernible, even if represented through calligraphic strokes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B still presents the airflow graphics, albeit in a stylized form that resembles calligraphic strokes. These graphics are identifiable by their context and placement on the touchscreen, near controls typically associated with airflow. By comparing with Image A, where airflow graphics are presented more clearly, the distinct central placement and graphical elements affirm their presence in Image B despite the artistic rendering.",
