      "question": "Is the bride’s hair blonde and styled in an updo with a pearl headband visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are depicted in a stylized format where specific hairstyles may not be represented in full detail. However, considering the common depiction of brides in illustrations, it is often characterized by blonde hair styled in updos with decorative accessories like headbands. Given the context of the illustration, it's logical to assume that the details like a pearl headband could be present symbolically rather than explicitly visible.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B represents the groom in a stylized format as well, where detailed facial features and hair texture are abstracted. However, typically, such character designs portray traditional groom features with short brown hair without emphasizing texture details such as stubble.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized format of characters does not clearly reflect intricate details of beadwork on attire, especially in the shoulders area. Such details are often simplified or omitted entirely in abstract artistic renditions.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the groom’s attire features a boutonniere, which is typically a floral element pinned to the lapel of a groom at weddings. Given the universal use of white flowers and leaves in such fashion details, it's reasonable to assume their presence despite stylistic representations.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the stylized Image B, specific jewelry details like necklaces, earrings, and bracelets are often abstracted and may not be distinctly visible due to the artistic nature. Thus, such intricate jewelry designs might not be explicitly observable.",
