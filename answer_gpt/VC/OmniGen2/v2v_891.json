      "question": "Does the edited image retain a central object resembling a monitor, even in a stylized form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central object prominently displays a rectangular screen, which is typically associated with a computer monitor in shape and positioning. Based on common knowledge, monitors are essential components of computer setups, which often occupy a central position in such arrangements. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer the edited image retains a central object resembling a monitor.",

      "question": "Does the edited image include an object resembling a speaker, even in a stylized form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects positioned on either side of the monitor have circular elements reminiscent of speaker cones in technical audio equipment, commonly known for projecting sound. With the addition of stylized design elements, these objects effectively represent speakers within the context of the edited image.",

      "question": "Does the edited image include an object resembling a computer tower, even in a stylized form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The second image contains a block-like figure adjacent to the monitor and keyboard, similar to a computer tower traditionally observed in desktop setups. This object housing the chibi character aligns with the common visual information and structural design of a computer tower, albeit with stylization.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an array of keys arranged sequentially below the make-believe monitor, mimicking the format and functional layout of a traditional keyboard, typically used for input in computer systems. This portrayal is highly stylized but visibly represents a keyboard within the scene.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Positioned slightly to the right of the keyboard within Image B exists a rounded, oblong shape. This piece shares common characteristics and recognizable features with a computer mouse, a common peripheral in computing setups. The stylization does little to alter the object's recognizable intent and function as a mouse.",
