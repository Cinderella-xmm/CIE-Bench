      "question": "Are the cabinet doors and drawers designed in a shaker style in both views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustrations depict different types of sink designs in a simple line-drawing style. Shaker-style cabinets typically have a flat center panel and square edges, which are not explicitly detailed in this illustration style. The simplistic drawing style does not detail any specific cabinet design such as shaker style. Without specific details indicating shaker style, the line drawings are too generic to be evaluated for this style. The question seems to expect a visual confirmation of detailed cabinet design styles, which is not feasible with the provided illustrations.",

      "question": "Do both the top-down and side views show two rectangular sink basins with consistent dimensions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are line drawings of multiple sink designs, each depicted separately. These drawings do not specifically indicate consistent dimensions between two views, and they do not show two rectangular sink basins within a singular, consolidated view. Each depiction stands alone as a separate design rather than complementary views of the same object. None of these designs represent a consistent top-down and side view combination for a singular type of sink.",

      "question": "Are the black faucets present above each sink basin in both views with the correct orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the line drawings do illustrate faucets above each sink basin. However, these drawings are cartoons, and the shading appears uniformly with a lack of specific color detailing such as black, and the depiction lacks intricate orientation details due to their simplistic nature. Thus, without color distinction or a detailed orientation, it is not possible to confirm the presence and correct orientation of black faucets based solely on these illustrations.",

      "question": "Is the countertop depicted in both views as a light-colored marble texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B consists of line drawings of different sink styles without textures indicating material properties like marble. The backgrounds are uniformly colored without any specific veining or texture to suggest a marble countertop. These illustrations focus on structural designs without material depiction, distinct from realistic renderings, making a determination regarding marble texture unfeasible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the compartments (drawers and cabinets) arranged in the same manner in both the top-down and side views, mirroring the original layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the line drawings depict standalone sink designs without drawers or cabinets, lacking any comprehensive illustration of compartment arrangements. The simplistic two-dimensional drawings focus on the sinks, not offering a view of any such compartments. Thus, they do not provide an arrangement of drawers and cabinets or mirroring of an original layout, contrasting with a real side view as opposed to a schematic representation.",
