      "question": "Does the image retain the oval-shaped black sink?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sink is a rectangular, integrated style with straight edges rather than the oval shape found in Image A. The surface appears to be white or light-colored rather than black. By contrasting the sink designs, itâ€™s clear that Image B offers a different sink style. Therefore, the sink is not oval-shaped in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a rectangular mirror, similar to Image A, and it retains the same orange backlight around it. The shape and illumination style remains consistent between the two images, indicating that this aspect has not been altered in the editing process.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B show a floating cabinet, which is mounted directly against the wall beneath the mirror. The position and installation style of the cabinet, as well as its floating nature, remain consistent across both images.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the faucets appear to be metallic, with a visible metallic sheen, typical of metal hardware. This differs from Image A, which features matte black hardware. This indicates a change from non-metallic to metallic faucets in the edited image.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the window is positioned next to the sink area, providing natural light to the space. Its location relative to the sink has been maintained in the edited image, signifying no change in this aspect.",
