      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), there is no visible vase at all. The image only features a flower pot with red flowers. There is no indication of a bulbous body, narrow neck, or flared rim associated with a vase, which confirms that these features are absent.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the flowers are clearly visible as predominantly red with green leaves. The red color of the petals and the green color of the foliage are consistent with what one would expect from similar floral arrangements. This direct observation indicates that the color scheme of the flowers has been retained.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), there is no visible vase. The image features only the flower pot without any vase present, unlike the original image (Image A) where the vase was visible next to the flower pot. This indicates that in the edited image, there is no vase positioned next to the flower pot.",

        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the edited image (Image B), the background is a light, beige color. This is consistent with what can be classified as a beige background. This suggests that the color of the background has been retained in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the surface beneath the flower pot is smooth and light-colored, similar to Image A. However, since there is no vase present, the comparison only involves the flower pot. The characteristic of being smooth and light-colored has been retained for the surface under the flower pot.",
