      "question": "Is the subject’s hair light blonde in color and visibly full and styled upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hair appears light blonde and is styled in a distinctly upward fashion. This can be observed through the use of bright colors, likely suggesting an intentional exaggeration characteristic of animated or cartoon styles. The fullness and upward style of the hair are prominent features. By combining these visual cues with knowledge of common hair styling in animations, it is reasonable to conclude that the hair is light blonde and styled upward.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the subject have a prominent forehead and wide jawline that define the facial structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the simplified cartoonish art style may not depict traditional anatomical features like a forehead and jawline. However, the exaggerated proportions that are common in cartoons often highlight such features to an extent. Therefore, assuming these exaggerated features are typical, it can be inferred there might be an intentional design to depict a prominent forehead and a wide jawline.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the subject’s right hand raised with the palm facing outward and fingers spread in a waving motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's right hand appears raised with the palm outward and fingers spread, suggesting a waving gesture. This is a common pose in illustrations depicting a friendly greeting or acknowledgment. The clarity of the gesture in the cartoon context aligns with the visual cues typically used to convey such a motion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a necktie visible under the suit jacket, positioned at the front of the shirt collar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of a necktie can be identified by the typical V-shape down the center of the front torso, under the suit jacket, associated with necktie designs. The vibrant color contrast of the necktie compared to the surrounding clothing helps in spotting its location below the shirt collar, making it visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the subject wearing a dark formal suit jacket over a white shirt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is wearing a colorful suit jacket with a bright pattern, which does not fit the description of a dark formal suit jacket. This suit jacket style and pattern are typical of more artistic or cartoon-based depictions, deliberately contrasting from more conventional attire.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the subject’s eyes directed forward, slightly toward the viewer’s left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the facial details are not visible due to the blurring, in cartoon representations, the head and face are often oriented directly forward, potentially implying the eyes would be following the same orientation. Without visible eyes, this is an inference based on positioning and typical cartoon design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is centrally placed in the frame and seems to be in an active pose, with arm raised signaling movement or presence towards the viewer, suggesting a mid-motion capture common in animated depictions of dynamic movement.",
