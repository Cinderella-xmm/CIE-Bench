      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a figure resembling a LEGO character is facing away from the viewer, walking along a street. The visual cue of the character's back being visible to the viewer and the direction the character is oriented suggest movement away from the observer. LEGO figures are often depicted in simple, easily recognizable postures, and this posture is consistent with walking away.",

      "question": "Does the man still hold a briefcase in his right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is holding a small, blocky object resembling a briefcase in its right hand, consistent with how a LEGO figure would hold such an accessory. This aligns with the standard design of LEGO accessories that are typically attached to the hand. This object looks similar to a briefcase due to its red color and rectangular shape.",

      "question": "Is the man wearing a denim jacket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure appears to wear a blocky representation of clothing, with colors and patterns that suggest a denim jacket. The LEGO character is dressed in all blue, which corresponds to the color typically associated with denim. However, since LEGO figures use simplified design patterns, the item mimicking a denim jacket primarily depends on color cues.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the street is represented with a pattern of raised bumps that bears a resemblance to a cobblestone path. The buildings line the street on both sides, consistent with the visual portrayal of a LEGO city environment. LEGO sets often replicate realistic elements in a simplified, stylized form, where cobbled streets would be depicted using raised patterns.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the street is flanked by blocky structures, intended to replicate buildings. The LEGO set structures are simplified representations of buildings, maintaining the general shapes such as vertical facades and window placements, which match the description of buildings in a stylized form.",
