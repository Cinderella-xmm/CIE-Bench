      "question": "Does the edited image retain the yellow color and cubed arrangement of the mango?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango displays a vibrant yellow color and a cubed arrangement. The cubes are distinct and stacked in a way that is consistent with how mangoes are commonly cut for consumption. This indicates that the edited image retains these characteristics. Image A helps verify the consistency in color and arrangement as it shows similar qualities in its presentation.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the green color and sliced appearance of the lime?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lime in Image B is presented in both a whole form, which is green, and a cut form with a typical sliced appearance, revealing its inner segments. These visual characteristics match how limes are commonly depicted when sliced. Comparing it with Image A, both images show a sliced lime beside the plate. Hence, the sliced lime's color and appearance are retained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chili powder is displayed in a small bowl with an orange-red hue and granular texture, consistent with the appearance of chili powder. Comparing with Image A, which shows similar color and texture details, confirms that these elements are retained in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in Image B includes a mango, lime, and chili powder arranged on a plate. The positions are similar to those in Image A: the mango is prominently placed at the center, the lime section is situated near the front, and the chili powder is in a small bowl. These objects maintain their relative positions between the two images.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plate exhibits a wooden texture with visible grains, which is a typical feature of such material. Comparing it with Image A, which also has a plate with wooden texture, confirms that this characteristic is retained in the edited image.",
