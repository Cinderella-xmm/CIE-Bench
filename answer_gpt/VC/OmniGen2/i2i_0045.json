      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, no girl is visible. The image is solely of a broad grassy field under a clear blue sky with no human figures present that might depict any act involving a frisbee. This absence contradicts the premise of a girl holding a frisbee.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict any individuals, so there is no summer outfit or any related entity visible in the image to evaluate its retention.",

      "question": "Does the new grass and sky background integrate seamlessly with the girl, platform, and frisbee without disrupting their appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grass and sky dominate the entire image, with no sign of a girl, platform, or frisbee to be seen. This means there is no integration of these elements with the background because the entities in question do not exist in the image.",
