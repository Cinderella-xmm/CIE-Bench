      "question": "Does the edited image retain the deep, blocky lug pattern of the tire treads?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which appears to depict a stylized vehicle, the tires have visible treads. However, upon close examination, the tread pattern is less pronounced and does not exhibit the deep, blocky lugs characteristic of the original, rugged tires in Image A. World knowledge about tire design suggests that the lug pattern is crucial for off-road traction, which is not as emphasized here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the embossed text \"ROCKS TIRE\" and \"SUPER SWAMPER\" visible on the sidewalls of the tires?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, which shows a futuristic, toy-like vehicle, does not include any visible embossed text on the tire sidewalls. Given the visual cues, it appears these tires are part of a stylized design, likely not meant to replicate the specific branding or model details found in Image A.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the five-spoke designs of the wheel hubs still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, I observe that the wheel hub design has changed significantly, featuring a more complex, turbine-like appearance rather than the simple five-spoke design seen in Image A, which is typical of standard tire wheels. This design reflects a creative, possibly non-functional aesthetic rather than retaining the original wheel design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the matte, rubber-textured surface of the tires maintained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts tires on a stylized vehicle that still appear to have a matte, rubbery texture. This suggests an attempt to maintain some realistic tire characteristics, as the matte texture is consistent with the typical appearance of rubber tires used for traction.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the tread blocks evenly spaced and proportionally consistent with the original tires?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, the tread blocks are visible but lack the consistency and even spacing seen in Image A. Image A shows traditional off-road tires where tread blocks are designed for maximum grip; Image B features a more simplified tread pattern, which might be more about aesthetics than function.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the edited image contain exactly four tires, corresponding to the original stack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vehicle is supported by less than four tires, as visibly evident by the single-tier design of a toy-like object. The basic structure and scale indicate that the four-tire setup, shown in Image A as a stack, does not translate to this vehicle depiction.",
