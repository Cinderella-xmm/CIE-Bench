    "Question": "Q1: Are the blue circular spots present on the serpent’s body, positioned as eyes or eye-like features?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the blue circular spots on the serpent's body are positioned in such a way that they resemble eyes or eye-like features. These spots are prominently displayed and are spaced out along the length of the serpent, reinforcing this appearance. Without needing to compare Image A, these visual cues suggest that the blue spots are intended to mimic eyes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the red and yellow colors form the primary scale patterns along the serpent’s body?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a serpent with bold and vivid coloring. The red and yellow hues are dominant and create the primary patterns along the serpent’s body. These colors are interwoven, forming distinct scale-like patterns. Evaluating Image B alone, it is clear that these two colors form the main visual components of the design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the black zigzag or spotted patterns visible as tribal markings on the serpent’s body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent's body is adorned with black patterns that resemble zigzags and spots, which could be interpreted as tribal-like markings. These markings provide contrast against the red and yellow background and add to the intricacy of the design. The presence of such patterns suggests a decorative or symbolic intent.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the segments of the serpent’s body shaped like spheres or near-spheres, reflecting the original bead form?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a serpent whose body is not segmented into spherical or near-spherical shapes. Instead, the serpent appears to have a continuous, sinuous form. This implies it does not reflect the original bead form of Image A, where beads would be more rounded and discrete.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the surface of the serpent retain a matte, slightly uneven texture resembling hand-painted craftsmanship?",
    "explanation": "The surface of the serpent in Image B looks smooth and glossy, as opposed to matte. The textures suggest a polished finish rather than a hand-painted or uneven surface, indicating a more digital or manufactured appearance. Therefore, it does not replicate the hand-crafted texture suggested by a matte, slightly uneven finish.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the colors red, yellow, blue, black, and white all present in the serpent’s body, maintaining the original palette?",
    "explanation": "Observing Image B, the serpent features red, yellow, blue, and black prominently. However, there is no visible white in the palette presented in this image. Although several colors match the original image, the absence of white indicates the palette isn’t fully maintained.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the patterns on the serpent’s body irregular and varied from segment to segment, matching the original bead diversity?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent's pattern is more uniform and repetitive rather than irregular and varied from segment to segment. This uniformity contrasts with the original bead diversity seen in Image A, where each bead may have distinct styles and appearances.",
    "answer": "No"
