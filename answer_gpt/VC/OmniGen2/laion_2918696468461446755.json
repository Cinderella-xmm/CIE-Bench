      "question": "Is the mechanical eyepatch with visible screws and metallic surface present on the central characterâ€™s right eye?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central character does not appear to have any visible eyewear accessories such as a mechanical eyepatch. The character seems to have a normal facial appearance without any specialized kit that would indicate a mechanical eyepatch. This assumption is based on the typical depiction of animated characters where mechanical elements are often pronounced for clarity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the central character holding an open book in both hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central character is holding a magnifying glass instead of an open book. The character has one hand prominently lifting the magnifying glass, which implies the action of examining or scrutinizing something, typical of detective representations.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there visible Chinese-style calligraphy on the cover of the book held by the central character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since the central character in Image B is not holding a book, there cannot be any visible Chinese-style calligraphy on an object that does not exist in this context. The character adopts accessories typical of detective imagery, not related to literary artifacts.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the central character have short, straight black hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central character in Image B is depicted with a hat on, typical of detective attire, and thus the hair is not directly visible. However, indications from the visible portions suggest short hair since hats typically fit closely on short hair for characters depicted as detectives.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there four distinct supporting characters visible in the background, including one with white hair, one with purple hair, one with blue hair, and one with dark hair and red eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several characters are visible in the background but their distinct hair colors are not recognizable due to the blurred/head options, and it appears there are three distinct shadowy figures that align with the understated environment common with detective themes rather than vibrant hair colors.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the central character have a calm, neutral facial expression with a slightly downward gaze?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central character in Image B is depicted in a manner typical of detectives, with a hat and suit, holding a magnifying glass, and ready to investigate. There isn't enough detail on facial expressions visible in the image due to the editing, making it impossible to definitively conclude their expression or gaze direction.",
