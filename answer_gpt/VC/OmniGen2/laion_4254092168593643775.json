    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the number \"7\" clearly visible on both the front fender and side panel of the motorcycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle is depicted in silhouette style, which abstracts and simplifies details. Thus, it does not display specific details such as numbers on the motorcycle. In contrast, Image A features the number '7' on the motorcycle visibly, but this characteristic is absent in Image B. Through common design approaches, a silhouette prioritizes form over fine details, explaining the absence of the '7' in this context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the track outline labeled \"5/5\" present in the upper-right corner of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the track outline labeled '5/5' is visible in the upper-right corner. This type of overlay graphic fits common elements often included to convey tracking or progress in media related to racing or sports. Verification against Image A shows this element consistent between both images, reaffirming its presence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the dust trail originate directly from the rear wheel of the motorcycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the motorcycle in silhouette form without detailed interactions like dust formation specifically around the rear wheel. Instead, dust appears as a stylized graphical effect in the design. Image A clearly shows the dust emanating from the rear wheel realistically, while Image B abstracts this detail for visual style rather than realism.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the rider depicted in a forward-leaning posture with hands gripping the handlebars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette of the rider suggests a general riding posture, but lacks detailed articulation like forward-leaning or grip specifics due to the simplified silhouette style, which does not show the detailed rider posture seen in Image A. Common understanding of silhouette art informs that such posture details are not visible.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the front wheel circular with a blue rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The front wheel in Image B is shown as a simplified circle without color details like a blue rim due to the silhouette style. Image A, however, displays a front wheel with the distinct feature of a blue rim, which is lost in the transition to silhouette in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the rider positioned in the foreground with the desert landscape behind them and the track outline in the upper-right corner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B places the silhouetted rider in the foreground, with stylized desert-like colors in the background and the track outline present in the upper-right corner. This composition aligns with the setup and spatial arrangement seen in a non-silhouette depiction like Image A, which shares similar elements, maintaining the foreground rider and background landscape setup.",
