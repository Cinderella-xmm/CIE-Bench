      "question": "Is the fallen log still present in the foreground, lying diagonally across the cave floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is transformed into a mystical setting, featuring a glowing circular portal with blue crystals and a bright light emanating from its center. There is no indication of a fallen log present in the foreground. By contrast, Image A clearly shows a rocky cave interior with a visible fallen log lying diagonally across the floor. There is a significant contrast in the nature of the images, making it clear that the log is not present in Image B.",

      "question": "Does sunlight still enter from the arch opening and illuminate the right side of the cave interior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on a magical portal emanating light, surrounded by blue crystals. There is no representation of sunlight entering or illuminating any such natural cave structures, as the environment presented is otherworldly and enclosed by the constructed portal instead of an open arch. Image A displays sunlight streaming into the cave. The absence of sunlight effects and a cave structure in Image B leads to the conclusion that this isn't happening.",

      "question": "Is the rocky, uneven ground surface visible beneath the arch and extending toward the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a fantasy setting with a smooth stone path leading to the portal entrance, which does not resemble the natural, rocky, and uneven cave floor seen in Image A. Instead, Image A clearly shows an irregular ground surface with natural rock formations extending toward the entry point. The stark difference in texture and composition indicates that the rocky ground is not visible in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the bright sky and distant tree-covered hillside still visible through the arch opening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B centers around a mystical portal without an open arch showing the sky or landscape beyond; instead, it features a glowing light source against a backdrop of darkness, enclosed by rock and crystals. In Image A, the arch opens to a bright sky and distant greenery. The clear thematic shift from a natural to a fantastical scene suggests that the sky and hills are not visible in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the cave interior structured with converging rock walls and a clear path leading toward the arch opening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a scene dominated by an illuminated portal within a constructed ring of rocks and crystals, lacking natural cave formations. Image A shows a typical cave structure with walls converging at an arched exit. The dramatic change from a natural to an artificial construct in Image B indicates that the cave-like structure is absent.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the surrounding rock walls still composed of layered sedimentary rock with natural weathering patterns and beige-to-brown coloration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rock walls have been replaced by a creatively structured magical portal, with a surface that appears smooth and supports crystalline formations rather than showing any evidence of natural geological layering or weathering. The Image A cave walls display typical sedimentary patterns and coloration, highlighting a natural setting absent in the fantastical depiction of Image B.",
