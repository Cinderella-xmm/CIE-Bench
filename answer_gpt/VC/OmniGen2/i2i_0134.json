      "question": "Is there visible steam rising from the broccoli/tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the environment is a forested area, and the broccoli does not exhibit any steam above it. This indicates that the broccoli/tree in the edited image does not show signs of being hot or cooked, which would typically produce steam. Visual cues such as the absence of wispy white vapor in or around the broccoli/tree confirm this. Thus, combining visual observation with the understanding of how steam would appear, steam is not visible.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the broccoli/tree rest on a white plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the broccoli/tree is placed on a plate that appears white. This is evident from the stark white color that contrasts the green surroundings of the forest and the green broccoli/tree itself. White plates are common and universally recognized, helping confirm the plate's color based on its luminance and contrast relative to the environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the broccoli/tree primarily green in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The broccoli/tree in Image B displays a rich green color that dominates its appearance, especially in the florets. Broccoli is commonly known to be green, and the edited image reflects this common color characteristic accurately. The environment also enhances the perception of the green color commonly associated with healthy and fresh vegetables.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the characteristic florets of the broccoli discernible on the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited depiction of the broccoli/tree features small, dense clusters, which are identifiable as broccoli florets. The texture, size, and distribution resemble the typical appearance of broccoli florets, making them discernible. Common knowledge regarding broccoli structure aids in recognizing these details even when presented as a tree.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the broccoli/tree have a defined stem-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The broccoli/tree in Image B clearly exhibits a distinct stem-like structure. This is evident as the part underneath the broccoli florets resembles the stalk or stem that typically supports broccoli, extending downward to the white plate. Visual cues from the image align with the general shape and form of broccoli stems as understood from world knowledge.",
