    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the elevated rocky outcrop forming the base of the island still present with its original silhouette and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the island is no longer an elevated rocky outcrop. Instead, it is depicted as a floating island with grass and lush vegetation beneath it. The original rocky silhouette and its position on water have been replaced with an imaginative floating concept.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the houses arranged in a dense, tiered cluster ascending the slope of the island?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the houses are still arranged somewhat densely, but the arrangement is part of a fairy tale-like castle setting on a floating island. The formation is less naturally tiered as in traditional urban planning and more whimsically integrated into a fantastical setting.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a visible road that connects the dock to the main cluster of houses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the concept of roads is replaced by bridges that connect parts of the floating island, and no traditional roads are connecting docks since the whole setting is elevated with no conventional dock seen.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a wooden dock structure extending from the island into the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, since the island is floating in mid-air, there is no water body immediately surrounding the island to extend a dock into. The environment does not support a typical dock structure as seen in a waterfront setting.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there trees visible in the foreground on both the left and right sides of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground includes large mushroom structures and other fantastical elements rather than conventional trees, which deviates from a natural forest setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there large mountain peaks visible in the background behind the island?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no large mountain peaks in the background. Instead, the background consists of a bright, clear sky with clouds, enhancing the floating fantasy setting of the image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the sunlight come from the upper left, casting shadows toward the lower right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting indicates a generally lit scene with sunlight seemingly coming from above, casting shadows in multiple directions typical of a bright and surreal fairytale setting. The sunlight is not distinctly from the upper left casting uniform shadows.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Do the buildings have red-tiled roofs and wooden walls with earthy tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings prominently feature red-tiled roofs consistent with a whimsical castle theme. The walls do not have a distinctly wooden appearance. Instead, they contribute to a fairytale aesthetic, using lighter, more fantastical tones.",
