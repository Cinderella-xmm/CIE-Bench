      "question": "Is the bird depicted with bright yellow feathers and an orange beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a bird is sitting prominently with vivid yellow feathers which are bright and striking against the softer background. Its beak is distinctly orange, a typical feature for many birds. The visual information provided in the image clearly shows these traits. The bird's colorful features are crisp and notable, highlighting its vivid appearance.",

      "question": "Does the bird have black eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bird in Image B shows clear black eyes, which stand out due to their contrast against the bright yellow feathers. Black eyes are common for birds and help them perceive their environment efficiently. In the image, the eyes are distinctly dark and enhance the expression of the bird.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the bird perched on a thin branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is visibly perched on a branch that appears relatively thin in proportion to the bird. This is a natural position for birds, as they commonly sit on branches that can support their weight. The image effectively captures the bird's balance and posture on the slim branch.",

      "question": "Does the background have a natural setting with green hues and a bokeh effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B displays a pleasing bokeh effect, with soft, out-of-focus elements. The hues in the background are primarily green, indicative of a natural setting such as a garden or forest. This blurring effect highlights the subject—the bright yellow bird—making it stand out more against the soft, greenish backdrops.",

      "question": "Are the bird's feet visibly gripping the branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's feet are clearly seen gripping the branch. The claws are naturally curved around the branch, suggesting stability and firmness in maintaining its position. This is characteristic of how birds perch, using their feet to secure themselves.",
