      "question": "Is the red circular insignia still present on the left lapel of the suit jacket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit jacket features a decorative element resembling an insignia or badge on the left lapel. However, the insignia is not red; instead, it features different colors including yellow and red. Observations from the visuals combined with knowledge about common suit decor lead to this conclusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the ear clearly visible on the left side of the head in its original anatomical position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ear appears to be a stylized element that is part of a cartoonish design, consistent with the overall animated style of the image. It is located where one would anatomically expect an ear, thus matching the position it should be.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible mouth depicted due to the edit of stylization, which omits giving facial details including a smile or teeth.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the nose retaining its original shape with a distinct bridge and rounded tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A stylized approach in Image B means the nose is not visible, as expected in a cartoonish representation. As such, it does not display the original anatomical features.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the head in a frontal view, not turned to the side. The symmetry and the way the features are aligned suggest a front-facing position.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a solid blue with no textures or objects, distinct from the off-white background of Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Shadow depiction is not prominent in Image B, the lighting appears even, typical for stylized digital illustrations with a flat look irrespective of realistic shadows.",

      "explanation": "Image B shows a collar that is neatly incorporated into the suit design, implying alignment and connection, although stylized rather than realistic.",
