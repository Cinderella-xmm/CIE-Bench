      "question": "Does the clock tower retain its hexagonal shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock tower displays six distinct sides, visible through the angles and positioning of the elements along the tower's structure. A hexagonal shape is characterized by having six edges and six vertices. By observing the architectural lines at the rooftop and the lower structure with the clock face, these elements confirm the hexagonal design. Combining world knowledge about geometric shapes and architectural designs, such structures like clock towers often utilize hexagonal shapes for aesthetic and structural purposes.",

      "question": "Is the clock face still present with Roman numerals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, there is a clock face prominently displayed on the tower, noted by its circular design. It features Roman numerals, observable from the distinct typography and arrangement around the clock face, which are typically identified as Roman numerals from I to XII. The presence of these numerals indicates the continued use of traditional designs for clock faces in towers, adding a classic visual touch.",

      "question": "Does the tower still have a balcony with balusters below the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a balcony directly below the clock face. Observing the architectural details, we see balusters aligned horizontally on the balcony's edge. Balusters are small columns that form the railing of a balcony, and they are clear in Image B, serving both a decorative and functional purpose in supporting the balcony structure.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the tower retain its pointed roof structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a rooftop above the hexagonal structure that maintains a pointed design, visible from its sloping sides leading to an apex at the top. Pointed roofs are typical in many clock towers to provide an elevated geometric element that defines the tower's silhouette and aids in water runoff. World knowledge and common architectural understanding validate the description of the roof as pointed given the triangular and converging lines.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the tower retain its green and yellow color scheme, excluding the flags?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the tower is predominantly colored in shades of green and yellow, excluding changes to the flags. The color application across the structure's different parts, such as the walls and roof, aligns with traditional color schemes used in such structures to denote vibrancy and visibility. The use of these colors underlines continuity with its original theme, considering common practices in utilizing bright colors for aesthetic appeal.",
