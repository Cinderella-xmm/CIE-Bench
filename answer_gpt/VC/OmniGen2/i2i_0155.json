      "question": "Are the plant's large, vibrant green leaves with their natural shape and arrangement retained in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves of the plant are large and vibrant green, which resembles their appearance in Image A. Their natural shape and arrangement remain consistent, maintaining the integrity of the plant's original characteristics. This conclusion is drawn from comparing the leaf size and color, which are strikingly similar in both images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the plant still positioned on the windowsill in the same manner as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plant is not positioned on the windowsill as it features a plain white background without any indication of a windowsill presence. The original position in Image A, where the plant clearly sits on a windowsill, contrasts with the edited image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the terracotta pot and saucer beneath the plant intact and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the terracotta pot and the saucer are indeed visible and appear unchanged in terms of color and shape. This can be determined by comparing the consistent color and form of the pot between the two images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks the presence of soft sunlight and its interaction with the plant or windowsill as seen in Image A. The white background in Image B omits any natural lighting effect, which is evident in the original image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include the blurred greenery visible through the window that appears in Image A. The edited image has been altered to feature a plain background with text, removing any background details like the greenery seen through the window in the original image.",
