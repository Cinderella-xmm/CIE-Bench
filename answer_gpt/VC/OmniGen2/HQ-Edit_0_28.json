      "question": "Is the red-and-white checkered keffiyeh still present on the man’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is depicted wearing a red-and-white checkered keffiyeh, which is a traditional Middle Eastern headscarf known as a ghutra or shemagh. This is visually consistent with the headwear in Image A. The checkered pattern remains visible and unchanged in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a monocle positioned over the man’s right eye?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When observing Image B, there is no indication of a monocle positioned over the man’s eye. Monocles are typically small, circular lenses used for vision correction and would be placed directly on the eye, which is not visible here. Thus, he is not depicted wearing a monocle.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the man holding an open newspaper with both hands and looking at it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is holding an open book with both hands rather than a newspaper. In Image A, a newspaper is clearly visible. Image B instead shows the man reading the book without any newspaper present.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there Arabic script visible in the top-right corner of the newspaper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain a newspaper; instead, the man is holding a book. As such, there cannot be Arabic script or any other script visible in the corner of a newspaper that does not exist in the image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there three open books on the desk: one on the left, one on the right, and one in front of the newspaper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is entirely different from Image A. Instead of a desk with open books, Image B features the man standing with a book in front of a decorated background that resembles a book cover. Consequently, there are no open books on a desk visible in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the man seated at a dark wooden desk with visible legs and surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the man standing rather than seated, with no desk visible in the composition. This is in contrast to Image A, where the man is sitting at a desk. Thus, the presence of a dark wooden desk in Image B is not applicable.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is a patterned Persian-style rug visible beneath the desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is not shown at a desk, and there is no visibility of a rug. The setting is entirely different from Image A, lacking any elements that would suggest the presence of a Persian-style rug.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is there a window on the left side of the image allowing daylight to enter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the man against a background resembling a book cover, and there is no window visible in the scene. Therefore, there cannot be a window allowing daylight to enter as seen in Image A.",
