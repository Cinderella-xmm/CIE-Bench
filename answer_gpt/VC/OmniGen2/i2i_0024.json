      "question": "Does the tennis player retain the pose with her right arm holding the racket and her left arm raised in a fist pump?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted as a chibi-style cartoon. The visual cues show a stylized representation of a tennis player with a racket. The position of the arms and body posture does not specifically suggest a fist pump as the hand is pointing upwards. This differs from Image A, where the player holds a racket in the right hand and raises the left arm in a fist pump, indicating an action related to tennis, signifying success or excitement.",

      "question": "Are the clay court lines present with a white outline to define the boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the illustration of a clay court is present, it is depicted as a simple red rectangle without distinct boundary lines. In contrast, Image A features a real tennis court with clear white boundary lines, typical of actual tennis court markings. The simplified representation in Image B omits these realistic details.",

      "question": "Does the tennis player wear an orange dress and a white visor, preserving their basic shapes and colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's chibi character wears a red dress and a white visor. The basic concept of a dress and visor is retained, but the color is distinctly a stylized red rather than the orange seen in Image A. This indicates a change in color representation, although the overall items of clothing (dress and visor) remain consistent.",

      "question": "Is the tennis racket represented as a black-filled shape with minimal detailing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the tennis racket is highly stylized with minimal detail. It is shown as a simple shape with a black outline, and lacks intricate detailing. This differs starkly from Image A's more realistic depiction of a tennis racket, which includes visible strings and form, indicating a reduction in detail in the cartoon representation.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the player exhibit a tennis-related gesture (specifically, the fist pump)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character makes a gesture with the index finger pointing upwards rather than a closed fist. This varies from Image A, where the player performs a fist pump with a raised left arm, a gesture commonly associated with tennis or sports in general. Thus, the specific gesture of a fist pump is not represented in Image B.",
