      "question": "Is the clock face present on the upper section of the left bell tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left bell tower of the miniature model doesn't have any clock face visible. In such models, details are typically simplified or omitted, compared to their real-world counterparts. Image A depicts the actual cathedral, which shows a clock on the upper section of the left tower. However, the edited image does not exhibit this detail.",

      "question": "Are there two bells visible in the arches of the right bell tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the model based on a church or cathedral style tends to not have real, functional bells visible due to scale and design limitations. The arches of the right bell tower do not show any bells. In contrast, Image A, which is a real-world depiction, shows multiple bells in the right tower. However, the edited image lacks this detail.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a circular stained-glass window with a floral or star-like pattern centered above the main entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the model's facade has architectural features like windows, but there's no presence of a detailed stained-glass window above the main entrance. Typically, these models only mimic the shape without intricate design work. Image A does show such a window distinctively. The edited image, however, does not have this detail.",

      "question": "Is there a cross positioned at the highest point of the central roofline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the top of the central roofline, there's no cross present in this model. Models may omit certain small elements for simplicity. In Image A, the cross is visible atop the central roofline, confirming its presence in the real cathedral. The edited image lacks this feature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there three doors on the façade: one large central door and two smaller side doors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, the model, does present a large central door and two smaller side doors, in line with common architectural designs of cathedrals or churches. This detail attempts to replicate real architecture, which is also evident in Image A, where the cathedral displays this door arrangement.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the model's facade is symmetrically divided by vertical columns and pilasters. This is a typical feature in both models and real-world architecture like cathedrals. This symmetry is also visible in the real cathedral in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the model does not feature the complex colorations of real structures; instead, the left bell tower appears uniform and lacks the pinkish dome with a cross. Image A shows such a feature on the left bell tower of the cathedral. This detail is absent in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, being a model, the surrounding context is usually minimal, focusing only on the main structure. There is no depiction of a multi-story building with balconies and railings to the right of the cathedral. In Image A, such a building is visible next to the cathedral. The edited image lacks this additional structure.",
