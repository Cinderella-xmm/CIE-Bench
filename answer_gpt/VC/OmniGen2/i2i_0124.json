      "question": "Does the image retain the cylindrical, elongated shape of the baseball bats?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two objects resembling baseball bats retain an elongated, cylindrical shape that is characteristic of baseball bats. This is evident from the visual cues of the objects, where they are drawn with rounded ends and lengthwise proportionality that signifies the recognizable form of a bat. This understanding can be drawn from general knowledge of how baseball bats typically look.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the black taped handles of the bats still distinctly visible against the wooden shafts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handles are depicted with a noticeable dark color against the lighter wooden shafts of the bats. Although the handles are stylized, they maintain a strong contrast, showcasing a distinct division between the handle and the bat itself. This is consistent with the typical appearance of baseball bats where the handle is often wrapped or painted differently.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the two baseball bats remain parallel to each other in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the two cylindrical bat-like objects maintains their parallel alignment. This can be inferred from the consistent spacing between them and their matching orientation aligned side by side. Understanding parallel alignment from typical arrangements of similar objects helps confirm this view.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the bats still placed on a grassy surface, indicating an outdoor setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly illustrates the bats placed on a bed of stylized grass, reinforcing the setting as being outdoors. The background and base feature greenery which signifies grass, aligning with the typical outdoors scenery expected for items like baseball bats.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bats maintain their slight angle toward the viewer, preserving perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bats appear to hold a perspective that implies they are angled slightly towards the viewer, as suggested by the narrowing of the width as they extend from bottom to top. This perspective portrayal is consistent with how objects are typically drawn to suggest depth and orientation in a scene.",
