      "question": "Does the edited image retain the intricate wrought-iron lattice structure of both Eiffel Towers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows two Eiffel Tower structures enclosed in a snow globe. Both towers maintain the characteristic lattice design recognized worldwide as typical of the Eiffel Tower. The visual depiction shows a consistent intricate pattern of interlocking metal beams, which is a signature of the Eiffel Tower's construction. By combining this imagery with world knowledge of the Eiffel Towerâ€™s design, it is clear that the intricate wrought-iron lattice structure is well preserved.",

      "question": "Are both towers supported by a triangular base composed of four distinct pillars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, both towers have bases that conform to the classic design of the Eiffel Tower, consisting of curved arches meeting at the ground, typically supported by pillars on each corner. However, due to the perspective within the snow globe, not all support structures are distinctly visible, and not directly triangular. Therefore, despite potential artistic modifications, the standard design appears maintained without explicit triangular bases with four distinct pillars.",

      "question": "Is there a clearly defined archway beneath each tower through which the path passes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows clearly defined archways beneath each of the towers. These archways are characteristic elements of the Eiffel Tower's structure, allowing paths to pass directly beneath the towers. In world knowledge, the arches form a space for passage under the Eiffel Tower, and in this depiction, they retain this architectural function, visually confirmed by the path routing through them in the image.",

      "question": "Are there exactly two Eiffel Towers present in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image within the snow globe clearly portrays two distinct Eiffel Tower structures. This artistic representation of an unusual scenario with two towers, opposed to the known singular Eiffel Tower in reality, is evident from visual cues of two separate tower structures within the globe, confirming there are exactly two towers depicted.",

      "question": "Does each tower have a pointed spire at its apex?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, both Eiffel Towers have a pointed spire at the apex. This is consistent with the design of the real Eiffel Tower, which ends with a recognizable pointed pinnacle. Visual analysis combined with world knowledge confirms the presence of these pointed spires in both towers depicted inside the snow globe.",

      "question": "Are there three distinct horizontal platform levels visible along the height of each tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the towers feature just two visible horizontal platforms along their height. The standard Eiffel Tower has three distinct horizontal levels. The visual information in the depiction suggests only two horizontal platforms on each tower, which is inconsistent with the authentic three-level design according to world knowledge of the Eiffel Tower architecture.",
