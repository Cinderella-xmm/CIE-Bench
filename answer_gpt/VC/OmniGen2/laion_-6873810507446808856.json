      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there two vertically stacked pancake layers, with the bottom one slightly larger than the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual cues show a stack of pancakes that are personified with a face and a cape, forming a comical character. As this is a cartoon representation, the pancakes are shown as a single, stylized stack with no indication of differing size between layers. In a literal sense, there aren't two pancakes shown vertically stacked as described, so the cartoon does not imply a bottom larger than the top pancake. Given the cartoon nature, it is unlikely to have such detail. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the pancakes retain a dominant golden-yellow color throughout their visible surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire stack of pancakes is depicted as a cartoon character with a constant golden-yellow color across its surface until the syrup is applied, consistent with typical cartoon representations of pancakes. The dominant color appears uniform, likely intended to appear appetizing and consistent with pancake depiction. Thus, the answer is 'Yes'.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a solid, rectangular pat of pale yellow butter placed on the top pancake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a piece of butter on the top pancake. Instead, there is an animated butter square being used in a speech bubble as an object, but not positioned on the pancake itself. The pancakes in the second image are characterized cartoonishly without direct integration of a butter pat on top. Thus, the answer is 'No'.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible stream of amber-colored syrup flowing from a pitcher onto the pancakes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the syrup appears as a cartoon, visually represented by a happy face and hat-wearing pancake that references syrup as part of its dialogue in the comic strip style but does not visibly show syrup as a flowing substance. Unlike in realistic images, cartoon illustrations often simplify representations. Thus, the answer is 'No'.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the pancake stack placed on a white plate with a light blue rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the pancake character on a flat, plain surface, common in cartoon strips, where the environment is more consistently a symbolic rather than literal representation. There is no explicit depiction of a plate, white or with a blue rim. Therefore, considering typical cartoon style, the answer is 'No'.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the inner sides of the pancakes visibly porous and airy, showing a spongy texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pancake stack is represented by a smooth, cartoonish surface without detailing or texture that would suggest porosity or airiness. Cartoon imagery often lacks detailed texture for simplicity and stylization, focusing instead on facial expressions and comedic elements. Thus, the answer is 'No'.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the syrup stream originate from above the stack and flow downward onto the top pancake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the comic references syrup and includes visual elements of a mimicked syrup interaction, it does not physically show a syrup flow or pitcher pouring onto the pancakes. Instead, the visuals focus on an anthropomorphized syrup reference within comic panel dialogue, adhering to cartoon simplicity. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.",
