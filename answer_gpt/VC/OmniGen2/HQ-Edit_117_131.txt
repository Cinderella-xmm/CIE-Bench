    "Question": "Q1: Is the squirrel standing upright on its hind legs with its front paws clasped together near the chest?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character, Sammy the squirrel, is depicted standing upright on its hind limbs, consistent with an anthropomorphic design. The positioning of the front limbs suggests a readiness or openness, often seen in animated characters. Given this visual information combined with common knowledge of cartoon character designs, the presence of a pose that mimics standing with paws near the chest is inferred.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the squirrel have a large, bushy tail that curves upward and outward, extending above the back?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases a cartoon-like squirrel character with a stylized design, which includes a large, often exaggerated tail. While the specifics of it curving upward and outward are visually implied in many cartoon depictions, in Image B, the tail is quite prominent, a common trait in animated squirrels for visual impact.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the ears of the squirrel rounded and positioned on top of the head, with a visible pink inner surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ears of the cartoon character are indeed rounded, which is a typical stylization for animated animals to make them look cuter and more approachable. The visual cues in the image suggest their placement on top of the head, although cartoonish, are consistent with this description. Any coloration details, such as a pink inner surface, are less precise in cartoons but would be a common depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the eyes large, round, dark, and located symmetrically on either side of the face, with visible pupils?",
    "explanation": "For Image B, the large round eyes are a characteristic feature of animated characters meant to emphasize expressiveness. They appear symmetrically positioned above the snout, fitting the common depiction of animated animals or characters with noticeable pupils. This symmetry and design enhance the character's appeal.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the head proportionally smaller than the body, with the tail approximately equal in length to the body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon character does not strictly adhere to realistic proportions. Often in animation, the head is exaggerated for expressiveness and is usually larger relative to the body than seen in real animals. The description of the head being smaller is inconsistent with the character design seen here, nor is the tail clearly depicted relative to body length in proportion.",
    "answer": "No"
