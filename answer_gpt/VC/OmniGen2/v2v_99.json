      "question": "Is the text \"RONALOO\" and the number \"7\" visible on the player's jersey?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the player's jersey features a small logo that doesn't align with common patterns like large printed text on the back. The design reflects more of a generic sports jersey style suited for a cartoonish depiction, where intricate details are minimized for a simplified representation. Hence, lettering like 'RONALOO' and the specific number '7', which are typical in realistic depictions, are not present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the player, depicted in a chibi-style cartoon representation, is positioned as if engaging in soccer play. The player has their leg extended near the ball which, paired with the playful and active stance, suggests the act of kicking is in progress. The kicking pose is iconic for action scenes involving soccer.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stadium setting where simplified illustrations of spectators are visible in the stands, along with bright overhead lights that are common in large sports venues. The design, while stylized, maintains elements such as crowd and lighting to capture the essence of a lively, dynamic stadium environment.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon-styled depiction focuses mainly on the chibi character and the ball; a goalkeeper figure dressed in green is not part of the scene presented. This simplified scenario highlights the primary character without additional elements like opposing players.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer ball is positioned close to the player's foot, suggesting potential movement, characteristic of a player about to make a shot. The ball's proximity to the player in an active stance hints at impending movement, typical in scenarios depicting soccer action. However, the exact depiction of motion direction is abstracted in this style, focusing more on static composition.",
