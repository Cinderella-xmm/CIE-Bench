      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smartphone is visibly a silver-colored device with rounded corners and a circular home button below the screen. This conclusion is drawn from the clearly visible design elements typical of earlier iPhone models recognizable due to the color and home button style. These features remain unchanged compared to Image A.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a laptop with a silver chassis, black keyboard, and a visible trackpad below the keyboard.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand in Image B is depicted with five fingers and visible fingernails, holding the phone naturally. This can be discerned through the clear visibility and positioning of all fingers around the device, an essential aspect of holding a phone. The depiction matches common anatomical expectations and holds consistent with what is generally seen in natural hand grips. There's no difference from how the hand appears in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show horizontal window blinds in the background; instead, the background is different, likely a digital or exterior cityscape setting accompanying the tech-themed design. This differs significantly from Image A where window blinds are explicitly visible, denoting a change in background scenery.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, blue is indeed present as the dominant color on both the screens. The digital interface is highlighted prominently in a blue color scheme across the devices, which signifies a technological theme. This contrasts with Image A where blue is used, but not as the sole dominant color across both devices.",
