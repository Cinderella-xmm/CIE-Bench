    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the mustache present and shaped in a way that matches the original image, with a curved, thick form extending from both sides of the upper lip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, since it is a doll, there is no visible mustache present below the blurred area. In Image A, based on world knowledge about Albert Einstein, it is likely that he features a thick, curved mustache extending from both sides of the upper lip, a characteristic facial feature. Comparison clearly shows the absence of a mustache in the doll form of Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the hair retain its wild, voluminous, and unevenly distributed white appearance, particularly with strands extending outward from the sides and top of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the doll's hair is styled to appear wild, voluminous, and unevenly distributed, resembling iconic representations of Albert Einstein's hair with long strands extending outward. This matches the white, unkempt appearance seen in Image A, capturing the iconic hairstyle known to Einstein.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there vertical black stripes running down the front of the sweater, matching the pattern seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sweater of the doll features horizontal black stripes rather than the absence of any black stripes on the clothing in Image A, which is a plain dark garment. The pattern differs significantly between the two images.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is a portion of a light-colored shirt collar visible beneath the sweater’s neckline, aligned with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the doll does not show any visible light-colored shirt collar beneath the sweater’s neckline. Image A similarly shows no visible light-colored shirt collar under the garment. As such, there is no light-colored collar to be compared in either image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the eyes, nose, and forehead lines maintain their original relative positions and shapes, such as the horizontal creases on the forehead and the oval shape of the eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial details are covered and cannot be compared in terms of creases and shapes. Image A, presumably showing Einstein, would be expected to have specific creases and eye shapes known from his portraits. As Image B provides no visual information on these details due to the blur, a comparison can't be reasonably made.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the sweater’s neckline and shoulder area textured with ribbed patterns consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sweater features clear ribbed patterns around the neckline and cuffs, providing a textured appearance. Image A, on the other hand, has a plain garment with no visible texturing in these areas. Thus, the patterns in Image B's sweater's neckline differ from the original image.",
