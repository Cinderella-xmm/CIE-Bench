    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the recognizable coastline shape of North and South America, including the Gulf of Mexico and the narrow isthmus of Central America?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the map no longer appears to depict the recognizable coastline of North and South America. Instead, it features a stylized map with decorative elements that resemble a fantasy or conceptual representation, rather than a realistic geographical map. Therefore, the recognizable features such as the Gulf of Mexico and the isthmus of Central America are not present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the latitude and longitude grid lines still visible or clearly implied in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the map does not prominently show latitude and longitude grid lines. Instead, it focuses more on decorative and thematic elements such as a ship's wheel and artistic compass, along with ornamental illustrations. This suggests that the usual map grid lines are not a dominant or visible feature in the edited image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the aged parchment texture, including stains and discoloration, preserved in the background of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) has a cleaner and more stylized appearance, missing the detailed textured quality that would resemble aged parchment. The background seems more polished and designed, lacking the stains and discoloration typically seen in aged parchment.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the original sepia, gold, and green tones preserved as the dominant color palette in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B does include gold tones in the depiction of the ship's wheel and compass, the sepia and green tones are not prominent. The overall palette is more vibrant with a focus on gold hues, lacking the original's subtle sepia and green blend that gave an antique feel.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are at least two of the original handwritten script labels or ship illustrations visibly present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is more on the decorative nautical theme rather than on traditional map elements like labels and ship illustrations. It centers around the ship's wheel and decorative lights, rather than the detailed historical illustrations seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the transformed compass (now a shipâ€™s wheel) retain the golden metallic finish and intricate engraved patterns seen in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the ship's wheel is depicted in a golden metallic finish, similar to the original compass. However, the intricate engraved patterns seen in the original might not be as detailed in the transformation into a ship's wheel, focusing more on the general form and design rather than engravings.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the map oriented such that North remains at the top of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a concept map which is more decorative than geographical, with no clear indicator of orientation such as a north arrow typical in geographic maps. Thus, the question of map orientation is not applicable as there is no clear north-south orientation present.",
