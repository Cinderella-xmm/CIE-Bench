      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the character is wearing a straw hat that is visually identifiable by its texture and color.

      "question": "Is the character wearing a red open-collared coat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted wearing a coat that is red and open-collared, which is consistent with character designs typical for adventurous or pirate-themed animations. The coat is visibly open at the collar, allowing a view of the character's upper chest area, aligning with this style.",

      "question": "Is there a yellow sash tied around the character's waist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the character does not appear to have a yellow sash tied around the waist. Instead, the visible feature is a yellow belt, suggesting a divergence from characters that might traditionally have a sash. This observation supports the conclusion that there is no sash present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the character wearing blue shorts; however, the trim at the bottom of these shorts is not furry, but plain, such as a smooth hem, which is a departure from the furry trim that denotes stylistic choices in similar character depictions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face is blurred, thus obscuring the character's expression, making it impossible to discern any specific features such as a cheerful expression, wide eyes, or an open-mouthed smile. These traits are typically visible when facial features are clear.",
