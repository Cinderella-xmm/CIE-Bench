      "question": "Is the winged \"B\" logo visible on the rear of the vehicle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object appears to be a yacht on crystal wheels rather than a vehicle in the traditional sense, breaking from conventional design. The yacht's design doesn't incorporate a traditional rear surface where a car logo would be located. Instead, the yacht features a sleek body with oceanic themes above the wheels. Given the unique design specific to yachts, it's unlikely there would be a winged 'B' logo typical of Bentley vehicles, which usually place logos prominently. Therefore, the visual and context cues suggest the winged 'B' logo isn't part of this edited image.",

      "question": "Is the \"BENTLEY GREENWICH\" text visible on the rear license plate area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a yacht with crystal wheels, an unconventional platform for the display of typical automotive features such as license plates and associated text. Yachts don't typically feature a license plate area with such text, as it is associated with vehicles. The appearance in Image B shows smooth, expansive panel areas dedicated to design and aesthetic elements rather than license-type text. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that \"BENTLEY GREENWICH\" text isn't visible.",

      "question": "Does the vehicle retain a silver metallic color as its primary surface tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a yacht design with a blend of white and blue tones, mimicking ocean waves. Silver metallic color, typical of traditional vehicles, isn't implemented as the primary tone here; instead, blue dominates the hull, and white is prevalent above, representing a maritime theme. The absence of a primary silver color and presence of predominant oceanic tones suggest the overall aesthetic intention. Hence, the primary surface tone isn't a silver metallic.",

      "question": "Is there a continuous chrome trim line visible along the lower side of the vehicle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the yacht design does not incorporate a typical chrome trim line that you would find along the lower side of a conventional vehicle such as a car. Yachts are designed differently, often focusing on hull form and not the trim details that cars feature for stylistic or aerodynamic purposes. Thus, based on visual analysis paired with common nautical design principles, a continuous chrome trim line isn't visible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the yacht rests on crystal-like wheels, sitting in isolation against a black background. Unlike the vehicle in Image A which is clearly on a circular black platform, the yacht doesn't appear to rest on any such platform, as the setup features a more digitally-rendered environment typical of concept design presentations. Without the indication of a surrounding platform, it's reasonable to conclude a circular black platform isn't present.",
