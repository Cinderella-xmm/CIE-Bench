    "Question": "Q1: Are the two tall towers positioned symmetrically on either side of the central section?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the two tall towers are indeed positioned symmetrically on either side of the central section. This is evident from the visual cue that both towers are of equal height and design, located at the left and right extremities of the central building, which is a common architectural feature for castles or fortress-like structures. World knowledge about symmetry in architecture confirms this observation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is there a centrally located arched doorway with a wooden door beneath a rounded arch?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a centrally located arched doorway; however, there is no wooden door beneath the rounded arch. The doorway is a clear open arch, which is evident from the lack of a door in the visual information. Typically, a wooden door would be visible as a separate element, but in this image, it is unfinished, and the focus is on its arch form.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Does a set of stone steps ascend from the water level directly to the arched entrance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a set of steps is visible that ascends directly to the arched entrance of the structure. These steps are made of wooden materials rather than stone, as indicated by their texture and appearance. By using world knowledge, the material is recognized as different, but their function as steps leading to the entrance is clear.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are there multiple rectangular windows with dark frames aligned vertically on each tower?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are multiple openings that could be mistaken for windows due to their vertical alignment on each tower. However, these openings are arched and do not have any frames, especially dark ones, as they resemble gaps rather than traditional windows. Common architectural elements such as frames and glass are absent, distinguishing these from conventional windows.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the tops of both towers feature flat surfaces with crenellated edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tops of both towers do feature flat surfaces with crenellated edges. This design is typical of castle fortifications, intended for defense, providing not only a flat observation area but also a battlement pattern characterized by its square notches, which is visible and aligns with historical architectural functions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q6: Is there a low stone wall extending horizontally from the right side of the castle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no indication of a low stone wall extending horizontally from the right side of the castle. The visual analysis shows that the right side ends with the structure itself, with no continuation of a wall past the main building, indicating a lack of such a feature.",
    "answer": "No"
