      "explanation": "In Image B, the handwritten notes and highlighted elements ('Birthday' on January 2, 'Wedding' on October 12, 'No work' on September 8, etc.) are still visible. This is determined by visually identifying the same colored circles and handwritten words in both the original and edited images. Since the colors and handwriting styles match, it is confirmed that these notes are indeed still present.",
