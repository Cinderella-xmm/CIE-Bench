      "question": "Is the trunk of each elephant still curved upward in the same manner as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephants' trunks are still visually observable to be curved upward at the tip. This is a common aesthetic design choice for elephant figurines, often symbolizing good luck or a joyful pose. In Image A, the trunks of both elephants are also visibly curved upward in a similar manner. Comparing this attribute between Image A and Image B, both maintain the upward curve of the trunk, signifying that this detail has been preserved in the editing process.",

      "question": "Are the ears of both elephants still present in their original flared shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both elephants have ears that are flared outward from the head, a typical characteristic of elephant sculptures. This positioning gives them a recognizable and aesthetic elephant look. In Image A, the ears of both elephants are also displayed in a flared position, suggesting movement or alertness. By comparing, it's evident that Image B retains the original shape and positioning of the ears observed in Image A.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a decorative, oval-shaped pattern on the backs of both elephants, bordered with a golden outline, mimicking a mosaic appearance. In Image A, a similar mosaic pattern with golden trim can be seen on each elephant's back. Comparing the two, the core design element of an oval-shaped mosaic pattern bordered by gold trim remains consistent between both images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephants clearly have tusks that are gold in color, positioned near their mouths. This is a common embellishment in depicting elephants to add elegance and luxury. Similarly, in Image A, both elephants display tusks with a golden hue situated by their mouths. Comparing both images, the tusks' position and color are consistently maintained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show a decorative band with a scrollwork pattern around the lower bodies of the elephants. In Image A, such a band can be visibly identified, encircling the base of each figurine with intricate scrollwork. The absence of this specific detail in Image B indicates that this decorative element was removed during the editing process.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes are positioned on the sides of the elephants' heads and are rendered in a dark color, which is conventional for elephant sculptures to replicate their natural appearance. Image A similarly presents the elephants with dark-colored eyes placed on the sides of their heads. Thus, this detail is consistently preserved across both images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the larger elephant is seen on the left side while the smaller one is on the right. This positioning mirrors Image A, where the elephants are arranged in the same relative positions and sizes. Maintaining the same layout in both images helps preserve the visual hierarchy and balance of the artistic presentation.",
