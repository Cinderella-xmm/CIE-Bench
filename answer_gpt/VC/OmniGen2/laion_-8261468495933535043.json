    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the two elongated sausage-shaped forms positioned on the left side of the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we can see two elongated forms that resemble sausages, positioned on the left side of a gray plate. This is a common arrangement for placing sausages on a dinner plate. The orientation and placement are consistent with how food items like sausages are typically presented.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a circular form with a central orange-yellow disc representing the egg yolk located in the lower right quadrant of the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two circular forms with central orange-yellow discs, resembling fried eggs, located predominantly in the lower right quadrant of the plate. This placement and visual resemblance to eggs with yolk are quite clear and typical for representing fried eggs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a cluster of green and red elements in the upper right portion of the plate representing the salad?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual elements in the upper right portion do not consist of green and red components that represent a realistic salad. Instead, they appear like stylized or artistic leaf shapes and do not convey the typical natural variation found in actual salad ingredients.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the meal arranged on a circular gray plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire set of visual forms is indeed placed on what appears to be a circular plate with a gray color, which matches the typical appearance of a dining plate being circular.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sausages on the left, the egg in the lower right, and the salad in the upper right of the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sausage-like forms are on the left, and the egg-like forms are in the lower right. However, the upper right does not have a realistic salad; instead, it has stylized leaf forms, which do not meet the criteria for being identified as a salad in the usual sense.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there distinct red circular elements interspersed among the green elements in the salad cluster?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual elements identified as leaf motifs do not contain distinct red circular elements interspersed among them. Therefore, this does not match the description of having red elements among green as you would find in a real salad.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there thin green linear elements (rosemary) placed along the sausages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the sausage-like forms is uniformly styled without the thin green linear elements that are typical of rosemary on actual sausages, which were evident in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
