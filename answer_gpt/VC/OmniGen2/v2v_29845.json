      "question": "Are the long, upward-curving horns of the cow present and retaining their original shape and position on the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horns are indeed present as the cow's original feature, curving upward in the same traditional manner as seen in Image A. The placement on the head aligns with their natural position. This conclusion draws from direct observation of the cow's horns and understanding of typical cow anatomy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the reddish-brown shaggy fur covering the body of the hybrid figure, particularly on the head and shoulders, present and consistent with the original cow’s appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fur appears smoother and not quite as shaggy as in Image A. The edited image showcases a more stylized, less realistic depiction which diverges from the original cow's shaggy fur appearance. This is determined by comparing the textures and styles portrayed in both images.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the white lab coat visible on the upper body of the hybrid figure, including the lapels, pockets, and full length down to the waist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a white lab coat similar to Image A, with identifiable parts like the lapels and pockets visible across the upper body extending to the waist. These elements are part of standard lab coat designs, which are discernible upon observing the clothing in both images.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the dark-colored tie visible beneath the collar of the lab coat on the hybrid figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dark-colored tie is evident beneath the collar of the lab coat in Image B, as it logically complements the outfit by adding formality, matching the appearance seen in Image A. It is visually recognizable as a typical feature in professional attire.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the brown trousers and black dress shoes present on the lower half of the hybrid figure, with the right leg slightly raised in a walking motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, brown trousers and black dress shoes are visible on the lower half of the figure, similar to Image A. However, the right leg is not raised like in the original walking motion. This analysis involves checking the positioning and style of the attire and comparing the movements depicted.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the hybrid figure exhibit a forward walking posture with the right leg lifted off the ground, mimicking the original man’s stride?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not quite depict the same walking motion. The right leg is not lifted off the ground in a similar stride, differing from the posture seen in Image A which portrayed movement. This inference draws from observing the body posture and leg positioning.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
