      "question": "Is the curved carriage of the typewriter present and accurately shaped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the typewriter features a curved carriage on top, which aligns with the typical design of vintage typewriters where the carriage serves to hold and move the paper through the typing mechanism. The shape seems consistent with common historical typewriter designs, where the carriage curves to support efficient paper movement. This curvature is visually distinguishable and fits the functional design of a typewriter. By correlating the observed image with known typewriter structures, one can conclude that the carriage is indeed present and accurately shaped.",

      "question": "Are the round silver key caps arranged in a QWERTY layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, the typewriter's key caps appear to be round and silver, a typical style for older typewriters. However, it's challenging to conclusively determine the QWERTY layout from this image as the clarity and visibility of individual labels on the keys are insufficient. World knowledge dictates that older typewriters commonly feature QWERTY layouts, yet without distinct labeling visible from this image, accurately assessing the layout is not feasible.",

      "question": "Is the brand name \"Underwood\" visible on the front panel of the typewriter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the typewriter's front panel shows no brand name. The absence of any textual branding visibility on this surface indicates that the brand name 'Underwood' is not present here. Typewriters commonly feature their brand names prominently for identification, but in this instance, no such label is visible when examining the image.",

      "question": "Is the radial fan-like pattern beneath the carriage present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The radial fan-like pattern, which helps protect the mechanism and often exists beneath the carriage on traditional typewriters, is not observable in Image B. The visible area beneath the carriage lacks this pattern, which could have been marked by distinct grooved radiating lines often forming such designs. Based on the visual input, this pattern typically found on older typewriters is not depicted here.",

      "question": "Are the side knobs and left lever present on the typewriter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows both the side knobs and a lever, features commonly found in traditional typewriters to help adjust the carriage and paper positioning. These elements are located appropriately on the typewriter, noticeably on its side, as expected for operational interaction in paper typing mechanisms. Observation coupled with common typewriter knowledge indicates these components are indeed present.",

      "question": "Is the typewriter body predominantly glossy black?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals that the typewriter features a glossy green body, deviating from the glossy black typically associated with vintage typewriters. The green coloration is dominant in the typewriterâ€™s construction, providing a visual variation that contrasts with the usual monochrome designs employed in traditional models. Knowledge of similar historical designs combined with the current observation asserts that the body is not predominantly glossy black.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Traditionally, the platen roller is a crucial component within the carriage and visible above the keyboard where paper aligns for typing. In Image B, the roller appears where expected, above the row of keys, affirming its presence as part of the functional typewriter elements. Visual inspection reflects typical typewriter structural characteristics, confirming the roller's visibility in this setting.",
