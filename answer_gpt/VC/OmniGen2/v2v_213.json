      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly shows black spots and white markings on its wings. There are prominent black and white areas along the edges of the wings, similar in position to markings seen on butterflies. These markings are visually clear and distinguishable. These features resemble general butterfly markings often used in art and design. Image A displays a similar arrangement; therefore, the edited image retains these features.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the fuzzy texture of the butterfly's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the butterfly's body as having a smooth and cartoon-like texture with no visible fuzziness or detailed surface texture. Typically, butterfly bodies are somewhat furry or hairy. Image A, however, shows the butterfly with a distinctly fuzzy texture that is realistic. Thus, the edited image does not retain the fuzzy texture.",

      "question": "Is the butterfly still positioned on the wooden surface in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the butterfly positioned on what appears to be a wooden surface, as indicated by the plank lines and brown hues typical of wooden textures. The table-like structure is consistent with furniture designs. Image A also shows a similar setup, confirming that the butterfly remains on a wooden surface.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's wings appear flat and cartoonish, lacking intricate details. The color gradients are smooth without the delicate patterns usually seen in real butterfly wings. Image A provides a sharp and detailed texture displaying veins and patterned scales on the wings, common in nature. Therefore, the edited image does not retain the detailed texture.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the specific arrangement of spots on the butterfly's wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a different arrangement of spots, which are uniform and stylized. The dots are less varied and more symmetrically placed, typical of animated or stylized representations rather than realistic ones. Image A displays a broader range of spot sizes with more complex and natural arrangements. Therefore, the edited image does not retain the exact arrangement.",
