    "Question": "Q1: Are the eyes green in color?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features are blurred, and specifics like eye color aren't discernible. Given that no visual detail about the eyes can be determined in the edited image, the answer is based purely on the visible content within Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the lipstick applied in a rich red shade?",
    "explanation": "The facial features, including the lips, are obscured in Image B. Therefore, observing the lipstick color directly is not feasible. The answer is deduced based on the image content.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the subject looking upward and toward the upper left of the frame?",
    "explanation": "Since the facial features and direction are not identifiable due to the blur in Image B, it's unclear where the subject is facing. The answer is determined by the visible content of Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the left shoulder bare and visible in the foreground?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain figures have visually distinct shapes and attire, but specific identification of left and right shoulders is not feasible due to their cartoonish representation. Hence, the content of the image does not clarify if the left shoulder is bare.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a pinkish, textured material partially visible near the lower left edge of the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, cartoon-like figures have bright, solid colors with defined contours, without any textured materials partially visible near the lower left edge of the image. Based on the general perception and analysis of Image B, which lacks visible textures on the edges, the answer is deduced.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there soft highlights on the cheekbones and jawline created by directional lighting?",
    "explanation": "The cartoon nature of Image B implies that lighting effects such as soft highlights on cheekbones and jawline aren't present as these features are blurred and simplified. Thus, based on the simplified visual representation, the answer is provided.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the facial features symmetrically aligned with balanced spacing between the eyes, nose, and mouth?",
    "explanation": "Image B represents keychain figures with blurred facial features where symmetry and spacing cannot be articulated due to the lack of clear facial details. Based on these observations, the answer is determined.",
    "answer": "No"
