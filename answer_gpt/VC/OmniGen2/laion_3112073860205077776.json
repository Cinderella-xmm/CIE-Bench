      "question": "Is the golden-brown crust of the pie slice present with visible crumbly texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual depiction is a stylized illustration rather than a photo. The pie depicted is cartoonish with exaggerated features, such as bright colors and smooth surfaces that do not represent a realistic crumbly texture typical of a pie crust. The cartoon version lacks the intricate textures seen in an actual pie, which suggests a lack of a visible crumbly texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dark purple-blue berry filling with visible burst spots present in the pie slice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cartoon-style representation of the pie slice, where the berry filling is depicted in an exaggerated manner with large, uniform, and shiny berries, lacking any realistic detailing like burst spots. Cartoonishly illustrated berries often appear smooth without complex textures.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is a single green mint leaf placed on top of the pie slice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoonish pie slice features a simplistic drawing of a whole pie with large, clearly defined elements, including a single green mint leaf on top of the pie. This illustration style favors a minimalist and clear depiction of design elements.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the pie slice served on a white circular ceramic plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a depiction of a pie slice but no associated plate or real-world serving context is presented. It is a simple cartoon drawing intended to show the food item alone and does not include any indications of it being served on a plate.",

      "question": "Is the tea mug visible with a handle on the right side and a tea bag string hanging over the rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents cartoon representations of cups of coffee within an infographic, not realistic mugs with hanging tea bag strings. The cups are stylized, with some having faces and no visible tea bag strings. The cartoonish style lacks the detail of a real mug with a tea bag string hanging over the rim.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question": "Is the scene set on a smooth, matte gray tabletop surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a graphical infographic with a solid orange background and does not depict any environmental context or details like a tabletop surface. There is no representation of a setting typical of a real-world scene.",
