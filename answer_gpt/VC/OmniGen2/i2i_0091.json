      "question": "Is the original lighting style, including the placement and intensity of shadows, preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting style is characterized by a warm incandescent glow that casts soft shadows angled across the floor of a corridor. This indicates a different setting and light source arrangement from Image A, where natural light is evident. Comparing this with common knowledge about the first image's natural light entering from the left and creating sharp, distinct shadows, Image B's softer, horizontal shadow placement suggests that the lighting style has not been preserved.",

      "question": "Are the items on the chest of drawers arranged in a similar fashion to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting is a corridor with no visible furniture or clutter that can be associated with a chest of drawers or any items typically arranged on it. By analyzing Image A, one sees items such as books and potted plants on a chest of drawers. The absence of any furniture in Image B suitable for such arrangements indicates that the original arrangement style is not present here.",

      "question": "Is the wooden parquet flooring texture still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flooring is visible as tiled stone along a corridor, with a uniform and smooth matte surface typical of stone or ceramic tiles. This contrasts with the texture of parquet, which is intricate and usually made of small diagonal or patterned wooden pieces. The absence of any such wooden elements indicates the parquet flooring texture is not present in Image B.",

      "question": "Is there a large piece of furniture serving as the primary storage unit in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a long corridor with arched entries and no visible furniture that can be classified as a storage unit. There’s a prominent absence of such pieces which are typically solid, functional, and occupy the floor space. Conversely, Image A features a large wooden chest of drawers serving this purpose. The architecture and open space in Image B reinforce that no such furniture is present.",

      "question": "Is natural light still illuminating the scene from the same direction as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the light source appears to be artificial, as derived from the overhead lamp and softer shadows, differing from direct sunlight. In Image A, natural light enters from the left, casting clear shadows. The sunlight illuminating Image A’s scene indicates a different, stronger natural light source typically associated with sunlight at an angle. Thus, the direction and nature of light have changed.",
