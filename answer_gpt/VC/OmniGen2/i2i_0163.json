      "question": "Are the toasters still rectangular with a smooth metallic finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toasters are visually discernible and maintain their rectangular shape with a smooth surface, which appears metallic. The reflective nature and the typical geometric design of household toasters help confirm they are metallic and rectangular.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows slices of bread protruding from the slots of the toasters. These slices possess the characteristic toasted coloration, indicating toast marks created by heat exposure, commonly seen in toasted bread.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toasters exhibit distinct control knobs and levers, typical components for setting toasting parameters. They are black and clearly outlined against the metallic surface, highlighting their presence and functionality.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual examination of Image B reflects light on the surface of the toasters consistent with a metallic sheen. This is supported by the interplay of light and reflection typically associated with polished metal surfaces.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays two toasters positioned closely adjacent on a wooden surface, confirming their side-by-side arrangement. The toastersâ€™ alignment next to each other is evident from their location and orientation within the image frame.",
