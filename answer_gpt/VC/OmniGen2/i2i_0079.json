      "question": "Is the black drawer cabinet still present below the round mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black drawer cabinet is clearly visible below the round mirror. This is a consistent feature with Image A, suggesting stability in the room's design elements. The analysis is based solely on Image B first, without comparing Image A; since the cabinet's obvious physical features are identifiable, the answer can be confidently determined.",

      "question": "Does the image still feature a large round mirror above the drawer cabinet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a large round mirror prominently positioned above the black drawer cabinet. This setup aligns with common interior design aesthetics where such mirrors serve both functional and decorative purposes. The conclusion is drawn from evaluating Image B's clear indications of the mirror location and dimensions before comparing Image A.",

      "question": "Is natural light still entering the room from the window on the left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There’s no evidence of a window or light source on the left side in Image B. Without observable natural light coming from the left side, it can be concluded that there’s a potential absence of natural light from that specific side. A comparison with Image A would further underscore any changes regarding lighting and window placement, suggesting the absence of these now.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the potted plant with long green leaves visible in Image A is absent. Focused observation indicates there are no items resembling it in Image B. This brings clarity to its removal from Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floor in Image B seems to have a light texture similar to wood, which may suggest continuity of the wood style seen in Image A. This conclusion follows from the observed surface patterns and hue typical of light wood flooring materials.",
