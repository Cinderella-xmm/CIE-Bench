      "question": "Is the vase's overall shape preserved, including its three-panel body, twin scrolled handles, and flared neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is not traditional in its design. Instead of a conventional shape with specific features like a three-panel body, twin scrolled handles, and a flared neck, this vase is a crystal vessel with numerous angular facets shaped like petals. These facets converge at the base and create an intricate crystalline pattern. This is visually distinct and not similar to a traditional vase with the described features.",

      "question": "Does the bouquet extend beyond the rim of the vase, creating an overflowing effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers delicately arranged in the crystal vase do not exhibit an overflowing or cascading nature extending beyond the rim. Instead, the blooms are neatly positioned within the confines formed by the vase, creating a contained appearance, reinforced by the symmetrical arrangement of angular facets.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there scattered flowers on the surface of the pedestal, including at least one pink poppy and blue blooms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which features a crystal vase with several elegant blooms, there are no scattered flowers on the pedestal surface. The surface is clean and uncluttered, focusing on the carefully arranged artificial flowers. This arrangement contrasts with any notion of casual scattering as described.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal vase is centrally placed on the pedestal, visually balancing the frame. Given its precise positioning and symmetric design, the vase draws immediate focus, highlighting its intricate craftsmanship and the flowers within.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all the blossoms are contained within the crystal vase, without any resting on or touching the pedestal surface. The meticulous arrangement of the flowers emphasizes the decorative nature of the display, differentiating it from styles that suggest the presence of scattered or resting blooms.",
