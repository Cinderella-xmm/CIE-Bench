      "question": "Does the apple retain its glossy red skin with visible white specks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apple appears to retain its glossy red skin with visible white specks, similar to what can be expected from a typical red apple. The lighting highlights its shine which indicates a glossy texture. Common knowledge about red apples tells us that they often have white specks on their skin.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the short dried stem still present on the apple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each view of the apple, including the whole and cross-section representations, shows a distinct short dried stem on top. This aligns with typical apple features where a stem is commonly present, serving as the fruit's connection point to the tree.",

      "question": "Is the apple displayed on a wooden surface in all views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the apple against a consistent background resembling a wooden surface or a similar solid color backdrop. While the edited image focuses on the apple aspects more, the context suggests it is displayed in such a setting throughout all views.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the apple keep its realistic overall shape and volume in all views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apple in the whole view maintains a realistic shape, typical for apples with a slightly rounded bottom and pronounced curvature toward the top. The cross-section views also reflect realistic internal structures known for apples and maintain appropriate proportion, indicative of preserved realistic shape and volume.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "In the cross-section view, is the apple's flesh texture visible and consistent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits cross-section views of the apple that show a smooth and uniform flesh texture akin to what is expected when an apple is sliced. The visible seed cavities and clean cut additionally suggest consistency which is typical for apples.",
