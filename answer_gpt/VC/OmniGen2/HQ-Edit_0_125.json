      "question": "Is the woman’s face clearly visible with the same eye shape, nose, mouth, and short wavy black hair as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's face is blurred which obscures the facial features including the eye shape, nose, and mouth, while her hair remains short and wavy. In Image A, her face is visible and displays distinct features. Since Image B does not provide visibility for her facial features, the answer is drawn based on this observation.",

      ],

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a market alley or hanging rows of red paper lanterns. It shows the woman with lanterns on either side on a plain background. In contrast, Image A features lanterns hanging in a market alley setting. Therefore, the warm glow in a market alley setting isn't visible in Image B.",
