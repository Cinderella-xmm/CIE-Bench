      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a simple white grid pattern and does not feature any elements like a red train and metallic fence, which would be predominant features in a background. Based on this, the background from Image A, which does have these elements, is no longer present.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cartoon elephant character with a yellow hat and no vest; it has no reflective stripes. This differs significantly from Image A, where a worker wears a neon yellow vest with orange reflective stripes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character depicted is a cartoon elephant not holding a phone. Image A shows a worker holding a phone to their ear. Since there is no visual cue of a phone in Image B, the posture with a phone is not present.",

      "explanation": "Image B shows a cartoon elephant with a yellow hard hat, which is similar to the yellow hard hat worn by the worker in Image A. Despite the character change, both images share the common element of a yellow hard hat.",
