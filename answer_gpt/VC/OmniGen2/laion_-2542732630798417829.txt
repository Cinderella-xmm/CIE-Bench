    "Question": "Q1: Is the glass bulb shaped like a teardrop with visible internal filaments present?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, we see an illustration of a light bulb with a cartoon-like, smiling face. The characteristics that might indicate a teardrop shape, such as a rounded bottom with a tapering top, are absent. Instead, the bulb is simplified to fit a cartoon style, with no visible internal filaments. In contrast, Image A shows a realistic teardrop-shaped bulb with visible filaments. The reasoning behind this determination involves recognizing the artistic style used in Image B and the lack of realistic details that would signify a teardrop shape and filaments.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the curved vertical bars forming a cage-like structure around the bulb present?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a light bulb surrounded by a set of vertical lines that resemble a cage structure, though in a more stylized and cartoonish manner than Image A. The curved lines suggest a cage-like frame around the bulb but lack the realism seen in Image A. Here, the reasoning involves recognizing how the artist adapted the original design into a simpler cartoon style while maintaining some structural similarity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the dark cylindrical housing at the top of the fixture with a visible screw detail present?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the top of the bulb fixture with a dark domed shape that resembles the cylindrical housing seen in Image A. However, the cartoon style of Image B reduces intricate details such as screws. This analysis relies on identifying visual simplification typical in cartoons, where details like screws might be omitted or only suggested minimally.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the circular cap at the bottom of the metal cage present?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom of the fixture is depicted without any explicit circular cap at the base of the cage-like structure. The cartoon stylization focuses more on the bulb's face and less on structural details like a base cap. While Image A features such a detail, the reason for its absence in Image B relates to the simplification and reinterpretation common in cartoons.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the glass bulb positioned centrally within the metal cage?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a cartoon version of a bulb positioned centrally within its stylized cage-like structure. The positioning remains the same as in Image A, where the bulb is also centrally located within its cage. This confirms that despite the stylistic changes, the central positioning is preserved.",
    "answer": "Yes"
