    "Question": "Q1: Are the two garage doors positioned side by side on the lower front portion of the cabin, directly beneath the large upper window section?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no garage doors visible. Instead, the cabin features circular windows on the front side with symbols, and the architecture appears more fantasy-like. This is different from Image A, where two garage doors are apparent directly below a window section. Based on visual observation and common knowledge about fantasy settings, Image B lacks garage doors positioned beneath a large window section.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a large, multi-pane window section with exposed wooden beams located directly above the two garage doors, spanning most of the front width of the cabin?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays circular windows with symbols, typical of a fantasy setting, rather than a large multi-pane window section. There are no visible garage doors and therefore no large window section directly above them. Image A, however, does show such a feature which spans most of the width above garage doors, underlining the clear difference. Image B does not have the described window section.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a small rectangular window cut into the log wall on the left side of the cabin, near the front corner?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are only circular windows on the front of the cabin and no visible small rectangular windows on the log wall to the side. Image A contains a small rectangular window on the left side near the front corner. This shows that Image B doesn't have the window feature described.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a doorway located immediately to the right of the small rectangular window on the left side of the cabin?",
    "explanation": "Image B does have a doorway but it is located centrally on the front façade, not immediately to the right of a window by the corner of the left side. Comparatively, Image A does not show a doorway immediately beside a rectangular window on the left side, aligning with the observation that Image B lacks such a specific arrangement.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a continuous concrete foundation base running beneath the log walls of the cabin, visible along the lower perimeter?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the log walls meet the forest floor directly with no visible concrete foundation beneath them, consistent with fantasy aesthetic settings. In contrast, Image A shows a visible concrete foundation base running beneath the log walls. Image B lacks this architectural element.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the cabin oriented such that its front façade is angled slightly toward the right side of the image, with the left side receding into the background?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a cabin positioned with its front façade directly facing the viewer, without visible angling toward the right side. This orientation contrasts with Image A, where the cabin's front façade does appear slightly angled toward the right side of the image. Therefore, Image B does not have this specific orientation feature.",
    "answer": "No"
