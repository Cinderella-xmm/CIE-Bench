        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the upward-curving horn-like protrusions are present on either side of the top of the figure. This can be determined by observing the clear outline of these features against the background of the glass dome.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom of the totem still exhibits a diamond-patterned design. This is visible as a distinct band surrounding the lower section of the structure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a smooth, possibly polished appearance on the totem surface, indicating that the natural wood grain texture has been minimized or altered to appear less detailed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible middle and bottom faces of the totem feature closed eyes and open mouths, consistent with the description. The specific details inside the mouths like teeth are less prominent or are not distinctly visible compared to a detailed carving, leaving an interpretation of open and empty rather than explicitly showing teeth.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the bottom face larger than the middle face, which is larger than the top face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the bottom, middle, and top faces demonstrate a clear size progression where the bottom face is the largest and is followed by the smaller middle face. This arrangement supports the interpretation of the bottom face being larger than the others in the sequence.",
