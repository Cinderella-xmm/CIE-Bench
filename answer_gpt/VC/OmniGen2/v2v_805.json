      "question": "Is the text \"STORY PAGES\" present in uppercase serif font above the book?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the immediate context does not present the text 'STORY PAGES' in any form. Instead, the image focuses on a crystal ball containing an open book, surrounded by a warm and detailed indoor setting. There is no text overlay at the top of the image, which differs notably from what is described in the question. Given this context, it's clear the specific typography and positioning described do not appear in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the book have a visible spine and two cover edges forming an open structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features an open book inside a snow globe. The book is depicted with visible cover edges on both sides, suggesting an open structure. The placement within the snow globe, combined with the lighting, accentuates the sides of the book, indicative of its spine and cover edges forming a visibly open appearance, confirming this detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there multiple curved horizontal lines on both left and right sides of the book representing stacked pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The book inside the snow globe in Image B shows several curved horizontal lines, representative of stacked pages, on both sides. This visual feature enhances the portrayal of an open book, emphasizing the layered look typical of stacked pages present in an open book format, enhancing realism within the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the book centered horizontally and vertically beneath the text \"STORY PAGES\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The key visual arrangement in Image B does not include the text 'STORY PAGES' at all. Thus, there is no relationship of centering or positioning between the text and the book as described. Instead, the book is centrally enclosed within the snow globe, with surrounding elements dictating its prominent placement rather than text alignment. This discrepancy confirms the negative aspect regarding text and its positioning.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the book and text rendered in dark navy blue on a light beige background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals that the book is depicted in natural tones, surrounded by ambient lighting within the snow globe setup. The indoor setting uses warm colors like brown and gold, which dominate the background and foreground. The description of dark navy blue and light beige is inconsistent with this visual portrayal, indicating a different ambiance and artistic choice for Image B.",
