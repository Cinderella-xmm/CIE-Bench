    "Question": "Q1: Are distinct horizontal sedimentary layers visible in the rock face of the cliff?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the rock face is transformed into a figure with detailed armor design, and it does not display any natural cliff formation features such as horizontal sedimentary layers. The armor and body structure indicate a crafted design rather than natural formations. Thus, there are no visible sedimentary layers.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a bright, linear reflection of the sun visible on the water surface extending from the horizon?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the refraction of the sun on the water is seen as a bright linear reflection extending from the horizon across the water surface, similar to how sunlight naturally creates a reflection on water.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there multiple small boats visible on the water surface in the distance?",
    "explanation": "Image B appears to lack visible boats on the water surface, as the focus is predominantly on the transformed cliff figure and landscape, and no distinct shapes resembling boats are present.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are shrubs and small trees growing along the upper edges and crevices of the cliff?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, shrubs and small trees are visible on the upper edges and crevices of the cliff, maintaining natural vegetation alongside the embellished figure of the cliff.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are large, irregular boulders and grassy patches present in the foreground near the cliff edge?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases a grassy landscape integrated with the constructed figure, with the design of the figure incorporating natural elements like grassy patches and rocks, similar to large, irregular boulders.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the sun located low on the horizon, emitting a warm golden glow across the sky and water?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sun remains in a low position on the horizon, contributing a warm golden glow that spreads across the sky and reflects on the water, consistent with a sunset or sunrise effect.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the cliff edge form a steep, continuous drop-off directly into the water below?",
    "explanation": "Image B has the transformed cliff figure directly placed above the water without a steep, continuous drop-off. The figurative transformation disrupts the natural cliff formation of a direct drop into the water.",
    "answer": "No"
