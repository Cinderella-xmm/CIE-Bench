    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the two main mountain peaks still present and positioned side by side as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe two distinct mountain peaks prominently positioned side by side. The edited image's landscape is dominated by these two peaks, suggesting continuity from a typical landscape view. Without needing to refer to Image A, it's reasonable to conclude they remain unchanged in position, fulfilling the question's requirement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the summits of both peaks retain patches of snow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the summits of the two mountain peaks are observed to have visible patches of snow. This observation is likely due to the high elevation where snow persists despite other environmental factors. This aligns with typical mountainous regions' characteristics, where snow caps can remain. The analysis confirms the presence of snow patches on the peaks.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the horizontal and vertical rock strata visible on the mountain faces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents mountain faces with visible strata patterns, where distinct horizontal and possibly vertical lines can be seen. Such geological formations are characteristic of rock layers displaying different ages and compositions. The clarity of edited image effects may slightly obscure these, but they are indeed discernible.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the narrow road visible winding through the lower valley, extending toward the base of the mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an element that resembles a road or path winding through the valley towards the mountains' bases. This feature aligns with common landscape elements providing access and movement paths through mountainous terrain. The edited image retains enough detail to affirm the road's presence.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the slopes covered in patches of brownish-orange heather and dry grass, particularly in the mid-ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mid-ground shows slopes covered with vegetation that appears brownish-orange, typical of heather and dry grass in certain seasonal landscapes. The color distinctions are notable, even slightly exaggerated, suggesting this characteristic remains prevalent.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the sky uniformly overcast with no direct sunlight, resulting in soft shadows across the landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts an overcast sky devoid of direct sunlight, resulting in minimal, soft-shadow casting. The light source is diffuse, consistent with cloudy weather, influencing the overall subdued lighting effect on the landscape.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the valleys show smooth, continuous contour lines that follow the natural slope of the land?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the valleys appear to have smooth, continuous contour lines, indicating natural consistency in landscape slopes. This naturally occurring geographical feature follows typical terrain movements and shapes, suggesting minimal artificial interruption.",
