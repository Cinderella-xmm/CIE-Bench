      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figure is seen wearing a yellow shirt and a yellow headband, which is bright and vibrant in color.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figure is shown holding a tennis racket that has the familiar shape, featuring a rounded head, a grip, and strings.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the chibi figure with both hands positioned on the tennis racket, which indicates an active engagement with the racket and suggests the action of holding it.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figure is portrayed with a hair style that mimics the tousled and slightly wavy hair seen in Image A. This similarity can be noted by the attention to detail, where the chibi inherits the disheveled, dynamic aspect of the hair visible in the original player. Combining visual analysis from both images shows the transfer of this specific hair characteristic.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the posture of the chibi figure is similar to an athletic stance; knees slightly bent and arms placed ready on the tennis racket, which suggests an anticipation or readiness to engage in activity. This is contextually familiar in sports depictions, particularly in tennis, where such a stance is associated with being prepared for the next move.",
