      "question": "Does the edited image retain the curved shape of the bow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bow is depicted with a distinct curvature, similar to a traditional bow's shape. The bow's arc is clearly visible, indicating the retention of its curved form. Analyzing Image A, the bow is also shown with a similar curvature. The comparison shows that the essential curvature of the bow is maintained in the edited image.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the cylindrical shape of the quiver?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quiver is shown with vertical sides and a circular top, maintaining a cylindrical appearance. Examining Image A, the quiver also has a cylindrical structure. The shape is consistent in both images, confirming that the cylindrical shape of the quiver has been retained in the edited image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the arrangement and general form of the arrows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrows are seen protruding from the quiver, with multiple straight shafts and fletched ends visible above the quiver. This closely matches the arrangement found in Image A, where the arrows are similarly positioned and structured. The edited image has preserved the arrangement and general form of the arrows.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the position of the bow and quiver on the forest floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B positions the bow and quiver on a green, mossy forest floor, maintaining the arrangement seen in Image A where both items rest on the ground. Comparing both images, the relative positioning and placement on the forest floor are consistent, indicating that their position is retained in the edited image.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the natural woodland backdrop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a background with trees and green foliage that suggest a woodland setting, consistent with what is seen in Image A, where there is a natural forest backdrop. Comparing both images, the natural woodland environment is preserved in the edited image.",
