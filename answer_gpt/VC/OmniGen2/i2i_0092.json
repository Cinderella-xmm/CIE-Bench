      "question": "Is the main subject of the new scene (seaside café elements) centrally positioned on the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The main subject in the edited image is a cup placed on a table. From looking at the image, the cup appears to be centrally positioned on the table, making it the focal point of the composition. This is inferred from the evident positioning within the frame and the relation to the overall setup of the café scene. Therefore, visually it is clear the cup is centrally located on the table.",

      "question": "Does the new scene retain a clean and minimalistic style with no extraneous objects or clutter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a café scene with minimal components - primarily a cup on a saucer with a blurred background featuring more tables and a chair. The scene is uncluttered, and there are no extraneous items evident that might make it appear busy or messy. Drawing on world knowledge of minimalistic style, which is characterized by simplicity and lack of unnecessary elements, the image presents a clean aesthetic.",

      "question": "Is the perspective and composition of the new scene consistent with the original, providing a clear view of the seaside café tabletop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The perspective in the edited image is drawn from a slightly higher angle, allowing for a straightforward view of the tabletop and the seaside backdrop. In the original image, the perspective is also straightforward but focused on a device on a table. Comparing both, the edited image maintains clarity of the table surface, consistent with the aim of providing an unobstructed view of the café elements, albeit with a change in contents.",

      "question": "Are there distinct sunlight reflections visible on the table surface in the new scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the edited image, distinct sunlight reflections are clearly visible on the table surface. This is evident due to the bright patches and light gradients seen on the table, characteristic of sunlight reflecting off a smooth, light-colored surface. Combining visual observation and understanding of sunlight behavior, these reflections are apparent and contribute to the overall atmosphere of the scene.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Can you see subtle sea wave reflections in the background or on the table surface in the new scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination of the edited image, subtle sea wave reflections are visible in the background, depicted as shimmering light patterns and gradients on the sea. This common optical phenomenon occurs when sunlight is partially reflected off wave surfaces. However, these reflections are not directly visible on the table surface, as they are primarily captured in the distant sea view.",
