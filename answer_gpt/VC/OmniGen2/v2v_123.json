      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central character is distinctly holding a glowing blue orb.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B appears to employ a stylized or chibi format, often focusing on exaggerated characters and simple backgrounds. The detailed reflection of palm trees and sky as seen in Image A is not replicated in Image B, where such detailed environmental features are usually minimized for simplicity.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is much brighter and less atmospheric than the original Image A, showing clear skies and bright colors without the warm highlights typical of a golden-hour setting. The chibi style generally pursues a bright, even lighting that does not focus on the warmth of golden-hour aesthetics.",
