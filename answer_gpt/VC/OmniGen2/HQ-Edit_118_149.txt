    "Question": "Q1: Is the dancer’s left leg extended vertically upward in a full arabesque, with the right foot en pointe?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cutout ballerinas are portrayed in mid-performance poses suggestive of ballet movements. However, neither of the cutouts shows a dancer with the left leg extended vertically upward in a full arabesque position; instead, both are depicted with bent knees, characteristic of a different kind of ballet pose. The answer to whether the left leg is extended vertically in an arabesque, with the right foot en pointe, does not align with Image B's visuals.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are both feet wearing pink pointe shoes with visible ribbons wrapped around the ankles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the left figure is wearing pink pointe shoes that have visible ribbons wrapped around the ankles, characteristic of ballet shoes designed to provide support. However, the right figure is wearing blue pointe shoes which do not feature the pink hue. Thus, since not both figures are wearing pink pointe shoes, the answer would have to consider this detail.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the dancer’s hair styled into a tight, round bun at the top of her head?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both ballet dancer cutouts have their hair styled into tight, round buns. This is a common style for ballet dancers as it keeps the hair secure and out of the face during movement. The visual cues clearly show a classic ballet bun.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the dancer wear a sleeveless, fitted pink leotard paired with white tights?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the left ballerina cutout is wearing a sleeveless, fitted pink leotard paired with what seems like white tights, denoting traditional ballet attire. This matches the description given in the question.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is one arm extended forward and slightly out to the side, while the other grips the barre?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both figures have their arms raised in a ballet pose but without gripping a barre or having one arm distinctly separate from body posture in a way suggestive of holding onto something adjacent while performing a stretch. The poses are more uniform and abstract representations of ballet movement than being suggestive of interaction with other objects like a barre.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the dancer facing to the right side of the image, with her body in a side profile view?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both ballerinas are facing outward, neither exhibiting any direction towards the right side of the page in a profile view. Instead, the cutouts are symmetrical and posed directly facing the viewer, which suggests no singular directional profile.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is there a visible seam running down the center back of the leotard?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the simplistic and stylized design of the cutout figures excludes detailed elements such as a seam on the leotard. The focus is more on the silhouette and color, rather than intricate features like seams, which are not visible.",
    "answer": "No"
