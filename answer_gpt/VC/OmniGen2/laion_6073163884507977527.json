      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the two-tiered roof structure with a reddish-brown lower section and a dark, rough-textured upper section still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the house retains a similar roof structure to Image A, featuring a reddish-brown lower section that appears to be made of shingles or tiles, and a darker upper section possibly meant to represent a stone. The visual cues suggest that the roof design remains consistent in both images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the arched green door located at the front center of the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the house with a green door positioned at the front center, consistent with this description and placement as indicated in Image A. The visual information clearly shows the door's location, supporting an affirmative answer.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the oval-shaped window above the door and the rectangular window to its left still present in their original positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the oval-shaped window above the door is visible, as well as a rectangular window positioned to its left, similar to Image A. The windows maintain their respective positions, as visually indicated, supporting the conclusion that both windows are present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image A features a right wall with visible damage and exposed brickwork, Image B presents a more polished structure where these elements are not noticeable. The absence of visual cues associated with ruin or exposed brickwork suggests changes in the wall's appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B depict a rust-colored tree situated on the left side of the house. Its distinctive color and positioning are clearly visible, confirming its presence in the edited scene.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the low red brick wall adjacent to the rust-colored tree still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image A has a red brick wall next to the rust-colored tree, Image B incorporates the tree without this wall. The absence of visual evidence of the wall in Image B indicates it is no longer present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design of the scene has changed, and the depiction of the steps from Image A is replaced by a bridge over a pond leading to the house. This suggests the original steps are not present in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A features patches of moss-like vegetation around the house base and steps, while Image B shows managed grass surfaces without distinct moss patches near the base, due to the layout redesign. Therefore, visual cues suggest these vegetation patches are absent.",
