      "question": "Is the background composed of vertical wooden planks with patches of peeling red paint?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features vertical wooden planks with noticeable areas of peeling red paint. This observation aligns with the standard appearance of weathered, rustic wooden surfaces, which often have peeling paint due to age and exposure to the elements. The presence of red paint patches provides a distinct visual characteristic of the background.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floorboards made of rough, aged wood with visible grain and gaps between planks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In analyzing Image B, the floorboards appear to be of a rough and aged wooden texture, with the grain pattern and gaps between the planks visible. This is typical of wooden flooring that has experienced wear over time, leading to a rustic and timeworn appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a red circular reflector attached to the rear fender near the wheel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For Image B, there's no visible red circular reflector on the rear fender near the wheel. Instead, the most notable additions to the bicycle are related to the steampunk aesthetic, with mechanical gears and clock faces, rather than standard bicycle components like reflectors.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front handlebars do not feature a wire mesh basket. Instead, there's an elaborate steampunk design, including clock mechanisms and other components attached to the handlebars, which replace the utilitarian basket found in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area above the rear wheel does not show a standard metal luggage rack. Instead, it includes complex gears and clockwork, characteristic of a steampunk design. This differs from Image A, where a simple and practical luggage rack is visible.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are soft shadows cast by the bicycle onto the wall and floor, indicating directional lighting from the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting creates shadows near the bicycle, suggesting light coming from the left and casting these shadows onto the wall and floor. This lighting effect adds depth and dimensionality to the scene, typical in images with a primary light source from one direction.",
