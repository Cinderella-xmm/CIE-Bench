    "Question": "Q1: Is the golden-brown crust of the pie slice present with visible crumbly texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the visual depiction is a stylized illustration rather than a photo. The pie depicted is cartoonish with exaggerated features, such as bright colors and smooth surfaces that do not represent a realistic crumbly texture typical of a pie crust.
