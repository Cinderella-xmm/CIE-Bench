        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smartphone has a clearly defined rectangular shape with rounded edges. This shape is consistent with typical smartphone designs, which generally have rounded corners for aesthetic appeal and user comfort. Therefore, the shape observed aligns with real-world smartphone designs. The analysis considers standard geometric characteristics of common smartphones.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a prominent circular feature located at the bottom center of the smartphone's front surface. Based on common smartphone designs, this corresponds to a home button, as many devices have a central button in that position for ease of access. The recognition relies on typical smartphone design elements, focusing on standard placements for navigation buttons.",

      "question": "Is the charging cable visibly connected to the phone's charging port and leading to the charging pad?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a visible charging cable connected to the left side, presumed to be in the phone's charging port, and extending towards the charging pad. Common sense indicates this setup is integral for wired charging, where a cable links the device to a power source. This observation is based on typical charging configurations, where the cable acts as the intermediary for power transfer from the pad.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smartphone appears to be lying flat against the surface of the charging pad. Flat placement is typical for wireless charging setups to ensure optimal contact. Accordingly, the visual assessment pairs with wireless charging principles, which prioritize surface contact for efficient energy transfer.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a consistent green background without additional textures or objects. A solid color background aids focus and clarity in product photography, aiding in visual clarity. This feature is used extensively to highlight the main subjectâ€”a practice observed across tech product displays.",
