      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the faceted star-shaped pattern covering the body of the perfume bottle preserved in the Lego version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the perfume bottle is covered with a repeating geometric pattern resembling diamonds or domes rather than star-shaped designs. This indicates that the faceted star-shaped pattern is not preserved in the edited version. Star shapes usually consist of pointed angles or intersecting lines, which are absent here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the perfume bottle maintain its cylindrical shape with tapered sides and flat base in the Lego construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a bottle with a structure resembling an elongated octagonal or polygonal prism, lacking the cylindrical shape. Cylindrical forms are typically smoothly rounded without angles, which contradicts the presence of geometric facets here, thus not maintaining the tapered cylindrical appearance.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the gold faceted spherical cap positioned at the top of the bottle preserved in the Lego version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a gold cap at the top of the bottle, with a faceted, geometric design similar to a spherical shape but with flat surfaces, indicating that the overall design and position are retained. The cap preserves the color and roughly the same geometric styling as seen commonly in decorative caps of perfume bottles.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the spray nozzle located on the side of the bottle’s neck, with a visible mist plume extending diagonally outward, preserved in the Lego version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spray nozzle is clearly visible, placed at the side of the bottle’s neck, with a mist plume extending diagonally, resembling the behavior of a spray in real liquids. This setup is preserved from typical perfume bottle designs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the undulating folds of the fabric background beneath the bottle preserved in form and position in the Lego version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a solid, flat-colored background, without any fabric folds or textures underneath the bottle. This differs from Image A, where a rich, textured fabric with folds is visible, indicating the lack of preservation in the edited version.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the perfume bottle positioned directly on top of the fabric background, maintaining contact and alignment with the folds, in the Lego version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks any fabric background, instead showcasing a solid, smooth surface on which the bottle stands. This contrasts with Image A, where the bottle is visibly positioned on a textured fabric. Thus, the positioning on the fabric is not maintained in the Lego version.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the size of the gold cap proportionally consistent with the body of the bottle in the Lego version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold cap is proportionally similar to the body of the bottle, resembling typical proportions seen in perfume bottles where the cap's size complements the bottle's structure. This proportionality is consistent with expectations and design practices, maintaining a balance in size between the cap and bottle body.",
