      "question": "Is the vertical cluster of lavender-like flowers with fuzzy purple petals present in the same structural arrangement as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flower arrangement shows a vertical cluster of lavender-like flowers on each side. The similarity in structure is evident as these clusters are prominent features in both images. This assessment is based on the visual consistency of the flower arrangement in the foreground, common to both images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a single blue flower with a yellow center located at the top of the flower cluster?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a blue flower with a yellow center. Instead, the imagery is more focused on a magical or fantastical theme with wings and floral designs as part of the fairy's attire. The original image (Image A) includes a discernible blue flower at the top of the cluster, which seems to be missing in Image B.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the butterfly positioned with its legs touching the flower stem, maintaining physical contact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no butterfly depicted. Instead, a fairy-like figure replaces any butterflies, highlighting a fantasy element. Thus, no butterfly is positioned or making contact with any flower in the edited image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the wings of the butterfly fully spread in a side profile view, showing both left and right wings symmetrically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's wings are featured on a fairy, not a butterfly, and these wings appear spread in a frontal view with no side profile symmetry involved. Given that Image B lacks a butterfly, the symmetry observed in the wings of an archetypal butterfly is absent.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighting in the image coming from above, casting a warm golden glow over the butterfly and flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits lighting effects consistent with a night sky theme, with sparkling stars and bluish tones. This suggests the light source is not casting a warm golden glow, unlike Image A, which contains warm tones and a golden glow indicative of overhead lighting.",
