      "question": "Is the framed landscape painting with a dark wooden frame and a scene depicting ducks near water present above the sofa?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the painting with a dark wooden frame is still visible in the same position above the sofa as in Image A. The content of the painting, depicting a nature scene with ducks near water, is unchanged. Common sense tells us that framed paintings typically remain in the same location and are not usually altered in content within the same setting, unless deliberately edited.",

      "question": "Is the wall behind the sofa a consistent cream color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall behind the sofa maintains the same cream color as seen in Image A. This consistent cream color suggests a uniform paint finish without any discoloration or pattern changes that are often used in indoor settings for neutrality and warmth.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the floor covered in a light beige textured carpet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flooring retains the appearance of a light beige textured carpet, which is consistent with indoor decor choices aiming for warmth and comfort. This observation is also noted in Image A, confirming that the carpet's texture and color were not altered between the images.",

      "question": "Is there a white baseboard molding running along the bottom of the wall behind the sofa?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we can see a white baseboard molding running along the bottom of the wall behind the sofa, just as in Image A. Baseboard molding is a common architectural feature for protecting walls and adding a decorative boundary, which remains consistent between both images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a portion of a second brown leather armchair visible on the far left, which matches the positioning in Image A. This suggests an unchanged room layout where such furniture pieces are typically arranged to complement a seating area.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, soft shadows are visible beneath the sofa indicative of indoor ambient lighting. These shadows are consistent with Image A as well, which suggests that the image was captured with similar lighting conditions that did not change despite the sofa's altered appearance.",
