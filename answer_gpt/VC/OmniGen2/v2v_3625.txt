    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the representation of a navigational tool (map)?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background is composed of colorful mosaic tiles depicting floral patterns, typically used for decorative purposes rather than navigation. These visual cues strongly suggest that the image does not feature a navigational tool like a map. Using common sense, maps contain information like geographical and road details, which are absent in this patterned tile arrangement.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there identifiable markers (pins) indicating specific locations/routes on the map?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows several pins placed on mosaic tiles. While the pins can typically suggest locations or routes if placed on a map, here they are merely on decorative tiles without any geographical significance. Common sense tells us that such pins on non-geographic surfaces don't denote specific locations or routes.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a visible hand interacting with the map, specifically placing a marker?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a hand is visibly interacting with the pins on the tiles, which could suggest placement activity. However, since these tiles don't form a map, it contradicts the concept of a hand placing markers on a navigational map. The action is limited to pins on a decorative surface only.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the markers (pins) visibly connected, suggesting a planned route?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays three pins: two orange and one green, connected by green threads. While this suggests a connection between points, the lack of a geographical context like a map means the visual outcome does not reflect a planned route in the traditional sense. The connection is merely decorative.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the edited image retain the wooden surface and the beige sweater sleeve as part of the scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sleeve is visible and remains beige, indicative of retained wardrobe continuity. However, the surface is now made of mosaic tiles rather than wood, marking a significant change in material and visual context. These observations come directly from the visual differences observed in the image.",
    "answer": "No"
