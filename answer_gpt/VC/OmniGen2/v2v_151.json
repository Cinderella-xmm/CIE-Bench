      "question": "Does the tiger retain its distinctive stripe pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger displays a prominent and consistent stripe pattern across its body. This pattern is a key characteristic of both real and cartoon representations of tigers. The stripes in Image B are bold and clearly drawn, maintaining the tiger's identity. By observing the pattern in Image A, it is evident that tigers have distinctive dark stripes that contrast with the lighter fur. Therefore, in comparison, the edited image has retained this signature tiger pattern, indicating accurate portrayal. The preservation of this pattern is crucial for it to still be recognized as a tiger.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger is visibly holding a skateboard with its paws, which is apparent by the grip and position of the paws wrapped around the skateboard. This gripping action mimics natural animal behavior of clutching objects, allowing the tiger to effectively hold onto the skateboard. Image A shows the tiger holding the skateboard similarly, confirming that this characteristic has been carried over in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skateboard depicted in Image B clearly displays a yin-yang symbol on its underside. This symbol is a recognizable design element that stands out due to its high contrast black and white coloring. Image A also features a yin-yang symbol, which confirms the similarity between the two images in this particular aspect of the skateboard design. The consistent presence of this symbol indicates continuity from the original to the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the tiger wearing a cap, which bears resemblance to a military-style design due to its structured shape and insignia positioned at the front. This type of cap design is often associated with formal or uniform attire, commonly seen in military settings. Image A displays the tiger in a cap of a similar style, signifying that the military-style cap has been preserved in the transition from the original to the edited image.",

      "question": "Does the tiger maintain a seated posture similar to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger stands upright in a natural, animated style, which contrasts with Image A's depiction of the tiger in a seated posture. Image A illustrates the tiger sitting on its haunches, a typical resting posture for larger felines. The shift from a seated to upright posture in Image B represents a significant alteration in the tiger's position, altering its presence and style while emphasizing a more playful and dynamic stance.",
