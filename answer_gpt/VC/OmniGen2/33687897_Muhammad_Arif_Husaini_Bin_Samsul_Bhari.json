    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the silhouetted tree branches in the foreground clearly visible and retaining their original shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouettes of tree branches in the foreground are visible, maintaining clarity and definition against the sky. Despite the addition of the large lion-like figure, the branches appear to retain their relative shape and position as seen in Image A, suggesting continuity in that particular aspect of the scene.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the small green hilltop with sparse vegetation visible just above the mist layer in the mid-ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hilltop with sparse vegetation is obscured by the large lion-like figure standing in the mid-ground. In Image A, this area is visible just above the mist layer. The introduction of a massive figure in Image B completely covers this hilltop area, making it not visible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sky retain its original gradient from deep blue at the top to soft pink and lavender near the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky retains a similar gradient as in Image A, transitioning from a deep blue at the top to shades of pink and lavender towards the horizon. This gradient is visible behind the lion-like figure, indicating that the original color transition of the sky remains intact.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a continuous layer of mist or fog extending horizontally beneath the mountain, obscuring its lower slopes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the layer of mist is replaced by the large lion-like figure. The mist that originally extended horizontally and obscured the mountain's lower slopes in Image A is now largely blocked or replaced by this new element in the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the foreground trees, mid-ground hill, and background mountain arranged in their original relative positions, maintaining the depth of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground trees are still present, but the mid-ground hill and the mountain are obscured by the large lion-like figure. While the foreground maintains its position relative to the viewer, the depth involving the mid-ground and background is disrupted by the figure, altering their visible positions in the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the tree branches retain their original fine details, including individual twigs and leaf clusters, in silhouette form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree branches maintain their silhouette form and fine details such as individual twigs and leaf clusters, similar to Image A. Despite being framed around a new central figure, their intricate details remain unchanged, contributing to the continuity of the scene's periphery.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the peak of the mountain still positioned at the highest point in the scene, serving as the central focal point?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain peak is entirely obscured by the new lion-like figure which serves as the new central focal point. In Image A, the mountain peak is notable for being the highest point in the scene. The rearrangement of elements in Image B makes the mountain peak neither visible nor the focal point.",
