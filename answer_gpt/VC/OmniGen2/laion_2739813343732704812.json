    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a visible gular pouch located beneath the lower mandible of the beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cartoonish pelican characterized by exaggerated features and not meant for realistic detail. While there is an attempt to depict a gular pouch beneath the pelican's beak, it's overly simplified and lacks the volume or definition typically seen in real life; however, a basic representation is present visually.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the feet clearly webbed with visible claws at the tips of each toe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican's feet are cartoonishly illustrated with a simplified, non-detailed style. The presence of webbing isn't explicitly visible as it would be in a realistic depiction, and claws are not detailed. The design emphasizes a stylized format rather than anatomical accuracy.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the feathers on the body composed of layered, striated structures with visible individual feather shafts and overlapping edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The feathers in Image B are depicted with a smooth, stylized illustration focusing on shape and color rather than detailed texture. There are no visible individual feather shafts or overlapping feather edges, indicating an absence of the specific striated structure seen in real-life birds.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bird have a long neck curving down from the head to a broad, rounded body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a long neck that curves slightly into a rounded body, consistent with the standard cartoon portrayal of a pelican. The depiction takes liberties with form for quirky aesthetics rather than perfect biological representation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are both legs positioned under the body, supporting the pelican in a grounded standing pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features cartoon illustration showing two legs and feet ostensibly supporting the body in a standing position. The style adjusts proportions for an aesthetic cartoon effect but maintains a 'standing pose' concept.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a single dark, round eye visible on the side of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pelican in Image B is depicted with large, expressive eyes typical of cartoon characters. Unlike a single dark, round eye seen on most realistic birds, Image B shows both eyes frontally, indicating a stylized depiction departing from realism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a small tuft of feathers raised at the crown of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican wears a sailor hat that covers the top of its head, leaving no room or need for additional feather details such as a crown tuft. The cartoon focuses more on humor and thematic presentation than anatomical details.",
