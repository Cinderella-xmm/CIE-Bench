      "question": "Are the two cars in the image identifiable as the same models shown in the original, with the same body shapes and design features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two cars appear to have similar overall body shapes and design features as seen in Image A.

      "question": "Are the red traffic lights still visible above the cars, maintaining their original function as stop signals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the red traffic lights located above the cars, which are standard signaling devices used to regulate traffic flow by indicating when vehicles should stop. The lights are illuminated red, showing that they maintain their original function as stop signals.",

      "question": "Are the lane markings on the road clearly visible and consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lane markings appear as white dashed lines on the road, similar to those in Image A. These are standard indicators of vehicle lanes used to guide traffic and ensure safety. The visibility and consistency of these markings between the two images allow for easy navigation down a multi-lane road.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the urban environment, such as the presence of trees and traffic lights along the roadside, is visible and matches the elements seen in Image A. The coherence of these environmental features highlights the urban setting, with trees lining the street and red traffic lights regulating the traffic above the vehicles.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The positioning of the cars in Image B shows them parallel to each other in the same lanes as in Image A. This parallel orientation is consistent with typical traffic flow, suggesting that the vehicles were stationary at a traffic signal in both images.",
