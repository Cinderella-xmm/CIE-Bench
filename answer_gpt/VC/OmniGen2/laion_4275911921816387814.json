    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the blade visibly curved in the same manner as in the original image, extending from the guard to a pointed tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, I observed the blade and noted that it is curved similarly to the blade observed in Image A. Both images display a prominent curve typical of a traditional dagger design, extending from the guard towards the tip. The images show a similar curvature, leading to the conclusion that the edited image retains the same curve as the original.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the hilt retain the segmented, block-like pattern along its length, similar to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When analyzing Image B, the hilt appears to maintain the segmented, block-like pattern seen in Image A. Both images show a pattern made of rectangular blocks along the hilt, indicating that the edited image preserves the original hilt design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the guard decorated with intricate floral and geometric patterns, matching the original design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a guard that does not contain the intricate patterns observed in the original Image A. Image A's guard is adorned with floral and geometric designs, whereas Image B's guard has simplified and minimal patterns, indicating a difference in decoration.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the blade covered with a dense black filigree pattern, matching the original in layout and coverage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blade features some markings, but they are not in the dense black filigree pattern seen in Image A. The original blade is densely decorated with black filigree, which contrasts with the simple and sparse patterns in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the proportions between the hilt, guard, and blade preserved, with the blade being longer than the hilt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the proportions between the hilt, guard, and blade that appear consistent with Image Aâ€”specifically, the blade is longer than the hilt in both images. This observation aligns with the typical dagger proportions where the blade length exceeds the hilt length.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the blade end in a pointed tip, consistent with the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blade culminates in a rounded tip, differing from the pointed tip seen in Image A. The original image clearly shows a sharp point typical of dagger blades, whereas the edited image features an altered tip, concluding my observation of a discrepancy.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the dagger positioned diagonally across the frame, from upper left to lower right, as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the positioning, both Image A and Image B show the dagger aligned diagonally across the frame. The blade's layout from upper left to lower right is consistent in both images, matching the spatial orientation.",
