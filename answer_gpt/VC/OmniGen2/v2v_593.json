      "question": "Does the Funko Pop figure retain the large hind legs characteristic of a kangaroo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Funko Pop figure is shown with extended back legs that are prominent compared to the rest of the body, which fits the chibi design style â€” oversized or exaggerated features for emphasis. Kangaroos are known for their large and strong hind legs used for jumping, and this aspect seems to be represented in an exaggeratedly cute manner in Image B, retaining the character's distinctive attribute.",

      "question": "Is the long tail of the kangaroo preserved in the Funko Pop figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the Funko Pop figure displays a tail, albeit shorter in respect to its overall size compared to a real kangaroo. In terms of chibi or toy design, realistic proportions are often altered to achieve a cute or compact look; however, the presence of a tail indicative of a kangaroo remains clear.",

      "question": "Does the chibi-style kangaroo figure inside the box include a pouch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A close inspection of the chibi-style figure within the packaging of Image B shows no visible kangaroo pouch. While pouches are a defining trait of female kangaroos, this stylistic representation might have simplified or excluded this feature for design or manufacturing purposes.",

      "question": "Is the Funko Pop figure primarily colored brown to reflect the original kangaroo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Funko Pop figure shows a predominantly reddish-brown coloration, which matches the brown coat of the kangaroo in Image A. Typically, toy designers use similar color palettes to reflect the original subject matter, reinforcing identification even in stylized forms.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the hopping-related elements (hind legs and tail) depicted in the chibi-style figure inside the box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style figure inside the box in Image B shows both hind legs and a tail, although they are stylized in line with the toy's chibi design. These elements are characteristic of a kangaroo and essential for depicting the animal's hopping ability. Both are present, albeit with exaggerated features as expected in chibi design.",
