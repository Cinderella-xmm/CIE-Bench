      "question": "Are the eyes positioned symmetrically within the face, with a slight upward slant at the outer edges and gazing directly forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blur obscures the facial features, making it impossible to determine the positions or angles of the eyes. Therefore, the question cannot be accurately answered due to the blur.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the blur covering the face in Image B, the shape and alignment of the nose cannot be evaluated.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blur in Image B prevents the observation of the lips, making it impossible to describe their shape or expression.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the face proportionally balanced, with equal spacing between the eyes and symmetrical distribution of facial features?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blur obscures the face's features in Image B, making it impossible to judge the proportional balance or symmetry of the facial features.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left ear's visibility cannot be assessed because of the covering blur.",

      "question": "Are there soft shadows along the right side of the face and under the jawline, created by directional lighting from the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blur in Image B covers areas where shadows would typically be identified, making it impossible to determine any lighting effects on the face.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the face being blurred, the overall outline of the head and its position above the shoulders can still be assessed, and it appears centered without visible tilts or rotations.",
