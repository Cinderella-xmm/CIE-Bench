      "question": "Is the pyramid visible in the background to the right of the Sphinx, with a clear triangular silhouette against the sunset sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, analyzing the background to the right of the structure (which resembles a Sphinx), there is a visible shape with a triangular silhouette that is distinctly recognizable as a pyramid. This is based on the common visual depiction of pyramids in landscapes with a sharp triangular peak set against the sky.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the sun positioned low on the horizon, directly behind the Sphinx, emitting a bright circular glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's a bright circular object positioned low on the horizon behind the structure that resembles a Sphinx, emitting a distinct circular glow. The characteristics and positioning relative to the horizon suggest this is visually represented as the sun at sunset or sunrise.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a dense layer of clouds below the Sphinx, appearing illuminated with orange and pink hues from the sunset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, beneath the structure resembling a Sphinx, there appears to be a dense layer of clouds present. These clouds are illuminated with orange and pink hues, likely due to the lighting effects from a sunset sky, creating a visual gradient indicative of sunset or sunrise lighting conditions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the Sphinx facing toward the right side of the image, with its profile visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure that resembles a Sphinx is positioned with its profile facing the right side of the image. This is based on the orientation of the head and body structure, commonly associated with the appearance and depiction of a Sphinx in art and photographs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the sky show a smooth gradient from warm orange near the horizon to cooler purple and pink tones at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B demonstrates a clear gradient starting with warm orange tones near the horizon transitioning to cooler purple and pink hues at the top. This visual effect is typical for a sunset sky, creating a gradient effect due to the scattering of sunlight.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible horizontal erosion lines and layered textures on the lower portion of the Sphinxâ€™s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower portion of the structure resembling the Sphinx showcases horizontal erosion lines and layered textures. These features are commonly seen on structures such as the Sphinx due to natural weathering over time, contributing to their historical and weathered appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there sand visible around the base of the Sphinx, particularly near the front paws and lower body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the structure resembling the Sphinx does not appear to have sand visibly present around it, such as near the front paws and lower body. Instead, the area below appears mostly occupied by the dense cloud layer and is not indicative of a sandy base typical of desert settings.",
