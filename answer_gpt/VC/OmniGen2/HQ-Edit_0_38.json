      "question": "Is the man’s white beard and mustache clearly present and retaining their original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beard and mustache are not visible as the face is blurred. The visual information shows no clear presence or shape of these facial features. Thus, their original form is not retained due to the editing. Common knowledge suggests that when an image is blurred, specific details such as facial hair are usually obscured.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flat cap is clearly positioned on top of the man's head, and the button is visible. This is confirmed by the visual clues indicating texture and form consistent with a tweed cap. The editing did not alter the cap's placement or its button.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's right hand is depicted gripping the cane near the lower portion of the handle. The visual cues show the hand in a similar position, suggesting no change in grip compared to the original image.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, dark purple grape clusters are visible on the right side near the man's shoulder, hanging from green leaves. The editing appears to maintain the natural depiction of grape clusters in this region.",
