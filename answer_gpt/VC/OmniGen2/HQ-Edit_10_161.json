      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, observe the geometric patterns, colors and background. The dress showcases orange-brown diamond shapes with spiral centers against a turquoise blue background.

In Image A and Image B, the geometric pattern on the dress is identical, with the same orange-brown diamond shapes on a turquoise blue background in both. Therefore, the dress retains the exact geometric pattern in the edited image.",
