    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes almond-shaped with a grayish-blue iris and visible upper and lower eyelashes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nature of the image is more of a stylized, cartoon-like design, which typically lacks detailed facial features such as specific eye shapes, iris colors, or eyelashes. In such art styles, eyes are often represented in a simplistic manner. Based on this analysis, the features expected in a realistic setting do not apply here.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a receding hairline with thin, light gray hair present only on the sides and back of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a cartoonish character with simplistic and exaggerated features. The hair is depicted in large solid shapes and lacks the detailed texture of thin, light gray hair or a receding hairline. Instead, it is more of a solid brown typical of cartoon imagery.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the shirt have thin vertical red and white stripes running along the collar and down the placket on a dark blue background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt of the cartoonish character is designed with bright, thick horizontal stripes in multiple colors, consistent with a playful, simplified design common in cartoon art. These features differ from the reality-based design elements described in the question.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible white button at the top of the shirtâ€™s placket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shirt in Image B is illustrated in a cartoonish manner, displaying simplified and exaggerated features. Buttons are likely to be designed as large and stylized rather than accurately representing realistic placement or size, which is a common trait in cartoon designs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the gray blazer have a notched lapel with a defined edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the cartoonish representation seen in Image B, tailored details such as a notched lapel with a defined edge are typically simplified. The focus is on bold outlines and colors rather than intricate detailing, making such specific styles unlikely to be depicted accurately.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are fine lines visible around the eyes and forehead, and is the skin texture subtly detailed with pores?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given the highly stylized and cartoonish nature of Image B, the character is unlikely to feature realistic skin textures or fine lines. Such details are generally not included in cartoon depictions as they focus on broader shapes and lack the subtle detailing found in realistic imagery.",
