      "question": "Are there exactly eight upright objects arranged in a tight vertical cluster within the container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are seven upright makeup brushes with clear handles arranged in a vertical position within the container. The brushes have varying tips which indicate they are makeup tools. Based on the count of these brushes, the number is seven rather than eight.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a bed of small, uniformly shaped spherical objects filling the lower portion of the container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the container does not contain any small, spherical objects. Instead, there are clear makeup brushes with colorful ends visible within the container, which rests directly on the container's bottom.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a container with a decorative lace band wrapped around the upper part of the container. This band is positioned below the rim, not precisely at the upper rim, as expected commonly with decorative bands.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the container is transparent with a textured design allowing visibility of the makeup brushes inside. The contents are clearly visible from outside the container due to this transparency, typical of glass or clear plastic containers.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The objects in the container of Image B, notably makeup brushes, are positioned vertically, with their tips pointing upward. This positioning is consistent with the arrangement of brushes or similar upright tools for easy access.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there at least three distinct sizes of objects visible in the cluster (large, medium, small)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features seven makeup brushes, each of uniform height despite their varied brush tip designs. Given their consistent height, there are not different sizes characterized in the cluster, so not at least three distinct sizes.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the container resting on a flat, horizontal surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the container rests on what appears to be the glass top of a piece of furniture, which is a flat and horizontal surface. This typical arrangement ensures stability and accessibility of the items inside.",
