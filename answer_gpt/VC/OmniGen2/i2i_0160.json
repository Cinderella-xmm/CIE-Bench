      "question": "Do the birds retain their original feather patterns including the brown and white colors and striated wing markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the birds still display features that include brown coloring on their bodies, white colors on specific parts, and wings with striated markings. These are consistent with the natural feather patterns visible in certain small perching birds. Such patterns are often distinctive and contribute to their identification. Thus from the visual cues in Image B, the birds seem to retain their original feather patterns.",

      "question": "Are the birds still perched on the branch with their beaks open as if singing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the birds are positioned in such a way that they are perched on a branch. Their beaks are open, which can be interpreted as though they are singing or calling out to one another. This open-beak posture is often associated with communication or singing behavior in birds.",

      "question": "Is the branch still present with the same structure and positioning beneath the birds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the birds perched on a branch that maintains a similar structure and positioning beneath them. The branch has the same curvature and supports the birds in a way consistent with Image A, demonstrating continuity in its presence and form.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves can be seen surrounding the birds, maintaining their shape and contributing to the scene's natural ambiance. This aligns with the presence of leaves in Image A, indicating that the leaves in Image B have retained their visual characteristics and original positions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The birds in Image B are still highlighted by lighting effects, noticeable through the contour and illumination along their bodies, particularly around the neck and wing areas. Such lighting accentuates their form and detail, maintaining a sense of three-dimensional presence, even though the background has changed from a bright sunlit scene to a nighttime setting with moonlight.",
