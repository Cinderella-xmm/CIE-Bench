      "question": "Are the dark wooden beams forming geometric patterns on the facades of the buildings clearly visible and structurally accurate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the buildings appear inside a spherical object, creating a distorted view. The dark wooden beams on the facades are visible, forming geometric patterns typical of half-timbered houses, even within the spherical distortion. Despite this alteration, they appear structurally accurate within the confines of the sphere. Common sense dictates that such architectural features have a symmetrical and consistent design, which is consistent with the appearance in the edited image.",

      "question": "Do the buildings feature steeply pitched gabled roofs with dormer windows positioned at regular intervals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unique spherical reflection might obscure details like dormer windows, but the steeply pitched gabled roofs characteristic of traditional European architecture are still visible. Dormer windows are typically positioned regularly on such roofs to allow for attic ventilation and daylight, but they may not be clearly visible due to the distortion. Based on common understanding of such architecture in conjunction with the image, these typical features might appear less distinct, hinting that their regularity and visibility are compromised.",

      "question": "Is there a pedestrian bridge spanning the canal in the mid-ground, connecting the two sides of the street?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B produces a sphere-contained miniature view of the original scene. The pedestrian bridge visible in the original Image A appears to be present in Image B as well, connecting the two sides of the canal, which is discernible despite the spherical distortion. The presence of this structural connector is a typical feature of such waterside urban designs in European towns.",

      "question": "Does the canal surface reflect the surrounding buildings and sky with clear, mirror-like fidelity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the spherical and distorted presentation, the canal's surface adjusts to the curvature of the reflection. While the overall appearance gives the impression of a watery surface, the fidelity of reflection isn't mirror-like, as the spherical distortion likely compromises the clarity consistent with a true mirror reflection.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there flower boxes containing green plants visible along the balcony of the large building on the right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, the spherical imagery and scale make detailed features like flower boxes difficult to catch with precision. However, some green elements suggesting the presence of flower boxes can be observed on the right structure, likely displayed as compact green elements, even if less distinct than in the undistorted original view.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are stone bases and metal railings present along the canal edges beneath the buildings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sphere's curvature could obscure specific materials. However, the appearance of stone bases and metal-like reflections suggest that these components are represented, adhering to traditional canal-side architectural designs that utilize durable materials such as stone and metal for support and safety.",

      "question": "Are the windows arranged in vertical and horizontal lines on the facades, matching the timber frame divisions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the spherical distortion in Image B, the windows generally follow the geometric pattern of vertical and horizontal lines, characteristic of symmetry in half-timbered architecture. This structural integrity, although curved, is discernible, supporting their alignment with the timber frames.",
