        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a structure that appears to be the Eiffel Tower, with its recognizable lattice iron framework, four arched legs, and tapered spire. This design is iconic and consistent with the Eiffel Tower's architectural style. The visual cues present in Image B match my world knowledge of the Eiffel Tower's design.",

      "question": "Is the rectangular reflecting pool positioned directly in front of the Eiffel Tower, aligned along the central axis of the composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a rectangular reflecting pool directly in front of the Eiffel Tower, and its position appears to be aligned along the central axis of the composition, leading up to the tower. This typical design helps direct visual attention towards the main subject, the Eiffel Tower, a common architectural technique.",

      "question": "Are the pathways and tree arrangements in the foreground arranged symmetrically around the central axis leading to the Eiffel Tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pathways and tree arrangements in the foreground appear to have a symmetrical design around the central axis that leads to the Eiffel Tower. This symmetry is a frequent landscape design choice, especially in formal garden layouts, facilitating a balanced and harmonious view.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the background of Image B, a spire-shaped building is clearly visible to the left of the Eiffel Tower. This specific architectural silhouette suggests the presence of other notable buildings often seen in city landscapes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sun is prominently positioned in the sky, but it is located in the upper-center portion rather than the upper-left. This is evident from the central positioning of its bright rays affecting the lighting and atmosphere in the image.",
