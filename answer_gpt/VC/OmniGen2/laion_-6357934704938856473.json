      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the red eye lenses present in the head of the robot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot has a helmet-like head that matches typical robot designs featuring eye lenses. However, the image taken within a box limits my ability to see the eyes clearly. Usually, robots have distinct lenses to indicate visual sensors, which are often colored with striking colors like red. The design suggests there would be red eye lenses, but due to limited visibility, it's unclear without closer inspection.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there three orange circular thruster nozzles on each foot of the robot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's feet appear to have circular objects that could be thruster nozzles. It's common in robot designs to have thruster nozzles for movement or stability, often with functional and color-coded indicators like orange on mechanical designs. Based on the visual detail, these orange elements suggest functionality like thruster nozzles.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is a long, straight sword being held in the robot’s left hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot is holding a weapon in its left hand, which is visibly a long, straight sword. Sword designs are straightforward with consistent shapes, allowing for easy identification, especially when the grip and elongated blade are visible, as seen here. The sword is an integral part of this robot's design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there two wing-like structures on the back of the robot, each with an orange tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot features two protrusions on its back resembling wings. These structures have orange tips, which are a common aesthetic treatment in robot design to denote functionality or style. The combination of shape and color points to them being wing-like additions to the robot's silhouette.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is a long rifle being held in the robot’s right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's right hand holds a weapon resembling a rifle. The distinct elements like the length, barrel design, and grip suggest it's a rifle. Robots often wield various weapons as part of their design, with rifles being a typical choice for added tactical functionality.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the robot primarily colored in gray and white with orange accent markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the robot with a predominant color scheme of gray and white, which is typical for mechanical entities, providing a neutral base or camouflage. The orange accents, such as on wing tips, thruster nozzles, and other components, add a vibrant highlight, common in design to attract attention or indicate features.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the robot posed with one leg bent forward and the other extended backward, suggesting forward motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot is displayed in a stationary position within its packaging, showing it standing with both legs straight. The posture doesn't indicate motion, as designs of such products often prioritize the security and balance of the figure within the box over dynamic poses.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a box design that doesn't include any copyright text in the bottom-left corner or elsewhere on the visible portion, aligning more with branding for sale rather than display of ownership or design credits.",
