      "question": "Are the eyes of the figure still bright blue with clearly visible irises?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is depicted as a chibi-style character encased in a snow globe. This style usually emphasizes a cartoon-like, simplified form, and the facial features are obscured, with a focus on the overall shape rather than specific details like eyes. As a result, no bright blue eyes or visible irises are apparent. This differs significantly from Image A, where the figure has discernible facial features including bright blue eyes with visible irises. Thus, the eyes are not a prominent feature in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the facial texture still characterized by deep, horizontal and vertical wrinkles and a cracked, stone-like pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure has a smooth and simplified design characteristic of a chibi figurine within a snow globe, lacking detailed textures and intricate facial features like wrinkles or a stone-like appearance. Comparatively, in Image A, the figure's face is defined by deep wrinkles and a cracked, stone-like texture, giving it a detailed and aged appearance. The transformation to a cartoon representation inherently loses these specific textural details.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the figure still shown with long, white hair extending past the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the cartoonish and stylized depiction of the figure, it retains the feature of long white hair flowing past the shoulders, conforming to the simplified and exaggerated chibi art style. This is consistent with Image A, where the figure also exhibits long, white hair. Therefore, the hair length and color remain unchanged across both images.",

      "question": "Does the figure still have a full, white beard covering the lower face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style representation of the figure does not include a full, white beard. The focus is more on the shape and overall appearance, consistent with cartoon or figurine representations where intricate features like beards may not be emphasized. In contrast, Image A clearly shows a full, white beard, which adds to the detailed and realistic nature of the portrayal. The absence of a beard in the cartoonish Image B indicates a simplification of facial features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the facial contours, including the jawline and cheekbones, still clearly defined and consistent with the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's facial contours are simplified due to the chibi style, which often smooths out and minimizes pronounced physical features such as the jawline and cheekbones. Image A presents a strong, defined facial structure with clear details, contrasting sharply with the edited image's simplified representation. Therefore, the detailed contours from Image A are not present in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the neck still visibly defined and structured, showing a clear transition from head to torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, as a chibi representation within a snow globe, typically emphasizes a unified head-to-body style without a detailed neck or structured transition, characteristic of the style's simplified body form. In Image A, the original figure displays a clear neck structure, visible with defined transitions between the head and the torso. The simplified nature of Image B results in the loss of a distinct neck.",
