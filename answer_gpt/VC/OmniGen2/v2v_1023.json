      "question": "Are the four individuals still seated together in the same relative positions inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts four chibi-style characters inside a snow globe. They are positioned closely, resembling the original group arrangement in Image A. The visual cue of the characters' close proximity and facing the same direction as in Image A indicates that they are maintaining the same relative positions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the chibi-style characters retain identifiable facial features and clothing styles of the original individuals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi-style art often simplifies and exaggerates features, making detailed facial features less identifiable. While Image B retains the overall clothing style colors (such as the light and dark tops shown), it does not showcase specific facial features due to the chibi art style.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the characters still holding game controllers in their hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style characters are depicted holding objects that resemble game controllers, consistent with those seen in Image A. Despite the chibi style simplifying shapes, the presence of these objects aligns with their function as game controllers.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's characters are dressed in a manner consistent with casual wear, with similar color patterns seen in Image A. The depiction of the chibi characters with colors mirroring the clothing from Image A implies a retention of the casual style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the characters as chibi figurines on a snow-like surface within a globe, without elements that resemble a couch or similar seating like in Image A.",
