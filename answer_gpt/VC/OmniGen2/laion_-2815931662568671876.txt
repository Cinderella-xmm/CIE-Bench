    "Question": "Q1: Is the coarse, slightly cracked texture of the largest tortilla chip retained, including visible salt crystals?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the tortilla chip is replaced with a cartoonish guacamole character, and no tortilla chip is visible with its original coarse, slightly cracked texture or salt crystals. Given the cartoon nature of the image, no realistic textures or salt crystals are present.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the golden-brown color of the largest tortilla chip preserved, with natural tonal variation?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a cartoonish guacamole character rather than any tortilla chips, so the golden-brown color and natural tonal variation seen in realistic tortilla chips are not present in this context.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the chunky, uneven texture of the guacamole mound preserved, showing visible avocado pieces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of guacamole is highly stylized as a cartoon character, which lacks the chunky, uneven texture and visible avocado pieces typical of real guacamole. The guacamole appears smooth and has a distinct face, not highlighting the texture meant for real avocado.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the green-yellow gradient of the guacamole preserved, showing natural avocado color variation?",
    "explanation": "The guacamole depicted in Image B is stylized and has a uniform bright green color, typical of cartoon illustrations, without the natural green-yellow gradient and color variations that real avocado typically exhibits.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the chip and guacamole rendered with realistic material properties, avoiding glossy or plastic-like finishes?",
    "explanation": "Image B represents the guacamole as a cartoon character, which inherently carries a glossy and non-realistic, plastic-like finish typical of illustrations. Thus, the realistic material properties are not maintained, as seen in the smooth, shiny cartoon representation.",
    "answer": "No"
