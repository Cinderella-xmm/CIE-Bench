      "question": "Is the flag positioned at the top of the tallest central spire of the sandcastle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) depicts a sandcastle encased in a glass dome with a label 'Empire of the Shores'. There is no visible flag on the tallest central spire or any part of the sandcastle within the dome. The presence of a flag is not evident in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there two spiral staircases symmetrically positioned on either side of the central entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandcastle inside the glass dome has a central entrance with staircases leading up to it. However, these staircases are straight, not spiral, and there's one staircase visible symmetrically positioned on either side. Therefore, there aren't two spiral staircases in this setup.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a central arched doorway with ornate latticework directly above it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a central arched doorway in the sandcastle, but there is no ornate latticework directly above it. The sandcastle design is relatively smooth without intricate decorative latticework above the entrance.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there at least seven conical turrets visible around the perimeter of the sandcastle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the sandcastle within a glass dome with multiple conical turrets. There are several visible around the structure, but upon close examination, the count does not reach seven distinct conical turrets visible around the perimeter in the edited image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Are starfish and seashells visibly present around the base of the sandcastle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the sandcastle under a glass dome positioned on a wooden base. There are seashells visible on the sand within the dome, but no starfish are present. Thus, the presence of seashells is confirmed without starfish.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the sandcastle designed with bilateral symmetry along its central vertical axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) presents a sandcastle within a glass dome, with symmetrical features noticeable around the central axis, including turrets and staircases. The design is balanced and symmetrical along its central vertical axis.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there decorative carvings visible on the surfaces of the towers and archways?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandcastle is visually smooth and simple without intricately detailed carvings on the towers and archways. The design is relatively plain without decorative carvings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a sandcastle inside the glass dome where the tallest tower is indeed centrally located, in keeping with common architectural designs where central towers are typically tallest. The central positioning reflects typical castle design logic.",
