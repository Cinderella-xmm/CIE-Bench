    "Question": "Q1: Are the black stripes evenly distributed across the body, head, and legs in the same pattern as the original knitted animal?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture has orange and black stripes with a glossy tiled appearance, creating a more geometric pattern, but still with even distribution across the body, head, and legs. In Image A, the knitted animal also has evenly distributed stripes, but the texture is different due to the knitted fabric. The pattern of stripes in the edited sculpture remains consistent in distribution across the body, head, and legs, similar to the original, but differs in the material and presentation.",
