}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the body of the eagle primarily dark brown?",
    "explanation": "The eagle represented in Image B has a body that is primarily dark brown, consistent with the typical coloring of a bald eagle. The darker body helps camouflage the bird against the forested backgrounds common to its habitat. This coloring is accurately shown in the model.",

    "Question": "Q5: Are the wings fully extended upward and outward in a soaring pose?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the eagle with its wings extended upward and outward in a pose that suggests soaring or gliding, a common sight for bald eagles, which often glide with wings spread broadly to cover large distances or survey territory. The model captures this behavior well.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the eagle have a visible yellow eye?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the eagle's eye is not visibly yellow; instead, the detail is simplified in the model. Although bald eagles have a characteristic yellow eye, the simplified representation in the model does not explicitly show this feature.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do the wings show layered feather patterns with darker tips and lighter bases?",
    "explanation": "The eagle wings in Image B appear to lack detailed layered feather patterns. The wings are simplified in design without stark contrasts between feather bases and tips, compared to the detailed feathering seen in Image A. The representation in the model does not focus on feather pattern intricacy.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Is the overall silhouette of the eagle consistent with a bald eagle in mid-flight?",
    "explanation": "The silhouette of the eagle in Image B is consistent with a bald eagle in mid-flight, featuring the characteristic white head and tail, dark brown body, and spread wings typical of a bald eagle's flight posture. The model preserves the iconic features that define the silhouette of the bald eagle.",
    "answer": "Yes"
