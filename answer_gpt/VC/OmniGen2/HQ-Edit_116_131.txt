    "Question": "Q1: Are the woman’s eyes clearly visible with almond-shaped pupils and defined eyeliner?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible face, and consequently, no visible eyes. Without visible eyes, we cannot determine if they are almond-shaped or if eyeliner is present. As there is no evidence to support the description of almond-shaped pupils with defined eyeliner, the answer has to be based on the information available solely in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the earrings consist of long, golden tassels hanging from the earlobes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, mannequins do not display earrings as these are clothing-only models. The absence of figures with ears or earrings means there is no visual information to confirm the presence of long, golden tassel earrings.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a high-standing mandarin collar with blue trim around the neck?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows several outfits on mannequins. One dress matches the description: it is red with a mandarin collar and blue trim. The other mannequins feature different designs without the described collar style, allowing us to confirm that such a collar exists on one outfit.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the hair styled in an updo with two loose strands falling on either side of the face?",

}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the main fabric of the qipao red in color?",

    "Question": "Q7: Is the woman’s right hand positioned near her chest, fingers slightly curled?",
