    "Question": "Q1: Is the stapler's primary color blue in both the front and rear views?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the front view of the stapler shows it in a bright blue color, while the rear view displays the stapler in a solid orange color. This mismatch indicates that the primary color is not consistently blue in both views. The analysis involves noting the distinct hue differences and understanding the general concept of 'primary color' as the dominant color on an object.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the metallic hinge appear on the stapler in both the front and rear views?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the front stapler view shows a metallic hinge, providing structural support and allowing the stapler to open. However, the rear view of the stapler does not exhibit any metallic hinge or similar mechanical components. By recognizing the typical configuration of staplers and observing the visual cues, the answer is derived.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the stapling slot visible in the front view of the stapler?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the front view clearly shows a typical opening or slot where staples are ejected to bind papers. This is a recognizable feature of a stapler. A good understanding of stapler mechanics assists in further affirming that this portion is indeed visible.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a light blue strip visible on the top surface of the stapler in both views?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the front view of the stapler displays a light blue strip on its top surface, noticeable due to contrasting light reflections. However, the rear view does not show any strip or similar feature on the top, instead displaying a uniform orange surface. The observation relies on recognizing the presence and absence of distinct design elements across different perspectives.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the background uniformly green in both the front and rear views?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a green background in the front view of the stapler, while the rear view distinctly features an orange background. The analysis involves understanding the concept of uniformity in color and observing how it applies accordingly.",
    "answer": "No"
