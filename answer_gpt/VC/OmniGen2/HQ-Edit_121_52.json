        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut's helmet visor appears to be a clear circular shape allowing visibility into the helmet, which would allow the face to be seen. This is aligned with typical design for helmets in space suits, allowing astronauts to see and be seen clearly.",
