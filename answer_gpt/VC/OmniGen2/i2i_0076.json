      "question": "Is the beige sofa present with its original cushion arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a beige sofa with several cushions on it. The visual clues here are the arrangement and color of the cushions. Without reference to Image A initially, we observe a consistent pattern and size of the cushions as we might expect on a typical sofa in a similar setting. To compare, Image A also shows the same sofa with what appears to be an identical cushion arrangement. There is no visible change in the number or placement of cushions between the two images, suggesting the cushion arrangement remains as originally configured.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a painting above the sofa showcasing mountain silhouettes and tree outlines, along with the words 'warm' across it. Despite the added text, the original artistic elements like the silhouettes of mountains and outlines of trees maintain clarity and are visually consistent. Comparing with Image A, where the painting lacks any text but also highlights the mountain and tree outlines, the main features remain unchanged in Image B, aside from the prominent text.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a potted plant with long green leaves positioned to the right of the sofa. This contributes to the room's aesthetic by adding a natural element. In comparing with Image A, the same plant is in the same position, indicating that this element was not altered or removed in the edit.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a woven rug that can be seen extending from beneath the beige sofa. This suggests the positioning of the rug under the sofa remains unchanged, adding texture and warmth to the room's design. In the comparison to Image A, the same woven rug is visible in a similar placement beneath the sofa, indicating no changes in its position.",
