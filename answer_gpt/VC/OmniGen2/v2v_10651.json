      "question": "Is the diamond-cut pattern on the decanter preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the decanter retains its diamond-cut pattern, which is evident from the geometric, criss-cross design visible on its surface, similar to common patterns seen on glassware that are designed to catch and refract light. This indicates preservation of this detail from Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the white foam layer present on top of the liquid in the glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass shows a foam layer on top of the liquid. This is identified by a slightly raised, textured surface on the liquid, which commonly signifies foam, such as that seen on beer. Image A confirms the presence of this foam layer, which was accurately preserved in the edit.",

      "question": "Are visible flames and glowing embers present in the fireplace in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly depicts flames and glowing embers with a warm, orange hue emanating from the fireplace, mimicking the appearance of a real fire, which suggests a realistic touch similar to Image A wherein flames are also visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bottle opener shaped with a D-shaped opening and a long handle, matching its original form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle opener retains the D-shaped opening and long handle configuration, typical of bottle openers, allowing it to hook onto bottle caps easily. Image A confirms this shape, and the edit does maintain this design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the decanter positioned to the right of the glass, with the opener placed in front of both?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spatial arrangement shows the decanter to the right of the glass, similar to a typical table setup to keep related objects close. The bottle opener is positioned in front of both, matching Image A's arrangement, indicating consistency in positioning.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the wooden table surface with visible grain texture present beneath the objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks a detailed grain texture typically seen on wooden surfaces. Instead, a simplified flat representation of wood color is present. This differs from Image A, where the wood's grain was visible, indicating this detail was not preserved in the edit.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the liquid level in the glass approximately near the rim, and in the decanter about halfway up?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the liquid level in the glass appears near the rim, and the liquid in the decanter is roughly at the halfway mark, similar to realistic serving pours. Comparing with Image A, both images show this consistency, affirming the positions are preserved.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
