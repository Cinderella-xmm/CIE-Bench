    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the atomic design retain the three intersecting elliptical orbits with a central nucleus and three electron positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the atomic design features an illustration in the center with elliptical shapes but there are no clear intersecting elliptical orbits with electron positions visible. Instead, it is more a stylized simplified version without specific electron positions. World knowledge about atomic models suggests the classic 'Rutherford-Bohr' model with distinct electron paths, which is not the case here visually.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the white plastic cookie cutter retaining its original atomic-shaped outline with three elliptical loops and a central nucleus?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B seems to focus on a thematic representation rather than showing the actual cookie cutter from Image A. There is no white plastic cookie cutter visible, showing three elliptical loops and a central nucleus like in an atomic shape, which is a deviation from a detailed atomic cookie cutter design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cookie cutter positioned to the left of the atomic imprint, with a partial edge overlap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a poster-like image and does not depict an actual process of using a cookie cutter, which Image A does. There is no showing of a cookie cutter positioned to the left of an atomic imprint with any overlap, suggesting a completely different setup.",
      "weight": 2,

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the atomic imprint in the dough have clean, continuous edges without breaks or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there isn't a depiction of dough with an atomic imprint like in Image A. The focus is on visual and thematic representation, not on an actual dough imprint, so we can't assess the cleanliness or continuity of edges of any imprinted dough.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a small central hole in the nucleus area of the atomic imprint?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show a detailed atomic imprint on dough as Image A does, where a small hole might be present in the actual dough imprint. It shows stylized design elements, but not the central hole in an imprint context.",
