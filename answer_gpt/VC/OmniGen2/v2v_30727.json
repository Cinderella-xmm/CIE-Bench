      "question": "Does the zebra retain its black and white stripe pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripe pattern remains consistent with the typical black and white stripes characteristic of zebras. These stripes cover the zebra uniformly from its head to its tail, with no alterations or disruptions visible. By combining visual information and world knowledge about the typical appearance of zebras, we can conclude that the zebra in the edited image maintains this pattern.",

      "question": "Is the zebra's body structure, including its legs and torso, intact?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the zebra appears to have a complete and coherent body structure. The legs and torso of the zebra exhibit natural morphology, consistent with a typical zebra observed in the wild. There is no indication of alteration or distortion in these elements when combining visual cues with knowledge of animal anatomy.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the watering hole still present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watering hole is visible in front of the zebra, consistent with its depiction as a water source for animals in natural settings. This feature's continuation can be inferred from the visual depiction of a reflective water surface in the sandy environment.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene includes the presence of rocks and a dry earth background that frames the zebra and the watering hole. This environment is typical for a setting in which zebras would naturally be found, and these elements are visible without contradiction or obfuscation.",

        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the zebra's tail appears to maintain its natural shape and remains positioned in a typical manner for a zebra, hanging down naturally. There is no sign of manipulation or repositioning evident.",
