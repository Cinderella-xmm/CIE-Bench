    "Question": "Q2: Does the woman wear a red dress with a V-neck and a high slit on the left leg?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is wearing a red dress that features a V-neck, which is visible due to its triangular neckline that dips down. However, there is no indication of a high slit on the dress; it appears to be uniformly flared without any visibly high cut on the left leg. This is different from what we observe in Image A, where the dress clearly has a high slit. Therefore, we conclude based on Image B and common dress styles.",
