    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the cabinâ€™s roof clearly shaped as an A-frame with snow covering its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we can see the cabin's roof is steeply pitched and triangular, resembling an A-frame structure, a common architectural style for cabins. The roof is clearly covered in snow, which is easily discernible by the white blanket on top. This observation aligns with the typical snow coverage found in winter scenes, supported by the overall snowy environment depicted in the image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a chimney located at the peak of the roof, from which smoke is rising?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chimney is positioned at the peak of the A-frame roof, indicative of maximizing air flow and ensuring proper dispersion of smoke, a practical consideration. Smoke can be visually seen emanating from the chimney, rising upward, which is characteristic of a chimney releasing exhaust from a fireplace or wood stove.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there exactly three illuminated windows on the upper level and three on the lower level, including one central window on the ground floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's a distinct presence of two illuminated windows on the upper level and two on the lower level. The window arrangement does not align with three windows on each level or a singular central window on the ground floor. This is inferred from the placement and the quantity of visible windows in the image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the walls of the cabin constructed from visible horizontal logs with chinking between them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts cabin walls built from horizontal logs, typical of log cabin construction. Although the image is stylized, there are noticeable horizontal lines suggesting logs stacked upon each other, which may have chinking between them, a common method to fill gaps for insulation in traditional log cabins.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there tall, snow-covered evergreen fir trees surrounding the cabin on all sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows tall trees around the cabin, giving the sense of a wooded, secluded area. While they resemble evergreen fir trees and are largely covered in snow, which is characteristic of a wintry scene, the cabin is surrounded almost completely, indicating a forest setting.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there smoke visibly rising vertically from the chimney into the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays smoke rising from the chimney, following a path upward into the sky, consistent with the natural behavior of smoke in cold air due to temperature differences between the inside and the outside air. The depiction of smoke moving vertically suggests that it is dispersing efficiently into the atmosphere.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there glowing string lights running along the edge of the roofline beneath the eaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible string lights following the eaves or the roofline edges. Despite some warm illumination, the characteristics of string lights, like those used for decorative purposes during festive periods, are absent in the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there small snow-covered shrubs positioned on either side of the front porch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases small shrubs covered in snow on both sides of the front porch, which is common in stylized winter scenes for adding to the overall aesthetic. These shrubs are discernible by their shape and proximity to the entrance of the cabin, enhancing the portrayal of a cozy, wintry cabin setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Is there a split-rail fence partially buried in snow in the foreground, extending to the left and right of the cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display a split-rail fence in the foreground which would typically be a rustic wooden structure running across the landscape. The absence of such an element is apparent when analyzing the area in front of and surrounding the cabin.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q10",
      "question": "Are there visible snowflakes falling throughout the scene, particularly in the sky and around the cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features visible snowflakes scattered through the entire scene, contributing to the snowy ambiance. This depiction captures the dynamic sense of snowfall, drifting down upon the cabin and landscape, which is a traditional representative of a winter setting.",
