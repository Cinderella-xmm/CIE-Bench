    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the bright red flowers in the lower-left foreground still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a floral structure visible, but its prominent bright red color seen in Image A is absent. The edited image features vivid blue elements that dominate the scene, suggesting the original red flowers are not visually present in their previous form.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the large green leaf in the bottom-right corner still visible and in the same position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dominant bright blue hues and ethereal shapes overshadow the presence of the original green leaf seen in the bottom-right corner of Image A. Therefore, the original positioning and visibility are altered.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the palm-like fronds with fan-shaped leaves visible on the right side of the waterfall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases an edited environment emphasizing a mythical figure and ethereal design elements rather than natural vegetation. The palm-like fronds with fan-shaped leaves are replaced or obscured by digital effects, suggesting their absence.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the moss-covered rock formation visible at the top of the waterfallâ€™s origin point?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a highly stylized, otherworldly scene that seems to replace natural textures, such as moss-covered rocks, with digital effects that contribute to a fantasy feel. The rocks are visually altered, suggesting significant editing.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the dense tropical vegetation on both sides of the waterfall still present and forming a natural frame around the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B swaps dense tropical vegetation from Image A with surreal landscape features, dramatically changing the original frame created by natural vegetation. The digital representation focuses on a mythical ambiance rather than natural framing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the pool area at the base of the waterfall still located in the same position, even if its appearance has changed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the pool area in Image A represents a natural water body for the waterfall, Image B introduces a mystical basin or bowl, yet remains in the same lower part of the scene that corresponds to the pool's original position.",
