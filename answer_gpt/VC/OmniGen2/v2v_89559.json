      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the logo on the left clearly shows the text 'SEARCH FOR A STAR', which is similar in style and format to the logo on Image A. The text is prominently displayed in a bold blue font with a yellow star, making it immediately recognizable.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right logo contains the text 'RISING STAR' in a bold format with a star. This layout is seen as part of a branding style similar to Image A, supporting its presence.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, below the 'RISING STAR' text and adjacent to the logo is the text 'SUMO DIGITAL'. It's structured in a specific font and placement matching the theme seen in Image A, indicating the affiliation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's no visible 'Character Art Directory 2018' text. Instead, text at the bottom part of the 'SEARCH FOR A STAR' logo reads 'SUMO 2018 Charactery 2018'. This suggests that the original phrase is not present in the same form.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given that Image B does not contain the text 'Character Art Directory 2018', it cannot be centrally aligned. Instead, other elements occupy the space.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks the text 'Character Art Directory 2018', so there's no text position relation to evaluate. However, it's irrelevant as both logos appear above the wooden plaque with 'SUMO 2018'.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Sumo Digital' logo is directly beneath the 'RISING STAR' text. This placement mirrors what would conventionally be expected for brand logos, consistent with its positioning in Image A.",
