      "question": "Is the background composed of flowing, curved lines made of multicolored bokeh lights in red, orange, blue, purple, and teal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background does feature flowing, curved lines in bokeh light style with multicolors present including red, orange, blue, purple, and teal. These visual elements are similar to the effects created by out-of-focus lighting, commonly referred to as bokeh, frequently found in backgrounds to add a vibrant and dynamic effect.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the beige coat retain a visible woolen texture with detailed folds and surface variation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the coat appears to have a smoother, more stylized texture, reflecting a digitally rendered or painted finish rather than a true woolen texture with detailed folds and surface variations. This suggests a lack of realistic fabric texture.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the dark scarf adorned with a visible, subtle patterned texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the scarf does show a noticeable pattern, indicating attention to detail typical in a highly stylized or digital artwork, which maintains some form of subtle patterned texture in its design.",

      "question": "Are the gold-rimmed aviator sunglasses positioned over the eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunglasses, with their gold rims, are indeed positioned correctly as typical aviator sunglasses would be, although we can't see the eyes due to the blurred face, the placement is consistent with such positioning.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the subject have silver-gray, wavy hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depicted hair appears to have a distinctly wavy style. However, the digital rendering style makes it lean more towards a light blond or platinum look rather than a pure silver-gray tone. The wavy character is retained, but the color may differ slightly.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows two prominent black buttons on the front of the coat, accurately reflecting the button placement you would expect in such a coat style.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the scarf positioned under the coat collar, creating a layered effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scarf is visibly tucked under the coat collar, contributing to a layered appearance where the scarf and coat intersect. This is consistent with common sartorial layering techniques.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a coat with lapels and a collar that possess a structured and angular design, complete with sharply defined edges, all characteristic of a tailored and stylized representation.",
