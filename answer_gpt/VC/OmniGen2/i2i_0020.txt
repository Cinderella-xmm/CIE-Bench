    "Question": "Q1: Is the train represented in a red-and-gray color block scheme?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the train is not depicted as an actual train but rather as a single gray line with a red hexagon representing a stop sign. This minimalist depiction lacks any train details, so there are no color schemes present to identify a train in red-and-gray colors. Therefore, the presence of colored blocks to represent a train doesn't exist in this minimalist conceptual representation.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the sign circular with the text 'STOP' clearly displayed?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stop sign is not circular but hexagonal in shape. The text 'STOP' is clearly displayed on this red hexagon. Typically, stop signs in many places are hexagonal (octagonal) and not circular, aligning with conventional stop sign designs.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the train positioned parallel to the tracks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no literal representation of a train; instead, there is a simplified drawing with a gray line that can interpretatively serve as a railroad track. As there are no specific parallel lines with a detailed train depiction, the question of whether a train is parallel cannot be logically answered based on this abstract depiction.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there green mountain outlines in the background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a simplistic green polygon that resembles the outline of mountains positioned above the gray line and away from the stop sign, emulating a background silhouette often seen in scenic depictions involving mountains.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are simplified track lines present beneath the train?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a single gray line extending horizontally across the image. This line can be interpreted as a simplistic representation of a railroad track due to its straight horizontal positioning that aligns conceptually with how tracks run parallel to ground surfaces beneath trains in real scenarios.",
    "answer": "Yes"
