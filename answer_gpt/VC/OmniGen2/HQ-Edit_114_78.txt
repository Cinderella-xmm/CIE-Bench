    "Question": "Q1: Is the ornate bow with symmetrical scrollwork and central fleur-de-lis motif present and accurately rendered?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases a key within a box, but the emphasis is on the miniature village scene rather than a detailed depiction of the key's design. The ornate bow is missing, and rather, the key is simplified to just a regular key shape without noticeable embellishments or intricate motifs. This suggests that the ornate bow with symmetrical scrollwork and a fleur-de-lis motif is not a part of Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Is the distinctive cutout pattern of the key bit, resembling a cross or puzzle piece, preserved?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the key bit is visible and retains a simple rectangular cutout rather than a complex or distinctive cross-like or puzzle shape. The key focuses on form rather than overly detailed cutout shapes, thus the distinctive pattern mentioned is not preserved.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the segmented fluted ridges along the shaft of the key retained?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the key appears quite standard in terms of its design; it does not feature segmented fluted ridges along the shaft like Image A. The attention here is on the miniature scene rather than key details. Consequently, the fluted ridges are not retained or highlighted.",

    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the vertical wood grain texture present in the background or hill surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background prominently displays a wood grain texture, indicating vertical patterns or lines similar to Image A's background. While Image B transitions focus to the scene within the box, the vertical wood grain is apparent.",

    "Question": "Q7: Is a visible shadow cast beneath the key, indicating its three-dimensional form and placement?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a key laying flat with a slight 3D effect due to the lighting and shadowing. However, it focuses on the miniature village scene, and any notable shadow cast beneath the key is minimal and not specifically emphasized.",
