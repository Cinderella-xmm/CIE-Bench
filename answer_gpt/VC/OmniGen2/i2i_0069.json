      "question": "Is the sandwich's crust depicted as having a golden-brown, crusty texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandwich displays a crust with a rich brown hue, which implies a baked and crusty surface typical of a toasted sandwich. The golden-brown color is characteristic of the Maillard reaction during baking, resulting in a crusty texture which adds to the appearance of a well-prepared sandwich.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows various layers within the sandwich, including slices of red, which are likely tomatoes, green elements resembling lettuce, and hints of white or light yellow, suggesting cheese. These layers are commonly found in sandwiches to add flavor and texture.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knife is placed on the parchment paper, directly adjacent to the sandwich, and runs parallel to the length of the sandwich. This arrangement is typical for convenience during cutting or serving.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, there doesn't appear to be a distinct tablecloth pattern visible. The surface under the parchment paper lacks intricate designs and seems more like a blurred or indistinct surface, likely result from the focus on foreground elements.",
