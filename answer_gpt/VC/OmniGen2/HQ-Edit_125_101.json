      "question": "Is the dancer depicted in an arabesque leap with one leg extended behind and arms forming a diagonal line?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is captured in an aerial pose inside a snow globe, with one leg extended to the side and arms raised, creating an elegant line. This is not a typical arabesque leap, as an arabesque usually involves one leg extended straight behind the dancer's body and arms forming a diagonal line. The pose in Image B, however, appears more like a grand jeté or a similar ballet leap. Based on ballet terminology and this visual assessment, the dancer is not in an arabesque leap.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the Eiffel Tower retain its characteristic iron lattice structure and three-tiered design with a spire at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows three miniature Eiffel Towers placed inside a snow globe. The central Eiffel Tower is depicted with its distinct lattice structure, a three-tiered design, and topped with the iconic spire. These features are clearly maintained, as they are key characteristics of the Eiffel Tower's architectural design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are both feet of the dancer wearing pointe shoes with visible ribbons and box-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer within the snow globe is wearing pointe shoes. These shoes are characterized by the box-like structure at the tip, and though the ribbons are not distinctly visible in this image, the shape suggests pointe shoes, which are typically secured with ribbons. Combining this visual with common ballet knowledge confirms the presence of pointe shoes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the dancer’s head turned to face the Eiffel Tower, indicating forward gaze toward it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is facing forward with a profile view shown, but the direction of the face does not align directly with the Eiffel Tower. Instead, the dancer's head seems directed more towards the observer or straight ahead, given the position inside the snow globe. Therefore, the head is not specifically turned toward the Eiffel Tower.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the dancer wearing a leotard that is predominantly turquoise in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dancer in Image B is dressed in what appears to be a leotard inside the snow globe. The attire is shown in a turquoise hue, consistent with descriptions and depictions of turquoise attire. This analysis is supported by the visible color tone presented.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the dancer positioned in the foreground, clearly in front of the Eiffel Tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is inside a snow globe, positioned such that the Eiffel Tower is situated slightly behind the dancer visually. The visual composition places the dancer at a closer perspective within the sphere, indicating a foreground position relative to the tower.",
