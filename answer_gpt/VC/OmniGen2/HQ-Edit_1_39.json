      "question": "Is the rectangular wooden window frame with stone pillars on both sides present and unaltered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no rectangular wooden window frame visible, nor are there stone pillars on either side. Instead, the image features a creature standing in a desert landscape with no indication of a window frame. This suggests the absence of such elements in the edited image.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the distant mountains and multiple upright cacti visible in the background beyond the window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background shows a desert landscape with mountains and multiple upright cacti, supporting the perception of a typical desert environment. These elements are observable without the presence of a window framing them. Thus, this observation remains accurate to Image B's depiction.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the shadow of the pot cast to the left on the wooden sill, indicating sunlight from the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a pot or a wooden windowsill with shadows indicative of sunlight direction. Instead, it shows a creature in an open desert setting, making the context of shadows on a sill inapplicable.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sky above the desert a clear blue with scattered white clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B is indeed a clear blue with scattered white clouds, which fits the typical depiction of a bright, sunny desert day. This environmental feature is common and observable in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the windowsill made of weathered wooden planks with visible grain and cracks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show a windowsill at all; it depicts a creature standing in a desert. Therefore, there are no wooden planks or windowsills visible, making this description not applicable to the edited image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the transformed creature positioned centrally within the window frame, on the windowsill?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a creature standing centrally in the desert landscape and not within a window frame or on a windowsill. The absence of any window structure in the image indicates no such positioning.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the ground beyond the window a flat, arid desert terrain with sparse dry grass and shrubs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground portrayal is of an arid desert terrain, which includes sparse dry grass and shrubs, typical for such environments. Although not seen through a window, the landscape corresponds with this description, matching the desert scene present in the image.",
