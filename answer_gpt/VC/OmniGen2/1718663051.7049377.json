      "question": "Is there exactly one tree positioned in the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central object is a single tree that is prominently positioned in the middle. The shapes and structure indicate that it is the main focus of the scene. There are no other distinct trees shown, hence the conclusion that there is exactly one tree.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the tree have a clearly defined layered canopy structure with multiple horizontal tiers of foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tree in Image B exhibits a structure with foliage arranged in apparent horizontal layers or tiers that form a canopy. This multi-tiered structure is visually evident, with distinct separation between the levels.",

      "question": "Is the tree positioned in front of the mountain range in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree is depicted as being in the foreground, with the mountains appearing behind it. This positioning creates a depth effect, with the tree in front of the mountainous landscape.",

    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible shadow extending from the base of the tree, as the image style is akin to stained glass artwork, which typically uses strong outlines without depicting shadows.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ground area in Image B appears to be a plain with a grassy texture beneath the tree, depicted in a stylized form typical of stained glass art, suggesting a flat and open landscape area.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there mountains visible in the background behind the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B includes stylized mountainous shapes indicating the presence of mountains, helping to establish the scene as nature-based with a mountainous setting behind the tree.",
