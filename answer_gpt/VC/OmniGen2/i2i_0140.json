      "question": "Does the quilt pattern retain its distinct pink, green, and white geometric and floral motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quilt pattern presents geometric shapes filled with different colors, including red, green, and yellow. The motifs appear less distinct in terms of flower patterns as compared to Image A. The quilt design and color scheme deviate from the pink, green, and white observed initially. This alteration suggests changes to the motif details and the color palette differs, so the distinct pink and floral motifs are not retained.",

      "question": "Are the two beds still placed parallel, with the nightstand positioned centrally between them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual cues show two beds placed alongside each other with a small table in the center, indicating parallel positioning and central placement of the nightstand. Without referring to Image A, this arrangement gives the impression that both elements are positioned as before. Comparing Image B to Image A confirms that the layout remains unchanged in terms of bed parallel placement and nightstand central position.",

      "question": "Do the two framed wall art pieces remain above the respective beds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two frames above each bed, depicting human figures. This indicates the presence of wall art above the beds, akin to Image A which features framed art pieces in similar positions. Comparing both images shows no change in the placement and number of wall art pieces over the beds.",

      "question": "Does the left bed retain the magenta decorative pillow and the right bed retain the teal decorative pillow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the left bed with a red pillow and the right bed with a blue pillow. Using common knowledge of color recognition, we can identify the variation in pillow shades. Comparing to Image A, the magenta and teal colors are distinct from the red and blue seen in Image B, indicating a change in decorative pillow colors.",

      "question": "Is there still a small white nightstand between the beds with a vase containing a pink flower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a small table is visible between the beds supporting a vase with a pink flower. Without referring to Image A, these visual elements suggest the presence of a nightstand and floral decor located centrally. Image A's similar configuration confirms that these elements are consistently placed across both images.",
