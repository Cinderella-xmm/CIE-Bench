      "question": "Is the tower visibly leaning to the right, maintaining its characteristic tilt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower exhibits a noticeable tilt towards the right, which aligns with the well-known characteristic of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. This slant is a prominent feature of the structure, visible in photos as the tower leans from its base and becomes more pronounced towards the top. This observation is based on the clear visible slope, common in depictions of the tower.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the tower consists of different levels or tiers of arched arcades. Upon counting, there are eight distinct levels visible, each with evenly spaced arches. This is a typical feature of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, which is constructed with these distinct arched divisions.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of the tower in Image B, a flagpole is visible with a red flag waving. This is a common characteristic seen in images depicting the Leaning Tower of Pisa, where a flag often adorns the top of the structure, enhancing its historic and cultural significance.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, towards the base of the tower, there are visible decorative patterns that are diamond-shaped. These patterns are integrated into the stonework, which aligns with some historical architectural styles, adding ornamental detail to the structure's otherwise uniform facade.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the tower's facade with a characteristic marble texture, where the white and gray hues are evident. Between the levels, there are horizontal bands that demarcate each tier, which are commonly found in marble structures like the Leaning Tower of Pisa, highlighting its layered construction.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each level of the tower showcases slender columns that are evenly spaced around the perimeter. These columns function as supports for the arches above them, a typical architectural feature of the Pisa tower, adding to the overall historic aesthetic of the structure.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower is noticeably positioned more towards the right side of the image rather than being centered, presenting a composition choice that allows the background and the snowy foreground to balance the visual interest. This placement emphasizes the leaning feature and the expansive backdrop.",
