      "question": "Are the sausages rendered in a reddish-brown color consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sausages held by the figurines in the box appear to be reddish-brown, which is consistent with the typical color of grilled sausages. Analyzing Image A, the sausages being cooked over the fire also exhibit this reddish-brown hue, suggesting consistency in the color representation between the two images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the sausages display parallel dark grill marks along their length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sausages held by the figurines have visible parallel dark grill marks along their length, indicating they have been grilled. This detail is consistent with the characteristics of grilled sausages seen in Image A, where the sausages also show grill marks.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the sausages exhibit a glossy, reflective surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows sausages that have a glossy and reflective surface, suggesting they have been coated or are oily, which is typical for freshly grilled sausages. This characteristic is also evident in Image A, where the sausages reflect light, confirming the glossy appearance in both images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there exactly three sausages present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features four figurines, each holding a sausage, giving a total of four sausages. Image A shows three sausages on skewers above the fire. The count of sausages differs between the images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is each sausage attached to a metal skewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sausages are held by figurines and are not visibly attached to metal skewers. In contrast, Image A clearly shows each sausage skewered on a metal rod. Therefore, Image B does not meet this criterion.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the sausages show slight bulging at their ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sausages held by the figurines appear straight without noticeable bulging at the ends. In Image A, the sausages display a slight bulge at the ends, typically seen in cooked sausages. There is no indication of bulging in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there visible reflective highlights on the upper surfaces of the sausages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sausages in Image B show a shiny appearance, but specific reflective highlights on the upper surfaces are not clearly visible. In Image A, however, the sausages display definite reflective highlights, contributing to their glossy look. Reflective highlights are more discernible in Image A than in Image B.",
