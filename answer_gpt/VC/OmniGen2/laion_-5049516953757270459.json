      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the overall shape of the food arrangement a perfect heart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of objects appears in a heart-shaped wooden tray. Observing the contours and symmetry, the shape aligns well with a heart's typical rounded top and pointed bottom. Based on this analysis, Image B shows a heart shape that seems visually perfect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the avocado shown as half-cut with the pit cavity visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, an object resembling an avocado is placed, featuring a visible pit cavity and a smooth interior, which signifies it has been half-cut. Common knowledge tells us that an avocado's pit cavity is visible when sliced. Thus, the avocado in Image B appears half-cut with the pit cavity visible.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the asparagus stalks bundled together with a visible twine-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows bundles like yellow Lego bricks instead of asparagus. Common asparagus bundles typically feature stalks tied together with twine to maintain unity. However, these blocks in Image B do not show such a twine structure, representing more a loose assembly.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries grouped together at the top-left of the heart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, strawberries are apparent within the arrangement, but instead of blueberries and raspberries, there are blue and red Lego bricks observed. These objects are positioned towards the top-left of the heart, but not as real berries. Therefore, while similar items are grouped, they do not replicate the real berries' assembly.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a single red onion positioned near the broccoli and garlic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases objects resembling a red onion near broccoli and garlic. Common knowledge about typical red onion placement in similar assemblies draws attention to an onion-shaped purple sphere near green broccoli and a little circular object akin to garlic, supporting red onion proximity.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there at least three white mushrooms grouped together near the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are block-like objects in white color near the center of the arrangement. These objects resemble mushrooms but are not enough to indicate a proper grouping of actual mushrooms. The assembly features blocks instead, not detailing distinct groupings of three mushrooms.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a large red bell pepper at the bottom-right of the heart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, toward the bottom-right section, there's a long, curved red object which resembles bell pepper. Known shapes and colors of bell peppers suggest a large red curvature fitting the description of the bell pepper placement.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the background a neutral gray surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a distinctly smooth gray background surface surrounding the heart arrangement. Surfaces like these provide a neutral tone, and Image B's unmarked gray background is recognizable.",
