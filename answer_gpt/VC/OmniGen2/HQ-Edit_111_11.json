        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the face is blurred and specific features like wrinkles cannot be determined visually, world knowledge suggests that without explicit alteration, facial features should remain consistent. However, due to the blurring, we cannot confirm the presence of wrinkled facial features.",
