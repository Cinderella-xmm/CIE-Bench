      "question": "Is the clock face still white after the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face is visually assessed. It appears to have a plain design with a white background, indicating it remains unchanged in color. The clarity of the white against the black hands and the turquoise background reinforces the notion that the clock face is white.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both the hour and minute hands still black after the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the main hands of the clock, which indicate the hour and minute, are observed. Both hands are black, providing a stark contrast against the white face, suggesting no change in their color.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there still a red second hand on the clock after the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a thin hand that contrasts with the black hour and minute hands. This hand is a different color and appears to have a reddish hue, akin to the traditional coloring for second hands to distinguish them from others, indicating the presence of a red second hand.",

      "question": "Is the orange pivot point still present after the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the meeting point of the clock hands is colored orange, providing a visual focal point that remains consistent with typical clock designs where the pivot point is sometimes accentuated in color for aesthetic or functional differentiation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the clock face remain free of numbers or markings after the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face is scrutinized for any signs or numbers. Unlike in Image A where it was blank, Image B features minimal markings positioned at the cardinal points. These markings contribute to time-telling precision but mean the face is no longer entirely free of markings.",
      "weight": 2,
