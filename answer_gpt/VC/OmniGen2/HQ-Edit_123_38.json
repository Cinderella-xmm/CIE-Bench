        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a graphic design that appears to be printed and illustrated, rather than a realistic representation of a balance beam. There are no details such as wood texture, wear, or paint chipping; instead, it features a clean, abstract background with a smooth color transition.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gymnast’s pose is clear. She is in a handstand with her body arched backward and her legs lifted above her head, creating a classic gymnastic pose. This aligns with common knowledge on gymnastic positions.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible chalk marks on the balance beam beneath the gymnast’s hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the balance beam is depicted in an artistic style with abstract elements, lacking realistic details such as chalk marks. The surface beneath the gymnast’s hands does not feature these specific details.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the gymnast’s face turned sideways with her eyes looking downward toward the beam?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the face is blurred, the overall posture suggests that the gymnast's head orientation likely follows her body movement, which in this pose would suggest her head is aligned in such a way that she could be facing down towards the beam.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
