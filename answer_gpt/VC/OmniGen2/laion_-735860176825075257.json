      "question": "Are the black-and-white half-timbered gable ends visible and positioned at the top of the central and right-side sections of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual cues show that the building has black-and-white half-timbering in a gable end style prominently displayed at the top of the central and right-side sections of the building. This matches the architectural technique commonly used in half-timbered buildings. The gable ends are characterized by their triangular shape at the top of the building.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a black arched door situated on the left side of the building within a red-bricked wall. This follows the common design where arched doors are directly embedded within a wall, below window ledges or other architectural elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an awning over the entrance doors, but the sign does not read 'Leeds Parkway Hotel'. It appears to have different writing, indicating that the sign is not the same. Analysis shows the use of text in this region, but specific comparison with Image A reveals the differing text content.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are illustrations of plants at the base of the building as surrounding decorative objects, but they differ from Image A. They are not rectangular planters with colorful flowers, matching common placement decor in realistic architectural settings. The depiction is stylized in Image B, and they appear as outlined illustrative plants rather than specific planters.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows multiple windows with distinctive grid patterns and white frames, matching visually recognizable features commonly seen in buildings. However, the details do not include dormer windows on the roof or a bay window on the right side. Image A confirms these features, while Image B simplifies the design missing these architectural details.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a set of entrance doors positioned centrally under the awning, consistent with common building designs. However, the doors appear as a double set without glass panels, deviating from Image A's specification where the doors are described with glass panels.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B represents the lower section of the building in red brick, featuring an arched opening housing a black door. This is a typical architectural feature recognized in world knowledge. The depiction simplifies the realistic detailing but retains the essential characteristics seen in such designs, which align with Image A's architecture.",
