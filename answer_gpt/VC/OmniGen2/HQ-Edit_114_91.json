      "question": "Is the anvil’s pointed horn still present and positioned at the same end of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object that resembles an anvil has transformed into a stylized base where an owl figure with glowing elements is perched. The pointed horn end of the object is visually apparent on the right side of this setup, suggesting it retained the pointed feature. This analysis reflects a stylized continuation of the anvil's form.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the hammer retain a wooden handle connected to its head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no hammer present. The significant figure is the owl perched upon a structure resembling a tree stump, and no tool handles or traditional hammers are visible. The focal point is the owl and its vibrant elements, making it clear that a hammer, especially one with a wooden handle, is absent.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hammer resting diagonally across the anvil’s flat surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B only features the owl and its resting place, with no visible hammer. The central object is the owl and its ornate resting tree stump-like structure, thus negating the presence of a tool like a hammer on an anvil.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a multi-paned window with frosted glass visible on the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no window or building interior present in Image B. The scene is set outdoors in a forest-like environment. The absence of architectural elements such as windows implies that the setting is natural rather than a workshop.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are multiple metal tools mounted vertically on the greenish-gray wooden wall behind the anvil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting depicts a forest without any artificial or constructed background such as walls with tools. The focus is on natural elements, including trees and foliage, making any reference to vertically mounted metal tools invalid.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are green ivy leaves visible growing over the window frame and wrapping around the base of the anvil and hammer handle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although there is foliage present, it is part of the natural environment surrounding and decorating the owl figure. No window frame is present, and the foliage seems to be a part of and growing over the owl and its throne, not an anvil, as greenery is integrated into the owl's design. There is also no hammer to which ivy could be wrapping around a handle.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the anvil sitting on a wooden workbench showing signs of wear and dust accumulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B replaces a workbench setting with a nature-themed scene. The object resembling an anvil has morphed into the base that appears to be an organic tree stump. This surface shows signs of greenery and mystical elements rather than any wear, tear, or dust that would indicate an old workbench.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there visible roots and organic debris scattered on the surface of the workbench?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elevated foreground in Image B is stylized like a tree stump and is covered in greenery, suggesting vibrancy and growth rather than scattered debris. The focus on the organized aesthetic of plant life growing on and around the owl figure negates the presence of random organic debris.",
