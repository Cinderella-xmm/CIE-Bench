        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design does not include a central carved wooden panel with floral and scrollwork.

      "question": "Are the two large multi-paned windows positioned symmetrically on either side of the desk, with intact glass panes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any windows at all. It focuses solely on a fictional time travel apparatus set-up. In Image A, the large multi-paned windows positioned symmetrically around the desk are a key feature, providing natural lighting and a view. This element is absent from Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no drapes visible in Image B as the image features a different theme centered around machinery related to time travel. In Image A, the dark gray drapes are a prominent part of the decor tied back beside the windows. In Image B, there's a completely different background structure, leaving no room for the drapes.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on a central steampunk gadgetry and there's no leather armchair visible. In Image A, the armchair appears on the left foreground of the image. Image B's layout does not allow for any such furniture to be visible.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a Persian-style rug. Instead, it presents a steampunk-inspired theme. In Image A, the Persian-style rug is noticeable underneath the desk aiding in the aesthetics of the study room. The lack of such a rug in Image B reflects the thematic shift to a more industrial look.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no traditional computer monitor. The desk features older-looking equipment as part of a time-travel theme. Image A includes a modern computer with a silver stand and flat screen, which is entirely replaced by retro tech elements in Image B.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no windows or radiator feature exists, as the focus is on a complex time-travel setup. In Image A, a wooden radiator aligns with the baseboard beneath the left window, which contributes to the classic study aesthetic absent from Image B.",
