      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the three triangular windows positioned at the apex of the A-frame roof clearly present and maintaining their triangular shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure appears to be a geometric glass building rather than a traditional cabin with an A-frame roof and triangular windows. The roof structure does not support the presence of any windows, especially triangular ones at the apex of a roof. Based on this analysis, no triangular windows are visible or applicable to this structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the cabin structured with a raised deck on the upper level and a garage on the lower level, maintaining the same vertical separation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a geometrically stylized glass and crystal structure rather than a traditional cabin with multiple levels. There are no levels or traditional architectural elements such as a raised deck or a garage present in this image. Therefore, the elements of vertical separation between a deck and a garage are not applicable.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the garage door located on the right side of the lower level, adjacent to the main entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any traditional architectural features such as a garage or main entrance, since it is a conceptual geometric structure. There are no visible doors or entrances, particularly a garage door on the lower level.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the cabin symmetric about its central vertical axis, with the roof peak, main entrance, and supporting columns aligned centrally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure is a polyhedral glass form rather than a traditional cabin. There is no central peak of a roof, main entrance, or support columns to assess symmetry. The geometric shape may have its form of symmetry, but it's unrelated to the cabin features specified.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the vertical support columns beneath the deck present and positioned at regular intervals along the front facade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature any traditional elements such as a deck or support columns, as it is a glass crystal-like structure. Hence, no vertical support columns can be found in front of a fa√ßade.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the small rectangular window located on the lower level, to the left of the main entrance, still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure is a faceted glass formation without traditional elements like windows or entrances. Therefore, there is no small rectangular window visible or related to any entrance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the stone retaining wall made of large, irregular boulders visible on the right side of the cabin's base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include any traditional cabin or building base where a stone retaining wall could be present. It features a glass construction without any stone boulders visible.",
