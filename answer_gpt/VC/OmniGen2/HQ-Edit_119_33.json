      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the subject with sunflowers as part of the background setting, but does not depict a realistic field context, instead presenting as part of a stylized or illustrated frame. Therefore, this differs from a realistic setting.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, stylized light cues and shadowing within the artwork suggest light source directionality, but lack the realistic depiction indicating a specific light source distinctly coming from the upper right. Artistic illustrations often abstract light sources.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face of the subject is blurred, preventing the observation of details such as a smile or the visibility of teeth. Thus, this feature cannot be assessed.",
