      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image preserve the multi-tiered, stepped gable structure of the church, with at least three distinct roof levels stacked vertically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited church maintains a distinct multi-tiered structure with several roof levels stacked vertically, indicative of a traditional stave church commonly characterized by multiple tiers. This visual structure is evident, supported by world knowledge of traditional Scandinavian architecture, often featuring such designs for both functional and aesthetic purposes. Similarly, Image A also displays a multi-tiered roof, showcasing consistent architecture across both images.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible carved wooden patterns along the eaves and gables of the church, even if overlaid with glowing runes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows wooden patterns on the church structures, although they are accompanied by glowing runes. The presence of these intricate design elements aligns with historical wooden church architecture known for detailed carvings. Comparing to Image A, the original church also has carved wooden patterns on its eaves and gables. The glowing runes in Image B serve to add a mystical element without erasing the carved designs.",

      "question": "Is the cross-shaped finial still present at the very top of the central spire, even if partially obscured by glowing celestial orbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the very top of the central spire, there's a finial that maintains a cross-like shape. Even though celestial orbs and glowing effects partially obscure it, its presence can be inferred from the silhouette and the recognized tradition of placing a cross atop such structures. Image A also features a clear cross finial on the church, confirming the design similarity.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image displays horn-like extensions protruding from the corners of the roof tiers, aligning with common stave church motifs that mimic animalistic or natural forms. These decorations and Image A's comparable projections further reinforce the traditional architectural elements of a stave church, featuring such extensions for stylistic purposes.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church appears surrounded by clouds without any visible pathway leading directly to the entrance, suggesting a fantastical or ethereal setting. Conversely, Image A includes a stone-paved pathway leading to the entrance, creating a grounded, accessible approach to the church.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there is a central arched doorway prominently featured, accessible by steps, suggesting entrance accessibility typical of many traditional church designs. Image A showcases a similar design, ensuring the architectural feature's presence in both images even amidst the transformed elements in Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The setting of Image B includes clouds enveloping the base of the church, creating a celestial appearance with no visible trees or shrubs in the foreground. This contrasts with Image A's depiction of snowy evergreens and floral elements, highlighting a terrestrial environment.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is composed of a magical, cloudy atmosphere adorned with mystical orbs and celestial motifs. In contrast, Image A presents a more realistic scene featuring snow-covered mountains and a body of water. The fantastical backdrop in Image B omits these earthly elements to create an otherworldly setting.",
