      "question": "Is the woman depicted in a three-quarter pose, leaning on the column with her head turned toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image B shows a statue of a woman facing directly toward the viewer while resting her left hand on the column. This is not a three-quarter pose, as that would involve her body being turned to the side but showing three-fourths of her face and body. Instead, she is facing forward. Common knowledge about poses helps conclude that this is not a three-quarter pose.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a statue of a woman wearing a gown that is predominantly pastel blue, with floral embellishments visible on the skirt rather than on the bodice and sleeves.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image B depicts a woman wearing a pearl necklace. However, the necklace does not appear to have multiple strands extending down to her chest. By examining typical necklace styles and how they drape, this necklace is a single strand without extension.",
