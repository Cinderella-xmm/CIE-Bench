      "question": "Is the woman’s hair styled in a short, straight black bob that frames her face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's hair appears to be styled in a short, straight bob, as indicated by the length and shape. The hair frames her face on both sides, which is characteristic of a bob style. This conclusion is drawn from the visual structure and understanding of typical bob haircuts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the woman wear a red sleeveless dress with visible knitted texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is depicted wearing a red dress, but it has a smooth texture. The visible features, such as the fitted bodice and flowing skirt, suggest a different material, possibly satin or silk, instead of a knitted texture. The lack of any knitted patterns leads to the conclusion that the dress is not knitted.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the butterfly wings behind her back colored with blue centers, brown borders, and orange tips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly wings behind the woman's back exhibit a color scheme with blue centers, brown borders, and distinctly orange tips. This color combination is observed from the edited image itself, where the pattern on the wings displays these colors clearly.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s hands are positioned at her sides, with no indication of being clasped or fingers interlocked in front of her chest. The depiction in the edited image shows relaxed arms with hands down, not the described interlocked position.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible strap crossing the woman from her right shoulder to her left hip. Her dress appears to be seamless and strapless in that area, lacking any additional accessories such as straps.",

      "question": "Do the woman’s fingernails have bright red polish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's fingernails are not visible in detail to determine if there is any red polish. Therefore, based on the visual cues provided in the edited image and the nature of the depiction, it cannot be confirmed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the woman smiling with red lipstick and dark eyes visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the nature of the image processing, facial details such as a smile, lipstick, or eyes are not visible in Image B. Any attempt to discern such details would rely too heavily on unavailable information about the face.",
