    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the rooster’s comb present on top of its head in a prominent, upright position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rooster is depicted as a vibrant mythical creature. Its comb remains prominently placed on top of its head and is quite noticeable due to its bright red color. This positioning aligns with the typical appearance of a rooster’s comb in real life, being upright and very distinct on the head of the bird.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red fleshy wattles visible under the rooster’s beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, just like in real-life representation, the rooster has dreamy, exaggerated features, but the visuals include red fleshy wattles under its beak. This is consistent with a typical rooster which usually has such wattles hanging below the beak.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the rooster’s beak clearly visible and positioned at the front of the face, with a pointed tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rooster’s beak remains a central feature of its face. Despite the artistic render, the beak is clearly visible at the front, and it maintains the typical pointed shape that is commonly observed in roosters.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the rooster have two legs with three forward-facing toes and one rear toe on each foot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite its fantastical elements, the rooster is represented with two legs. Each leg in the portrayal shows a semblance of three forward-facing claws and likely a rear toe, following the anatomy you'd expect in a real rooster.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the rooster standing on a dark gray asphalt surface with visible debris such as leaves and small plant fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B places the rooster in an abstract, otherworldly setting unlike a natural or realistic environment. The background is dark and undefined, essentially contrasting heavily with the dark gray asphalt and debris scene evident in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the rooster standing upright with its head raised and one foot slightly forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the rooster in a dynamic pose akin to taking flight or making a grand gesture, with its head proudly raised. While its upright stance suggests movement rather than a static pose, the image highlights a vibrant stance similar to an upward posture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the tail positioned at the rear of the rooster’s body and extending upward in a curved shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rooster's tail is graphically extended at the rear, taking a fantastical, fiery form. This tail not only extends upward but also curves and flares outwards, aligning with the idea of an upwardly extending tail, even given the mythical embellishment.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are the neck and chest feathers arranged in overlapping layers with a golden-orange hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rooster features vibrant and stylized feathers in overlapping arrangements across its neck and chest. The feathers shimmer in tones of golden-orange, elaborating upon the natural colors seen in Image A with a more artistic and dramatic execution.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
