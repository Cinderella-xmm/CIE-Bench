    "Question": "Q1: Does the image retain the natural wool texture of the sheep?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subjects are cartoon-like characters (chibi style) depicting young tennis players, and there are no sheep or natural wool textures present. Cartoon characters typically do not have natural textures like wool, hence the absence of sheep with wool textures. Therefore, the natural wool texture of the sheep is not retained in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the sheep retain their darker facial and leg markings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no sheep depicted at all. Instead, the image features two chibi tennis players. Given that no sheep or similar creatures appear, the darker facial and leg markings associated with sheep cannot be retained. Consequently, the sheep's markings are not present in the edited image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the grassy field setting retained, including the distribution of sheep?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a digital illustration of two chibi tennis players, which does not include any feature resembling a grassy field or distribution of sheep as would be expected in a rural landscape.

}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the tree line marking the field's border retained?",

    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the sheep’s natural behaviors, such as grazing or standing, retained?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not contain images of sheep but instead depicts cartoon tennis players, making it impossible to retain any natural behaviors associated with sheep such as grazing or standing. The focus is solely on the characters, absent any animal activity.",
