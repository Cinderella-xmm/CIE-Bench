    "Question": "Q1: Are there exactly five ducklings swimming in the foreground of the scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scene inside the glass dome contains three ducks, two of which are smaller, which can be considered ducklings. The design within the dome includes a picturesque miniaturized landscape with these ducks as part of the integral structure. Based on this observation, there are not five ducklings swimming in the foreground of the scene.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the ducklings have their heads above water and bodies partially submerged, indicating swimming motion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ducks inside the glass dome are placed on rocks rather than swimming in water. This is evident due to the clear depiction of the ducks standing on a grassy area, rather than on a water surface. Therefore, they are not swimming and do not exhibit a swimming motion.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the bed of smooth, rounded stones clearly visible beneath the water surface in the foreground?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on a snow globe-like object featuring a landscape scene including the ducks. The structure inside the dome does not depict any waterbed or stones below a water surface; rather it shows a manufactured miniaturized scene. Therefore, no visible stone bed is present beneath the water surface in this image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the reflection of the evergreen trees and sky clearly visible on the water surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome contains a small-scale landscape, and not an actual water body reflecting trees or sky. While the glass itself might reflect its surroundings, there are no reflections of trees or sky on a water surface within the dome. Therefore, the actual reflection characteristic present in Image A is not present in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are tall evergreen trees densely arranged along both sides of the lake, forming a natural corridor?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature scene within the snow globe shows trees but they are not densely arranged in a way to form a continuous natural corridor along any lake. They are rather part of a miniature setting with fewer trees visible compared to a natural dense arrangement.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is a mist-covered mountain range visible in the background beyond the lake?",
    "explanation": "The image B features a miniature landscape inside a snow globe-like structure and does not include a visible mist-covered mountain range. Instead, it presents a simplified, cartoon-style version of a landscape with hills in the backdrop but lacks the specific visual feature of mist covering mountains.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the dominant colors of the scene green (trees), blue-green (water), and brown (rocks)?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the depicted scene within the globe primarily features green for the trees, some blue for representing water, and the base of the dome has a brownish tint to represent a wood base. These colors, though stylized, mimic natural scenes and match the described color palette.",
    "answer": "Yes"
