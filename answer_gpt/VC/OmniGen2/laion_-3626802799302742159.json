      "question": "Are the cookies still golden-yellow in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cookies are visually represented with a golden-yellow hue. The cartoonish characters are depicted as cookies that appear to maintain the golden-yellow color typical of baked cookies. This conclusion is based on the design of the cookie characters that resemble cookies in both color and shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a red jam filling in the center of each cookie?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each cookie character features a red circle in the center, which resembles the appearance of a red jam filling. This suggests that a red jam filling is represented, consistent with the usual depiction of jam-filled cookies.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the mug white with black speckles and a handle on the right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mugs are cartoon-styled and decorated with faces but are visually white without black speckles. The handles on the mugs are present but not specifically on the right side due to the cartoon representation, which differs from a realistic depiction.",
      "weight": 3,

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the plate pink with a speckled texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the serving plate as pink with a floral design instead of a speckled texture. The plate design features pink patterns rather than speckles, indicating a change from the original texture.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are some cookies inside the mug and others arranged on the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cookies are anthropomorphized characters rather than placed traditionally. They are not inside a mug or arranged flat on a plate as real cookies might be. Instead, these cookie characters are positioned around and inside mugs in an animated style.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mugs and the plate do not have a speckled surface. The design features cartoon-style faces on the mugs and floral patterns on the plate, omitting any speckled texture.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the mug smaller than the plate and positioned centrally on it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the portrayed mugs and cookies are not arranged in a typical serving fashion. The cookies and mugs interact playfully on a plate, but the mug is not centrally positioned relative to a traditional plate and size comparison isn't standard due to the playful, anthropomorphic depiction.",
