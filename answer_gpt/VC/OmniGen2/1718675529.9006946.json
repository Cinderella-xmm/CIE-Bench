      "question": "Are ocean waves present and breaking onto the sandy shore?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual style is abstract and stylized, representing ocean waves primarily through layered curves and shapes, conveying a simplified and graphic version of waves breaking onto the shore. This differs from a realistic depiction with detailed textures like in Image A. Considering the artistic representation, the presence of waves is indicated. Therefore, the interpretation within the context of such artistic expression is that waves are indeed intended to be depicted as breaking onto the shore.",

      "question": "Is the sandy beach present and curving from the foreground toward the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the representation of the beach is minimalistic, using stylized shapes. The sandy area appears as a beige region with a curvature extending towards the right side of the image. Although it is not as detailed as in Image A, where the sand is realistically textured, the abstract form suggests a similar beach layout.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are palm trees visible along the coastline on the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a stylized palm tree is present on the right side. This is represented as a graphic element with a simplified trunk and fronds. Although not as naturalistic as in Image A, where multiple palm trees are present, the single tree serves a similar purpose within the composition.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there three distinct rock formations visible in the foreground sand, clustered together near the right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on stylized and simplified landscape elements without specific details on foreground items like rocks. Instead, the image emphasizes broader elements like waves, the sun, and a palm tree, omitting detailed foreground features like rocks. Thus, three distinct rock formations as seen in Image A are not depicted in this artistic version.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are footprints and ripple patterns visible in the wet sand near the water’s edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a highly stylized approach that does not include intricate details like footprints or ripple patterns in the sand. The focus is on larger elements like waves and the overall beach environment, leaving out specific textures and small features recognizable in a realistic image like Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the coastline visible as a curved line extending into the distance, with green hills rising behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the coastline is implied through the curvature of the wave and beach forms, but it does not convey a realistic perspective or detailed background like Image A, where green hills are a prominent feature. Image B's graphic style does not support such depth of field or background scenery, focusing instead on a flat and abstract visual style.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the sky visible above the horizon, featuring clouds with warm orange and pink tones near the horizon and transitioning to blue higher up?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although Image B does show sky elements like a sun and clouds, its use of colors and tones is simplistic and flat. The sky area employs solid, muted colors, lacking transitions between warm tones and blue shades depicted in Image A’s detailed and realistic sky. This abstract representation does not replicate the nuanced color variation found in nature.",
