      "question": "Are the pointed gables with spire-like finials at the roof peaks present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on visual observation, the edited image depicts several pointed gables with spire-like finials at the topmost parts of the roof. These features are consistent with ornate architectural elements that often cap the roof peaks for decorative purposes. Combining this visual information with common architectural knowledge, we can affirm their presence.",

      "question": "Is there a central balcony with intricately carved wooden railing located below the uppermost gable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the edited image, there is no visible balcony below the uppermost gable. Instead, the structure is presented under a glass dome without any features such as balconies. Therefore, based on the visual cues, the presence of a central balcony with carved railings is not identified.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the windows on the facade are arched, featuring curved tops that suggest an emphasis on decorative style. Though simple, they exhibit elements reminiscent of tracery designs often seen in traditional and fantasy architecture.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image clearly shows the roof of the miniature structure covered in vividly blue shingles, denoting a choice of materials meant to mimic traditional shingling with a distinct colored appearance. This is further highlighted by the synergy of the structure's architectural aesthetics.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image illustrates a model under a glass dome, where the surface appears polished and brightly colored with very limited visible natural wood texture or finish. The model primarily showcases pastel tones and embellishments rather than an unfinished wood texture.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base level of the structure in the edited image features a prominently centered single door, stylized in a manner suggestive of wood, though exhibiting a smooth, bright tone typical in decorative miniatures rather than raw wooden material.",

      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inspection of the edited image reveals a symmetrical arrangement on the front facade, constructed symmetrically about a central axis. This common architectural practice helps achieve balance and visual appeal, evident in the mirrored segments of the facade.",
