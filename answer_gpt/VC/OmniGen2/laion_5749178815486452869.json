    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the open umbrella retain its circular canopy shape with visible radial ribs converging at a central hub?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no open umbrella present at all. Instead, the image depicts a floating piece of land with an apple, flowers, and a structure against a starlit sky. Therefore, the feature of an open umbrella with a circular canopy and radial ribs is not applicable to Image B.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the closed umbrella present with a black casing, wrist strap, and metallic tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the lower part, there is a closed umbrella depicted with a black casing, and a visible wrist strap. Although the tip isn't metallic, the design indicates a similar feature to what might be termed in image A as a metallic tip feature, adjusting for artistic depiction.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the starlit sky with visible stars and nebulae still present as the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a starlit sky with numerous bright stars and a prominent celestial body resembling the moon, consistent with a starlit sky scene. However, the presence of nebulae isn't distinctly visible or notable.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the scene composed with flowers in the foreground, a hill in the midground, and the sky in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is depicted with a floating piece of land that contains flowers and an apple, but the layout of foreground, midground hill, and background sky isn't structured in the same manner as a typical natural setting. The floating island makes the typical arrangement non-standard.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the black support ribs visible and extending from the central hub to the edge of the canopy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature an open umbrella, therefore, there are no black support ribs visible, and there is no canopy structure present to involve such details.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are yellow coneflowers and red poppies present in the foreground of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are some flowers present as part of the floating island but they are not specifically identifiable as yellow coneflowers and red poppies. The type and visual style do not strongly resemble these particular flowers.",
