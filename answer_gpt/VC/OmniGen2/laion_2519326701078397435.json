      "question": "Is the bust oriented in a side profile facing to the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bust is seen facing forward, not in a side profile. The visual cues such as the orientation of the shoulders and the front-facing chest indicate that it is positioned in a frontal view. In sculptures, a side profile would typically show only one shoulder and a distinct side view of the head. Therefore, the bust in Image B does not face to the right in a side profile.",

      "question": "Is there an inscribed plaque on the base with the word \"APOLLO\" visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the bust does not display any visible inscribed plaque or lettering. Typically, a plaque would be clearly marked on the pedestal, but Image B shows a more industrial or steampunk-like design without explicit textual inscriptions, in contrast to the lettering visible on the base in Image A.",

      "question": "Are the proportions of the neck, shoulders, and chest consistent with the original sculptural form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the neck, shoulders, and chest present classical proportions typical of a traditional bust sculpture. In Image B, while the artistic style has changed to be more steampunk, the underlying proportions of the neck, shoulders, and chest generally maintain the consistency of a human bust form, aligning with classical sculptural proportions.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the drapery extend from the left shoulder across the chest in a diagonal fold?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of classical drapery, there are mechanical and steampunk elements wrapping around the bust. While some elements appear to extend across the chest, these are not traditional drapery as in Image A. The material and style differ, moving away from the classical sculptural drapery.",

      "question": "Is the base a cylindrical pedestal with a flat top and rounded bottom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a base that is more complex, potentially cylindrical but with mechanical designs, differing significantly from a simple, flat-topped, and rounded-bottom pedestal. The imagery displays a more industrial-style base as opposed to the plain cylindrical one seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Is there a small circular medallion or button-like ornament on the left shoulder of the drapery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible small circular medallion or ornament easily identifiable on any drapery, as the bust does not feature traditional draped fabric but rather mechanical elements. Such an ornament is seen in Image A, but it is absent in the steampunk-styled Image B.",
