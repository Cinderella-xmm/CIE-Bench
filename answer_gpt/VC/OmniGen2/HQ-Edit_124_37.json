      "question": "Is the subject's skin tone still dark brown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the visual cues show the subject has visible skin on the arms. The skin tone appears lighter and less brown compared to darker brown skin tones in general. Based on world knowledge, the transformation may involve a more stylized or artistic representation where traditional skin tones are altered.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues suggest the subject's head is slightly tilted upward, as indicated by the position of the neck and body orientation. This upward tilt generally implies a direction toward the sky.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual observation shows the subject's arms extended outward from the body, consistent with a stance where both arms are open. The orientation of the hands suggests open palms facing forward, a posture often seen in open or welcoming gestures.",

    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the subject with a hairstyle that includes elements like rows of hair close to the scalp, typically indicating braids. These visual cues, combined with stylized and artistic depictions found in certain characterizations, aligns with a braided hairstyle.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the garment's lower portion appears spread out and flared, indicating movement. This flaring design, commonly seen in motion depictions, conveys a sense of dynamic action or flow.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the subject smiling with visible teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the face remains blurred, there are insufficient visual cues to determine a smile with visible teeth. Typically, a visible smile would display specific mouth features, but these are not detectable.",
