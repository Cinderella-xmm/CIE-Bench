      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seated person appears to be holding the cake with both hands. However, if we look closely, only one hand is visible clutching the cake while the other doesn't seem to be holding it. This assessment is made based on the visual characteristics of how hands hold and support objects, combining assumptions about stability and general human behavior when holding cakes to prevent them from falling.",

      "question": "Is the standing person still in the act of throwing a gray object over the seated person's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the standing person is captured with an arm raised, appearing to be in motion above the seated person's head. This posture suggests that the person is still in the act of throwing a gray object over the seated person's head. This reasoning comes from understanding typical actions associated with reaching over another person in a celebratory or playful context, aligning with the scene's dynamics.",

      "question": "Are the candles on the cake still lit in a soft glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the candles on the cake emit a prominent light, further emphasized due to the editing increasing brightness and yellow tones. This indicates that the candles are still lit. The soft glow is assumed from the ambient light that candles typically produce and the context of a celebratory cake.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the refrigerator containing drinks remains in the same position as previously seen. It is visible in the background to the left of the seated person, indicating no changes in spatial arrangement. Familiar objects like refrigerators containing drinks are typical elements expected in a café setting, maintaining coherence between the images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears warmer and richer compared to Image A, with more expressive yellows and oranges. This results in lighting that seems more evenly distributed and warmer across the scene. The warm lighting ambiance is a common practice in cafés to create inviting atmospheres, discernible by the emphasis on warm color tones in the scene.",
