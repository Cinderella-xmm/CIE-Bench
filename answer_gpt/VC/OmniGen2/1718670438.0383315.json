      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the robot retain its dome-shaped head with three evenly spaced circular porthole eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot maintains its dome-shaped head. It features two circular porthole eyes that are evenly spaced. The top of the head has additional protuberances, but none resemble a third porthole eye. The original description suggests three porthole eyes, but Image B only visibly has two.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the transparent chest panel still present, clearly displaying the internal gear system?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's chest panel remains transparent, and the internal gear system is visible through this panel. This visibility suggests a similar engineering focus as seen in many steampunk designs, where mechanical parts are often exposed for aesthetic purposes.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do both arms retain their segmented, piston-style joint construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows both arms of the robot with visible segmentation and joint structures that resemble pistons, a common design in mechanical and robotic systems for articulation and movement.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both feet equipped with exactly five claw-like toes each?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's feet are visible, and each appears to have fewer than five claw-like toes. The design shows a simplified foot structure, deviating from the originally specified detail.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there five distinct spires and antennae on top of the robot’s head, including one central and four lateral ones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays the top of the robot's head, but it features only one central spire and possibly other smaller elements. It does not exhibit five distinct spires or antennae as described in the question.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are multiple interlocking gears of different sizes visible through the transparent chest panel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observation of Image B, through the transparent chest panel, multiple interlocking gears of varying sizes are visible, consistent with the steampunk aesthetic where mechanical intricacy is showcased.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the robot maintain its original oxidized bronze and copper color scheme with visible wear and aging effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the robot in a bronze and copper color scheme, but there are no visible signs of oxidation or significant wear and aging effects. The finish appears more polished than aged.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are the rivets and mechanical fasteners visible along the joints and edges of the robot’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the detailing along the robot's body, including rivets and mechanical fasteners, is visible along the joints and edges, aligning with typical mechanical structures where fasteners are used for assembly and articulation.",
