      "question": "Is the cosmic vortex depicted as a multi-layered spiral structure with concentric rings winding inward toward a central point?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cosmic vortex is depicted as a multi-layered spiral structure, resembling a stained glass design with concentric rings. The visual cues show a series of colorful, segmented sections forming a spiral towards a central point, supporting the multi-layered structure concept within the design context.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there multiple trees with rounded, full canopies positioned in the foreground and midground of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, there are several trees with rounded, full canopies included within the stained glass design, distinguishing them with vibrant colors and outlined segments typical of such artwork styles. The presence of full, rounded canopy silhouettes confirms the arrangement in the foreground and midground of the scene.",

      "question": "Is the cosmic vortex positioned directly above the forest, occupying the upper half of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cosmic vortex occupies the central portion of the stained glass design. It fills more than just the upper half, extending into various layers integrated with the scene's design, indicative of a cosmic theme. So while it's central and significant, it isn't strictly occupying the upper half, but maintains a balanced composition within the art's confines.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a calm, reflective body of water in the foreground, mirroring the sky and surrounding landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nature of Image B as a stained glass depiction means that the intricate details like a reflective water body are transformed into abstract representations rather than detailed landscape features. The depiction of elements focuses primarily on the spiral form and trees without distinct features like a reflective water body seen in typical landscapes.",

      "question": "Are there mountain ranges visible in the background, situated behind the trees and beneath the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stained glass art includes elements resembling mountain ranges in the background. Using artistic representation, these stylized features are architecturally outlined beneath the spiraling sky pattern and among the lower sections. The design places them behind the trees, adhering to traditional landscape compositional styles.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, within the stained glass art style, the trees exhibit vibrant colors, notably with orange hues seen in the foliage. These hues depict fall and autumn tones rather than pink or rose-colored foliage more prevalent in other seasonal depictions, allowing a differentiation in color use between seasonal influences.",
