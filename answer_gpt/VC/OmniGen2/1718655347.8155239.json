      "question": "Is there a large, circular, reddish celestial body located in the upper left portion of the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a large, circular red moon prominently featured in the center of the sky. Its color and shape are indicative of a celestial object. This observation, combined with common design elements in illustrations, confirms that it is intended to represent a celestial body, likely a moon.",

      "question": "Is there a prominent mountain range with snow-covered peaks spanning the background behind the lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a prominent mountain range in the background with peaks that appear to be covered in snow, which is characterized by their white coloration and sharp edges. These visual characteristics are typically associated with snow-capped mountains, especially in artistic depictions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground is dominated by a depiction of a large body of water, occupying the central position of the image. Its smooth texture and color gradients suggest it is designed to resemble a reflective water surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image clearly depicts clusters of trees with a notable red color lining both banks of the lake, which stands out against the otherwise natural color palette, illustrating the artistic choice to use vibrant reds for the foliage.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design of the lake surface indicates some reflective qualities, with blue and minor reflections. However, it does not visually show distinct reflections of the red moon or the snow-capped mountains as might be expected.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
