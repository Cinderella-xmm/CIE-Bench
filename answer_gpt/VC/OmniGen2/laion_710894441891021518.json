    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the white tea light candle present on the black surface to the left of the bonsai pot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no tea light candle visible on the surface. The focus is shifted onto the decorative statue inside a pot, with nothing else present on the surface. The visual composition suggests a clean and unobstructed presentation of the statue.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the bonsai and candle resting on a flat black surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a green decorative statue positioned in a green pot, seemingly resting on a dark surface. However, there is no candle present along with the pot, and the focus is entirely on the aesthetic display of the statue. This implies that the surface is not cluttered.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background uniformly light gray with no visible patterns or objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a dark background with no patterns or additional objects. The focus is solely on the vibrant and colorful statue which is illuminated and contrasted against the dark backdrop, rather than a plain light gray background.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bonsai planted in a wide, shallow, teal-colored ceramic pot that occupies the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a decorative statue which is placed in a green-themed pot. While the pot is centrally located, it is not the shallow teal variety seen in a typical bonsai arrangement. The appearance suggests that the pot complements the statue's color theme rather than serving as a bonsai container.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on a decorative statue, and the surface of the pot exhibits a stylized moss with a few artificial elements. There are no signs of natural bonsai soil or exposed roots visible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the bonsai positioned centrally and upright in the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a green statue centrally positioned in an upright manner within the frame. Although it is not a bonsai, the composition is similar in its central placement and vertical orientation, focusing on the statue's aesthetic presentation.",
