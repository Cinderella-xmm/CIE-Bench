      "question": "Are there four clock faces, one on each visible side of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower is depicted with two visible clock faces, one on each side that can be seen. Due to the artistic cartoon style, only two sides of the tower are visible, limiting the count of visible clock faces. This absence of four visible sides prevents the confirmation of four clock faces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the clock faces contain black Roman numerals arranged in a circular pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the clock faces with black Roman numerals clearly arranged in a circular pattern around each clock face, which is a commonly seen design for traditional clock towers.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a steeply pitched pyramidal roof topped with a finial at the very top of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the tower with a steeply pitched pyramidal roof that's consistent with historic clock tower designs. At the apex of this roof, a finial is visible, confirming the presence of these architectural elements.",
      "weight": 3,

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there four arched openings at the base of the tower, one on each side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoonish Image B depicts the lower section of the tower with arched openings, two of which are visible. This indicates the potential for a symmetrical design with additional arches on non-visible sides based on typical architectural symmetry.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower is positioned in the middle of a circular road, where vehicles are shown moving along the road, corroborating the scenario of a central roundabout or traffic circle.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

        "Yes",
        "No"
