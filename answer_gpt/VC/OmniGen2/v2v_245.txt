    "Question": "Q1: Are the two jet engines mounted under the wings of the airplane present and correctly positioned?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, we see a toy airplane as part of a toy set. Looking at the design, the toy airplane is depicted with two jet engines mounted under its wings. The placement of these engines mimics the typical setup of commercial airplanes, with engines mounted beneath each wing. This positioning is consistent with conventional toy airplane designs that aim to replicate real aircraft.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the continuous row of oval-shaped passenger windows visible along the side of the fuselage?",
    "explanation": "The toy airplane in Image B does indeed have a painted or possibly molded pattern that resembles passenger windows. These are typically represented by a series of hits or marks along the fuselage, simulating the multiple windows found on real airplanes. Although simplified, this design gives the reference to actual passenger windows.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the rounded nose cone with the three-part cockpit window configuration present at the front of the airplane?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, similar to real airplanes, the toy airplane features a rounded nose cone. Additionally, there is a cockpit window pattern consisting of lines indicating a three-part window style on the front of the airplane. This design element mimics the appearance of actual cockpit windows found at the front of commercial airplanes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the tall vertical stabilizer (tail fin) present at the rear of the airplane?",
    "explanation": "Image B's toy airplane includes a vertical stabilizer or tail fin at the rear, which is a common feature in both real and model airplanes. This component is crucial for stability, and its presence in toy designs is often simplified yet apparent for recognition purposes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the landing gear assemblies with multiple wheels visible beneath the fuselage and wings?",
    "explanation": "The toy airplane depicted in Image B has a simplified landing gear, typical of toy designs, with wheels beneath the fuselage. Such toys usually feature simplified yet recognizable components that serve as an approximation of actual landing gear assemblies, owing to their smaller size and functional focus.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the main wing structure extending from the fuselage with engines mounted underneath?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a toy airplane with its main wing structure extending from the fuselage, with jet engines positioned under the wings. This configuration is a key characteristic of commercial aircraft layouts and is also replicated in toy airplane designs for authenticity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the three cockpit windows arranged in a horizontal line at the front of the airplane?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cockpit window on the toy airplane is arranged to resemble the typical style seen in real-life aircraft, where three windows are aligned horizontally at the forefront. This design choice helps mimic real cockpit designs, providing a sense of realism to the toy despite its simplified nature.",
    "answer": "Yes"
