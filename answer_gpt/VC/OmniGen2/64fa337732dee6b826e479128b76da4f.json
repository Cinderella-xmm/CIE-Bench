    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the woman's facial structure, including her eyes, nose, and mouth, preserved in their original form and positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's face has been blurred, eliminating the details of her facial features such as eyes, nose, and mouth. Typically, facial structure includes identifiable features which are now concealed due to the blur effect. Therefore, it is clear that none of the original features and positioning are preserved.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dark hair arranged in an updo with a blue ribbon placed on the left side of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dark hair styled in an updo with ribbons, but the ribbon is placed symmetrically on the crown rather than distinctly to the left. Analyzing Image A, the ribbon appears on the left side; thus, clearly in Image B, the ribbon placement is altered.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the dress designed with an off-the-shoulder neckline that exposes the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dress in Image B is off-the-shoulder, as evident by the visual of the shoulders and neckline style typical of historical fashion that exposes shoulders. Image A also features such a neckline, but this confirms the neckline style in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a golden necklace with a pendant visible around the woman’s neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no golden necklace or pendant can be seen around the woman's neck. The neck appears clear, lacking such a necklace. Image A features a necklace, signaling its removal or absence in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a ring visible on the woman’s right hand, specifically on the ring finger?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the woman’s hands with bracelets visible but no ring is discernible on the right hand's ring finger. Comparison with Image A, where rings are visible, confirms the absence in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the red-and-gold heraldic crest visible in the upper-right corner of the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "No red-and-gold heraldic crest is discernible in the upper-right corner of Image B. The background is primarily composed of chair images bordered with pearls. Image A features a crest, indicating its removal in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the woman seated with her arms crossed across her chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the woman's arms are positioned on her waist with hands resting or holding her dress. She is not seated with arms crossed across her chest. Analysis with Image A shows a different arm position, supporting the conclusion.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the woman looking directly at the viewer with her eyes open and focused forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the blurred face, the direction and focus of her gaze is indeterminate. Typical direct gaze requires visibility of the eyes, which are covered, making the determination of direction impossible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
