      "question": "Is the three-tiered wooden table structure with horizontal slats and vertical supports still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no presence of a three-tiered wooden table structure with horizontal slats and vertical supports. Instead, the image portrays a decorative scene with a glass dome covering clay models and figures, which suggests a completely reimagined setting. The original Image A depicts a clear three-tiered wooden table structure, making such similar features absent in Image B.",

      "question": "Are both the asymmetrical clay vase with a pinched neck and the symmetrical clay vase still present on the upper tier?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are three grey vases, none of which appears to have an asymmetrical, pinched neck. The setup features these pottery pieces in a decorative scenario enclosed in a glass dome. On the other hand, Image A had distinct clay vases on the upper tier, including an asymmetrical clay vase with a pinched neck. The difference in setups confirms the absence of the same vases from Image A within Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there is a circular clay piece present, it is not positioned behind the vases, nor does it have a central hole as in Image A. Instead, the circular piece is part of an artistic scene under a glass dome. Image A distinctly features a flat circular clay piece with a central hole on the upper tier, suggesting its specific absence in Image B in the same context.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene under the dome does not include a rectangular block of gray clay like the one featured in Image A. The rectangular clay block is clearly visible in the original setup of Image A on the table, making its absence in the redesigned scene of Image B apparent.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include any white fabric scraps draped over the edge or under a table, as seen in Image A. The thematic elements in Image B are entirely different, focusing on a decorative miniature garden scene under a glass dome. Image A distinctly displays fabric scraps, confirming their absence in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a presence of a small tool within the decorative scene, placed on the moss near the miniature figures, though not on a table with a clay block as in Image A. This suggests a different usage of space and items within Image B compared to Image A, where the modeling tool was situated on the lower table near the clay block.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a flat circular wooden base under the glass dome, which supports the entire decorative setup, differing from Image A's rectangular wooden base that supported the structure. Both images contain flat bases; however, Image B's base is fundamentally a different shape and purpose.",
