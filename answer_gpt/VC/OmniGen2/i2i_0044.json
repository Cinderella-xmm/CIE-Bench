      "question": "Is the sandwich cross-section with layered ingredients clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandwich is depicted in a cartoon style with emphasis on simple shapes and clear layers. The cross-section is stylized with visible layers such as the lettuce and what appears to be meat. Thus, the cartoon's simplicity and use of bold outlines make the cross-section of layered ingredients noticeable. This contrasts with Image A, where the actual sandwich shows detailed and textured layers.",

      "question": "Does the sandwich bread retain its golden-brown crust appearance despite the cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandwich bread is illustrated with a distinct golden-brown hue, typical of a freshly baked appearance, albeit in a simplified cartoon form. The color choice for the bread indicates an effort to convey a warm, appetizing look, which aligns with the golden-brown appearance of the bread in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the sandwich remain on the white, rectangular plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a cartoon sandwich sitting on a white, albeit stylized, rectangular plate. The shape and color of the plate are consistent with the original concept, though the artistic style simplifies and exaggerates the plateâ€™s features compared to Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is replaced with a bright orange, eliminating any depiction of a wooden surface. This differs significantly from Image A, where the sandwich lies on a visible wooden table, showcasing its surface texture and color.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoon sandwich in Image B appears to be centered on the plate, similar to the arrangement in Image A where the actual sandwich is placed centrally. The orientation of both sandwiches on their respective plates is consistent with being the main focus of the composition.",
