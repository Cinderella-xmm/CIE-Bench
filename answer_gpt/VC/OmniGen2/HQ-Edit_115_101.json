      "question": "Is the radial floral and scrollwork pattern with symmetrical swirls and leaf-like motifs present around the central area of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a bottle with a label that features a radial pattern of floral and scrollwork designs. The pattern is symmetrical, with swirls and leaf-like motifs clearly visible around the central label area. The design is intricate and spreads outwards from the center, typical of radial arrangements used in decorative arts. Thus, the floral and scrollwork pattern is affirmatively present.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the Roman numerals I through XII arranged in a circular sequence around the central label or design element?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the label of the bottle features Roman numerals. However, the numerals do not appear to be in a full circular sequence from I to XII, as in a clock face. Instead, there are only a few numerals visible, making it not a complete circular sequence commonly associated with all 12 hours. Therefore, the arrangement does not encompass I through XII in a circular fashion.",

      "question": "Do the decorative patterns exhibit clear embossed relief with visible depth and shadowing, indicating raised surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral and scrollwork patterns on the bottle show notable depth and shadowing, suggesting they are in an embossed relief style. The play of light and shadow creates a three-dimensional effect on the surface of the bottle, indicating the presence of raised textures that are typical of embossed designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a clearly defined central circular element positioned at the geometric center of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the label on the bottle is a circular element positioned centrally. The label acts as a focal point, with the radial designs emanating from it ensuring its centrality in the composition. This central circular element is very distinct and occupies the expected position as a centerpiece of the design.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are small decorative dots and filigree details integrated into the scrollwork, particularly at junctions and tips of curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the decorative pattern is intricate, the close inspection does not clearly reveal the presence of small decorative dots and filigree details at the junctions and tips of the curves within the scrollwork pattern. The emphasis is on larger floral and scroll motifs rather than such minute details.",
