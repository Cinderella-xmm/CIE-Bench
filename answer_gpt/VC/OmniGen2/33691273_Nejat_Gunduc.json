      "question": "Is the Coca-Cola bottle present in the advertisement with its distinctive curved shape and visible partial logo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the advertisement has shifted from a photographic image to a graphic, similar to comic art style, where a cartoonish representation of a Coca-Cola bottle can be seen. Despite the stylization, it retains the curved shape characteristic of Coca-Cola bottles, with part of the Coca-Cola name visible, affirming its presence.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the white earbud visible in the woman’s ear with the wire extending downward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized cartoon depiction maintains the notable features of the original advertisement. The white earbud is incorporated, complete with the wire extending downward, mirroring its placement in Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are both the man and the woman shown in profile, facing to the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are rendered in profile, with their bodies oriented to the right. The artistic approach maintains their facing direction in relation to each other and their alignment within the composition, akin to Image A.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the man’s right hand positioned near his ear, holding the earbud in a manner that mimics the woman’s use?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the man's hand is shown raised, but it doesn't mimic the act of holding an earbud as seen in Image A. His posture and the detailing suggest a different action than holding an earbud.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformation into a bold graphic style eliminates such delicate cues like torn or peeling surfaces. The top-right corner appears intact with no visible wear, unlike any damage observable in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the placement of the man from Image A, having him in front of the advertisement, leaning against it and thus overlapping with it, establishing a consistent spatial arrangement.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized representation of the advertisement features a bottle where the word 'Coca' is partially visible, suggesting its legibility albeit within a comic-style portrayal. This maintains connection with Image A's visible logo.",
