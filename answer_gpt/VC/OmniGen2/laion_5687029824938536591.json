      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoe features a triangular panel structure that extends across the midfoot, similar to Image A. The placement and alignment are consistent with the original design. The panel's shape and arrangement serve both aesthetic and functional purposes in shoe design, such as stability and support, and the edited image has maintained this feature.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible 'SPEEDCROSS' text positioned along the lateral side of the shoe as seen in Image A. The text is either missing or is not clearly visible in the edited version which suggests alteration or removal in this aspect of the design.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Salomon logo is not seen on the shoe's heel counter in the typical location as seen in Image A. The heel branding is missing or altered, while the tongue tab retains a logo in the same spot, indicating partial preservation. Typically, branding positions are consistent in original designs due to brand identification purposes, and any discrepancies highlight a modification.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lace system seems altered with fewer visible eyelets, differing from Image A's design which had a specific arrangement and number of eyelets for practical functionality like fit adjustment. The edited version appears to have deviated, showing a change in the lacing mechanism.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outsole lug pattern appears similar to Image A, retaining a design vital for traction. However, the 'contagrip' text seen in Image A is missing in Image B, suggesting a removal or omission in the edited design. The outsole and branding are typically maintained in shoes for functionality and marketing purposes, making changes notable.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The reinforced toe cap and the embossing of 'S' in Image B differ from those in Image A. Image B shows a more rounded toe cap without the prominent embossed 'S' seen in Image A. The toe cap typically serves protection and branding functions, and changes suggest alterations from the original design.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the label 'LT LIGHT WEIGHT MIDSOLE' is not visible near the heel as it is in Image A, indicating a modification or removal. Such labels often denote technological features of the shoe, important for marketing and functionality differentiation, making its absence notable.",
