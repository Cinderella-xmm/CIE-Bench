      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the U.S. national insignia (white star within a blue circle, flanked by red and white bars) present on the wings and fuselage of the aircraft?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the aircraft is displayed as a model enclosed in a glass case. The aircraft has a distinct design with insignia resembling a military marking on its side. However, upon close inspection, the markings on the aircraft in Image B do not match the U.S. national insignia (white star within a blue circle, flanked by red and white bars). Instead, they are more decorative and simplified, possibly using an 'X' symbol on the tail, characteristic of a fictional or stylized design rather than authentic U.S. markings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there two radial engines mounted beneath the wings of the aircraft, one on each side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the aircraft is a model with a single-engine configuration rather than having two radial engines mounted beneath the wings. This is evident as the aircraft is shown with a single propeller at the front, indicating a single-engine setup unlike an aircraft with two radial engines that would typically have a propeller on each of its engines on either wing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does each engine have a three-bladed propeller attached to its front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The aircraft model in Image B features a single engine with a propeller at the front. The propeller visibly shows three blades attached. This kind of propeller configuration is common for vintage or stylized aircraft models, where attention to detail in propeller design reflects iconic features.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a rounded, transparent cockpit canopy located at the front of the fuselage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the aircraft model has a distinctive streamlined shape; however, its cockpit canopy is not rounded and transparent but more of a solid color matching the plane's body. The design choice reflects the stylized, miniature nature of the model and does not aim for an exact replica of aircraft with such canopies.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the wings extend straight and symmetrically from the fuselage, forming a dihedral angle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings of the model aircraft extend out from the fuselage in a straight manner but lack any noticeable dihedral angle, where wings would typically angle upwards. The wings appear to maintain a level attitude typical for models and simplify versus technical aerodynamic designs found in real aircraft.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the tail section composed of a vertical stabilizer and two horizontal stabilizers with small fins at the ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The model aircraft in Image B includes a tail section design consisting of a vertical stabilizer, with the addition of horizontal stabilizers. However, there are no small fins at the ends of the horizontal stabilizers, marking a deviation from a more complex tail structure that might be present in a fully detailed aircraft model.",
