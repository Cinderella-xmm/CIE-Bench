    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are all leaf-shaped elements in the image, including those used as heads, clearly five-pointed maple leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows various leaf elements scattered around the illustration. Based on the visual cues, I can see that not all of these leaves are clearly five-pointed maple leaves, as some may have variations due to design alterations, like additional lines or personalized features for the heads. Common knowledge about maple leaves is they possess a distinct shape, usually five-pointed, aiding in identifying them. Thus, considering these visual interpretations, not all leaves fit this description precisely.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are all leaf elements rendered exclusively in shades of orange, yellow, and red?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, leaf elements are observable in several shades. The dominant colors are orange, yellow, and red, which are typical for fall or Thanksgiving thematic designs. By recognizing these common color representations and their typical context in autumn-related imagery, it's reasonable to conclude that the leaf colors are limited to these shades.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a solid brown rectangular border surrounding the central illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "With reference to Image B, there is indeed a rectangular border around the central illustration, which appears solid and consistent in color, brown, barring any design interventions. Comparing this to Image A, it seems to maintain the original structure, assisting in maintaining visual organization typically seen in greeting cards. This aligns with the conventional use of borders in printed and illustrated materials for distinction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background of the card uniformly white?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the background isn't entirely white as originally described. It has a warm, possibly orange hue. Through understanding card designs generally, uniform white is often chosen for elegance and simplicity, but Image B takes a more vibrant approach, altering this foundational attribute to potentially enhance a seasonal feel. Comparing this against Image A's originally white background shows a significant deviation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the central illustration positioned centrally within the card, bounded by the rectangular frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Evaluating Image B, the illustration resides centrally in the bordered card space. That aids in maintaining symmetry common in card designs to ensure the focus remains on the primary message or graphical content. This central placement is verified visually and aligned with typical design principles. A comparative glance at the original layout in Image A confirms consistency in this positioning arrangement, reaffirming conventional placement.",
