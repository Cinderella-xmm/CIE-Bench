      "question": "Is the bindi present on the dancer's forehead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In traditional Indian dance costumes, a bindi is a small dot or decorative mark worn on the forehead, often seen in Bharatanatyam performances. In Image B, we need to observe the forehead region to identify any decorative mark indicative of a bindi. The absence of clear indicators of a bindi in this image means the answer is based on typical visual identification.",

      "question": "Does the dancer have dark braided hair secured with decorative pins?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Indian dance forms, dark braided hair is often adorned with decorative pins to enhance visual appeal. In Image B, observe the dancer's hair style, color, and presence of any decorative pins. The dancer's hairstyle appears secure, but based on the visual representation and details seen, it doesn't distinctly feature dark braided hair with pins.",

      "question": "Is there a white floral garland on the left side of the dancer's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Floral garlands are traditional hair adornments. In Image B, on the left side of the dancer's head, observe any presence of floral elements or garlands. The visual cue of a white floral arrangement prominently visible on the dancer's head suggests the presence of such a garland.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Golden ornaments, such as headpieces, are common in classical Indian dance costumes. In Image B, examine the crown area for any golden adornments. The distinct presence of a golden decorative piece at the top of the dancer's head confirms this feature.",

      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In examining a side profile view, the dancer would display a sideways orientation with one side more visible. In Image B, the dancer's orientation is straightforward, showing both arms equally with a frontal orientation suggesting a non-side profile posture.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The described leg position involves an elevated right leg with a specific knee bent and foot orientation. In Image B, check the dancer’s lower body posture for this positioning. The leg appears to be more traditionally placed with no drastic elevation or bent knee.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "This posture implies an upright body stance with a slight twist, contributing to classical dance expression. In Image B, examine the dancer’s overall stance for balance and any torso rotation or typical dance postures. The dancer's stance appears balanced and upright with a slight torso twist, even though the leg is not elevated.",
