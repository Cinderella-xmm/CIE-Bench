        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show a hairstyle that resembles a neat silver bun on top of the woman's head. The bun is symmetric and well-organized, indicative of careful grooming. This style matches the formal presentation a portrait seeks to convey.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visuals show the woman wearing earrings; however, they are not white pearls. They bear a resemblance to golden or metallic earrings instead.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The book held by the woman in Image B appears to have a leather cover, but it is independent of explicit aging cues. Although the book design is ornate, the imagery here simplifies the depiction and makes the perception of page aging difficult.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict any table or items, such as a teacup, located to the right of the woman. The portrait features elements more like artistic decorations or symbols, and does not visually confirm the presence of such items.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Without an actual depiction of a teacup on a table, Image B focuses on decorative motifs instead, lacking a concrete depiction of a teacup and saucer in a realistic setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any table setting with fabric. The focus of the image is more emblematic and does not involve furnishing elements like fabrics or textiles.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman appears as though facing directly forward which is a common portrait style. However, the concept of sitting at a table is not evident as the image leans more toward decorative representation than realistic depiction.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not visually imply a context with bookshelves. Instead, it incorporates decorative elements like drinkware that serve as symbolic rather than replicating real-life scenarios with bookshelves.",
