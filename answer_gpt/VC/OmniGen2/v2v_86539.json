      "question": "Do the characters retain their potato-like shape and texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters have a rounded shape typical of potato-like figures, which maintains their possibly intended whimsical representation. The texture and coloring in the illustration are simplified in a cartoon style. Comparing this to Image A, while the potato shape is retained, Image B uses a more vibrant and dynamic art style resulting in a slight variation from the original texture, though the essence of potato character remains intact.",

      "question": "Is the potato character in the first panel still depicted as exercising with dumbbells and wearing a green headband?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the first panel shows the potato character wearing a green headband, suggesting an activity related to exercise or sports given the common association of headbands with exercise. However, there are no dumbbells in sight, which departs from the original depiction in Image A where the potato character holds dumbbells, clearly indicating exercise.",

      "question": "Does the potato character in the second panel remain inside a cardboard box, indicating sleep?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B's second panel, the potato character is indeed within a cardboard box and has closed eyes, which signifies a sleeping posture. This is consistent with the depiction in Image A, where the potato character appears rested inside a box, indicating sleep.",

      "question": "Is the potato character in the third panel still seated at a table with food items, indicating eating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the potato character seated at a table writing with a pen, rather than consuming food, as suggested by the Image A depiction where the potato figure interactively engages with food items at the table indicating an eating activity.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Are all three panels distinctly showing the activities of exercising, sleeping, and eating respectively?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates distinct activities across the panels: the first panel suggests an engaged, happy character possibly related to exercise but without dumbbells, the second panel clearly shows sleeping, and the third panel depicts writing rather than eating at a table. Therefore, while sleeping remains consistent, exercising and eating are not accurately illustrated in Image B.",
