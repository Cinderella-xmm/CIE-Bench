    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the crown-like forehead design with three dots and a central triangle present on the child's forehead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blurred area prevents any detailed visualization of forehead patterns or designs. Therefore, without any visible elements resembling a crown-like forehead design, the answer is deduced by default to be negative.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the lace-like borders encircling the eyes clearly visible and symmetrically drawn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a blurred face, with no specific lace-like borders or details around the eyes. Therefore, based on visual information, the borders are not present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the mouth depicted with a stitched, jagged-tooth pattern and vertical lines extending from the nose to the chin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering that in Image B, the blur obscures specific facial features and details, any depiction of a stitched mouth with particular patterns is not visible.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the eyes positioned symmetrically and maintain their original almond shape and direct forward gaze?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not provide specific visibility to analyze eye placement or shape due to the blur, which results in the inability to confirm symmetry or gaze direction.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the makeup pattern symmetrically aligned across the left and right sides of the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurring in Image B obstructs details that would describe makeup or its symmetry. There are no evident symmetrical patterns on the face.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the nose bridge clearly defined and retains its original shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given that Image B presents a blurred face, the specific anatomy or defined shape of the nose bridge isn't visible, precluding verification of this detail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the natural lip contours visible beneath the painted teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurred overlay in Image B makes it impossible to discern any fine details involving lip contours and any teeth patterns.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
