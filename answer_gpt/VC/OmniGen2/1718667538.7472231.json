    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the tiger mask clearly defined with orange and black stripes arranged in a typical tiger pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mask features distinct orange and black stripes that align with the classical pattern seen on a tiger's face. These stripes add character and are visually recognizable as traditional tiger markings. Thus, the tiger mask is clearly defined with this stripe arrangement.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are pink cherry blossoms with black branch outlines visible on the kimono?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral design on the kimono includes yellow and orange flowers instead of pink cherry blossoms. The visual pattern seen does not include black branch outlines associated with cherry blossoms. Thus, the pattern does not match cherry blossoms.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the tiger mask show an open mouth with visible fangs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger mask displays a closed mouth with no visible fangs. Unlike real-life or artistic masks that may depict open mouths with detailed teeth features, this design does not include such details.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a red obi with horizontal bands wrapped around the waist of the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red obi in Image B features vertical elements more prominently, but its overall design includes horizontal bands typically wrapped around the waist. This matches the description of having these bands.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject appears upright and facing directly towards the viewer, presenting a symmetrical and frontal pose. This suggests an engaged position rather than seated, focusing directly on the audience.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are pink cherry blossoms hanging from above in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a graphic design with no depth, lack of background elements that suggest perspective like hanging cherry blossoms from above. This artistic rendition is flat without such decoration.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the kimono primarily cream-colored with pink floral patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono is more orange than cream and features yellow and orange flower patterns, differing from the suggested palette of cream and pink. This description does not match what is visible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features black lines marking the edges of both the kimono and obi, showcasing a distinct separation of colors and adding definition. This matches the description accurately.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tiger mask in Image B displays prominently upright ears, and the inner surfaces show orange coloring, typical for stylized or anthropomorphic designs where such color details enhance the mask's character.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q10",
      "question": "Is there white fur surrounding the tiger’s muzzle and cheeks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the mask's facial features are simplified and stylized, white fur does not distinctly surround the muzzle and cheeks. The design is more graphic with a focus on flat colors than textural representation like fur.",
