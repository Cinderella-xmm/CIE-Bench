    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the bear's body shaped with a distinct hump over the shoulders and a broad, muscular back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear is depicted with broad shoulders and back, but the distinct hump is not visible due to the simplified and stylized cartoon depiction of the bear, typical of this artistic representation. The bear's body shape suggests muscularity, but lacks the typical hump found over the shoulders in real bears.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the salmon have a clearly defined forked tail fin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the salmon's tail fin appears simplified, as common in cartoon depictions. While it has a tail fin, it does not exhibit the detailed forked appearance typically seen in real salmon.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the bear’s fur rendered with visible texture and layered shading, showing wetness and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the bear with a flat and simplified fur texture typical of cartoon art, lacking detailed shading or texture that conveys wetness or depth, which would be seen in more realistic or detailed artistic styles.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the salmon colored with a blue-green back and a silvery-white belly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the salmon has a cartoonish appearance with a bright orange and green color, lacking the realistic blue-green and silvery-white coloration typically found in natural salmon.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible water splashes or ripples around the bear’s lower legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include water or splashes around the bear's legs as the bear is standing on land, typical of the unrealistic, stylized cartoon scenery.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the bear have a long, broad snout with visible nostrils and a rounded muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the bear is depicted in a cartoon style which simplifies features such as the snout and muzzle. The mouth is present, but the lack of detail means that a broad snout with distinct nostrils is not evident.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the salmon positioned horizontally in the bear’s mouth, with its head protruding forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show the bear holding a salmon horizontally in its mouth. The context is different where the salmon journey is depicted separately in a river, without direct interaction with the bear.",
      "weight": 2,
