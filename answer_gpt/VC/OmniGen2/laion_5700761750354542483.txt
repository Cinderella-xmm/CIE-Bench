    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the butterfly’s four-winged structure with two large upper wings and two smaller lower wings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is depicted with two large wings on its upper side and two smaller wings on its lower side, which is typical for a butterfly's structure. This configuration matches the common anatomy of butterflies, where they have four distinct wings.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the butterfly depicted with symmetrical wings on both sides?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a butterfly with symmetrical wings on either side of its central body. Each pair of wings on the left mirrors the pair on the right in shape and size, which is consistent with typical butterfly symmetry in nature.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a visible central body connecting the wings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a central part of the butterfly that connects the wings and acts as the body. This component can be seen as distinct and anchoring the wings in place, a common characteristic making the wings functional.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a loop or attachment point at the top of the butterfly’s head?",
    "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B features a decorative loop above its central body and head region, similar to attachment points found on ornamental items for hanging or display purposes, such as brooches or ornaments.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the butterfly positioned with wings fully spread in a flat, horizontal orientation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's wings are displayed in a wide-open position, laying flat and horizontally, indicating a display orientation commonly used for visual emphasis in jewelry or decorative pieces.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the wings proportionally larger than the body, matching the original scale?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wings are significantly larger in proportion compared to the central body of the butterfly, which matches the typical representation seen in butterfly anatomy, where wings are dominant in size relative to the body.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do the upper wings have a pointed tip and curved outer edge?",
    "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B displays upper wings that have a pointed tip and exhibit a curved outer edge, reflecting a typical design that enhances aerodynamic and visual appeal, often found in butterfly replicas or jewelry.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Are the lower wings visibly smaller and more rounded than the upper wings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the design of the butterfly includes lower wings that are noticeably smaller and take on a more rounded shape compared to the larger, more angular upper wings—a common feature in the wing structure of butterflies.",
    "answer": "Yes"
