      "question": "Is the large circular rose window located above the central portal and featuring intricate radial tracery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The second image (Image B) depicts a model of a cathedral-like structure inside a display case. A central circular feature is visible above the central portal, resembling a clock rather than a traditional rose window typically found in gothic architecture. Gothic rose windows are characterized by intricate tracery and glasswork. In contrast, the circular feature in Image B has simpler details and serves as a clock, evident from the presence of clock hands. Thus, the characteristic radial tracery of a rose window is absent.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there three distinct arched entrances at the base of the façade, arranged symmetrically with the central one being the largest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the model shows three arched entrances at the base similar to those found in traditional cathedral façades. Each entrance is visually distinguished, and the central one is larger than the two on either side, providing a symmetrical arrangement. Common in gothic architecture is the design of a larger, central entrance flanked by two smaller ones, a pattern visible in the model's representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there two tall, slender spires positioned symmetrically at the outer edges of the central gable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the model structure features two prominent spires on either side of the central gable. These spires are designed to mimic those on gothic cathedrals, being slender and tall, and are symmetrically placed relative to the central gable. The spires are visually consistent with a traditional gothic architectural style.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the façade symmetrically balanced around a central vertical axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The structure depicted in Image B is designed symmetrically. The edges, spires, and entrances are mirror images across the vertical central axis. This symmetric design is consistent with gothic architectural principles, where balance and symmetry are emphasized for aesthetic and structural reasons.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible intricate stone carvings, including tracery, pinnacles, and sculptural details, across the façade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure shows detailed artistry resembling intricate stonework, akin to gothic architecture. However, it's essential to note that these details are representative of a model design rather than actual stone carvings. The visible features such as tracery and pinnacles echo those found on gothic cathedrals, although simplified for model purposes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there flying buttresses extending from the sides of the nave toward the exterior walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The model in Image B does not exhibit flying buttresses, which are architectural elements used traditionally in cathedrals to distribute weight. The absence of such features, which typically extend from the outer walls to the upper parts of a cathedral, indicates that these are not included in the side detailing of the model structure.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {

      "question": "Is there a triangular gable directly above the central rose window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, wihere the intricate gable structure is positioned. The design includes a triangular gable part of the central architectural composition, located directly above the central circular clock feature, which replaces the rose window's typical place, resonating with traditional gothic structures' design elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays numerous slender pinnacles adorning both the central and side sections of the roofline. These features are characteristic of gothic architecture, contributing to the vertical emphasis and decorative complexity of the style seen in this model.",
