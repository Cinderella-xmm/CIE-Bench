      "question": "Is the central tower of the fortress composed of multiple stacked, progressively smaller rectangular tiers forming a stepped pyramid shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fortress has a simplified and stylized architecture, resembling a toy or model rather than an actual fortress. The central tower seems to consist of a single tiered structure with a conical top, rather than multiple rectangular tiers forming a stepped pyramid shape. This design lacks the architectural complexity to represent a stepped pyramid shape common in some traditional fortresses. By analyzing the shape and design of the tower in Image B, it is evident that it does not match the requirements of the question.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there regular, alternating tooth-like projections (crenellations) along the upper edges of the fortress walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fortress features stylized battlements that represent crenellations with regular, alternating tooth-like projections along the upper edges of the walls. This is visible in the segmented appearance at the tops of the walls, which is a common architectural feature in fortress design for defensive purposes. The visual simplicity matches the typical look of crenellations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a prominent arched opening located at the lower front section of the fortress, serving as a main entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stylized and simplified model of a fortress with a prominent arched opening at the lower front section. This design signifies a main entrance, following the typical portrayal of entrances on toy or model castles. The entrance is centrally located and clearly visible, matching the description given in the question.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the waterfall originate from a gap in the cliff face directly beneath the fortress wall and cascade downward into the river below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waterfall is depicted as emerging from a rectangular opening at the base of the fortress. It flows onto the green surface, designed to represent a river path, rather than cascading from a cliff face. Image B represents a toy or cake-like design that simplifies and stylizes natural and architectural elements, depicting a controlled water flow which is not cascading over rocks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the fortress situated on a raised cliff overlooking a river that flows through a narrow canyon below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fortress does not appear to be situated on a realistic geographical feature like a raised cliff or a narrow canyon. Instead, it is presented in a simplified, creative form on a plate, with a blue ribbon representing the water flowing from the fortressâ€™s base. There is no indication of a cliff or canyon environment, typical of this stylized representation.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are clusters of green shrubs and trees visible along the canyon walls and riverbanks surrounding the fortress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a highly stylized, ornamental scenery with simplified elements. The design includes artificial representations of trees beside the fortress, standing on a smooth, flat green surface. These abstractions are not naturally forming shrubs or trees as typically seen in natural canyon environments but are decorative elements meant to enhance the artistic model.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the fortress have a solid rectangular base with vertical walls and corner towers supporting the upper levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In analyzing Image B, the fortress model has a solid, singular structural form with curved towers without distinct vertical corner towers or a rectangular base. Its features and proportions represent a stylized, playful version of a fortress rather than a realistic architectural design.",
