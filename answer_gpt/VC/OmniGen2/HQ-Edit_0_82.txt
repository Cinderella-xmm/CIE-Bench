    "Question": "Q1: Is the elderly man in a tai chi stance with his right leg bent in a lunge, left leg raised behind him, right hand forming an 'ok' gesture near his face, and left hand resting at his waist?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the man is standing with legs and arms positioned similar to tai chi movements; however, neither leg is raised behind him as they are both firmly grounded. His right knee is bent, but his stance resembles more of a horse stance than a lunge. His right hand forms an 'ok' gesture near his face, while the left hand is not resting at the waist but is raised outward. Combining this visual information with world knowledge of tai chi stances helps determine the accuracy of the posture described.",
