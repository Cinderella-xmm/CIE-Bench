    "Question": "Q1: Are both corner towers with domed roofs and weather vanes present and positioned at the upper corners of the structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the structure appears to be a miniature castle under a glass dome. The visible corner towers are equipped with pointy roofs resembling spires rather than domes, which is a different architectural element. Hence, these aren't traditional corner towers as seen in historical buildings. Comparing to Image A, which has traditional corner towers with domed roofs, Image B lacks these features.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the crenellated parapet running along the top edge of the tower intact and continuous?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a small scale miniature castle. The design lacks a recognizably continuous crenellated parapet, which is a defensive feature typically found in medieval architecture structures like the one in Image A. Crenellated parapets typically have a tooth-like appearance, but Image B does not display this architectural feature.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the arched windows arranged symmetrically across the façade, including the triplet groupings above the main level?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the windows of the miniature castle appear to be symmetrically arranged, fitting a common design for such models. However, the presence of triplet groupings above the main level is not clear, as the design seems simplified compared to a real building façade. Without distinct triplet groupings, it fails the specific criteria regarding window arrangements seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a central arched entrance at ground level, directly beneath the central section of the façade, with a wooden drawbridge structure extending forward?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the entrance of the miniature castle is central on the lower level and features a staircase, but it lacks a wooden drawbridge extending forward. There’s a more ceremonial-looking path leading up. Comparing with Image A, which does have a practical wooden structure extending from the entrance, Image B does not feature a drawbridge, thus differing substantially.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there horizontal bands of alternating light and dark stone visible across the exterior walls?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature castle does not display distinct horizontal bands of alternating light and dark stone. Its walls are relatively uniform in color and do not mimic the historic look of alternating stone bricks. This detail is prominent in Image A, showcasing a historic style with varied masonry work, absent in the artificial design of Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the tower maintain a tall, rectangular mass with two prominent corner towers projecting outward?",
    "explanation": "Image B's design features a compact, symmetrical castle model rather than a traditional tower. While there are corner extensions, they are more aligned with fairytale castle spires, differing from the tall, rectangular mass and projecting towers seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the wooden drawbridge constructed with a crisscross lattice pattern of beams?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not have a wooden drawbridge at all, as stated in previous answers; instead, it has a paved path with steps leading to the entrance. In contrast, Image A displays a wooden drawbridge with a crisscross lattice pattern, making this a clear difference between the two images.",
    "answer": "No"
