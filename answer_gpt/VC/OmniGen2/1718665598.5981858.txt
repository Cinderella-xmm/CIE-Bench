    "Question": "Q1: Is there a long, continuous road-like structure extending into the distance, serving as the central axis of the composition?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a pattern and color scheme that suggests a road. This is observed through the central gray and yellow geometric designs that resemble the surface of a road extending toward the horizon, where the parallel lines mimic the perspective of a road disappearing into the distance. Such use of geometric forms creates the visual perception of a road-like feature. As this is a predominant and continuous feature extending centrally in the artwork, it serves as the primary axis of the composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are there visible diagonal streaks or patterns indicating falling rain across the scene?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a geometric abstraction with no indication of rain. The scene comprises solid shapes with blocks of color and no transparent or intersecting diagonal lines that would suggest rain. The art style doesn't incorporate the intricate detailing necessary to depict rain streaks. This interpretation relies on the visual contrast with typical rainy depictions.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there tall vertical structures with horizontal crossbars positioned along the right side of the road?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are simplified representations of tall, vertical structures on the right side of the supposed road. These structures include elements that resemble horizontal arms or crossbars, indicative of utility poles. These elements are depicted in a stylized manner consistent with artistic interpretations of such structures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there tree-like forms present on both sides of the road, aligned with the guardrails?",
    "explanation": "Image B contains abstract representations of trees on both sides of the road. These are depicted as simplified, triangular or conical shapes aligned with the guardrails, echoing the typical arrangement of trees along roadsides. Their positioning and form in the composition suggest tree-like structures, even in the context of abstract art.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a visible division in the sky between dark clouds and a brighter, illuminated area near the horizon?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is portrayed with large geometric shapes and color blocks but does not visibly illustrate a typical sky with a division between dark clouds and a brightly illuminated horizon. The abstract style omits the conventional depiction of cloud formations and light gradations. Thus, the absence of such a division is evident in this stylized rendition.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there barrier-like structures running along both edges of the road?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays elements resembling barriers along the road edges, shown as continuous lines paralleling the road's path. These lines mimic the function and position of road guardrails, which typically exist to delineate road boundaries. This visual representation aligns with the placement of barrier-like structures in both abstract and realistic compositions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is there a continuous yellow line running down the center of the road?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the center of the road features a pattern blending yellow and other geometric shapes, suggesting the presence of a yellow line as part of the abstract design. However, it doesn't form a continuous, uninterrupted line characteristic of a road center marking. The artistic interpretation relies on fragmented geometric inserts rather than standard road line depiction.",
    "answer": "No"
