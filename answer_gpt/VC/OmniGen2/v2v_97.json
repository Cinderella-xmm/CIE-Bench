      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bag character maintains its earthy tones and brown leather straps. The visual cues in the edited image show consistency with a realistic portrayal of the original bag's color scheme, aligning with common design elements seen in such items. Earthy tones convey a natural and subdued look, while leather straps are a typical feature for durability and style in bags.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structural design of the bag, including stitching details, is preserved. The visual representation in the edited image shows the bag with clear stitching lines, which are typical for reinforcing seams in bags and providing a detailed, realistic look consistent with the original design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bowl character does not retain the original white color and shape. Instead, the bowl is represented as a simplified, stylized form resembling a pet dish with edited features, deviating from the initial white ceramic appearance seen in Image A, where the simple shape is typical for bowls.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden floor is present in the background of both manga panels. The visual cues in the edited image portray a wooden flooring setting that matches common indoor settings seen in residential homes or spaces, providing consistency with the environment seen in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "In both panels, is the bag character positioned near the bowl character, similar to their original placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of the bag character in relation to the bowl character is not consistent with the original placement. From the visual evidence, the manga scenes have the objects in varied interactive poses rather than maintaining the static position seen in Image A. This reflects the narrative design choices often employed in manga to create dynamic scenes.",
