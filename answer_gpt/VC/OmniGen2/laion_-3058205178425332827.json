      "question": "Is the bell tower with a domed roof and two arched windows clearly visible and structurally intact in the edited image?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bell tower is still present and recognizable, featuring a domed roof and two arched windows.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a dark mountain in the background with a distinct peak, similar to the one in Image A, but the presence of a new character and text could affect the perception. However, the mountain is still discernible behind these added elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the docks and harbor structures are less distinct due to the changes made by adding a character and text at the top. The vibrant depiction is obscured but recognizable, except for the elements covered by new additions, impacting the clarity.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the red-tiled rooftops and their warm tones in the foreground. The added cartoon character does not affect these areas, allowing the original coloration to visibly remain.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky maintains a similar pink and purple gradient as in Image A, capturing the evening ambiance. Despite the overlay of text and graphics, the gradient effect transitions smoothly toward the horizon, with blue tones visible over the sea.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
