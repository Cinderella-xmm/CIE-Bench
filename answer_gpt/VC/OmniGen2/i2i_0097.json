    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the plate retain its circular shape and raised rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a circular plate is visible, with an evident raised rim which is consistent with the common design of plates. This suggests the plate retains its original shape and physical attributes, as typically plates possess these features for functional design purposes.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the plate still white in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plate is clearly depicted as white, matching its typical color associated with porcelain or ceramic dining plates. This observation is derived directly from its appearance where no color alteration can be seen on the plate itself.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the spoon retain its metallic finish and reflective surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a spoon with a metallic surface that reflects light, characteristic of stainless steel or similar materials commonly used for cutlery. The shine and reflective properties displayed confirm the retention of its metallic finish.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the spoon still oriented vertically on the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spoon is placed lengthwise along the vertical axis of the plate, with the handle pointing towards the bottom and the bowl pointing towards the top of the image. This positioning aligns perfectly with the vertical orientation mentioned.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the plate and spoon still centrally positioned in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows both the plate and spoon centered horizontally in the composition. This placement suggests a deliberate choice for symmetry and balance, remaining unchanged from common positional habits seen in similar settings where adequate visual impact or focus is desired.",
