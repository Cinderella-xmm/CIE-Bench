      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central rock formation has been transformed into a stylized illustration with a slightly altered shape and texture. Although its distinctive vertical form is maintained, the texture appears more smooth and animated compared to the more realistic and rugged details of Image A. This implies that while the core shape is preserved, the texture is not. Considering visual cues and the differences in representation from realistic to artistic styles, the distinctive texture is not entirely retained.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not have the rolling green hills and mountainous background that is present in Image A. Instead, it features a stylized illustration with elements like text and graphics surrounding the rock, eliminating the landscape elements entirely. The absence of landscape features implies the background is not present. Drawing on visual cues and comparing both images, it is clear that the edited version lacks the natural environment depicted originally.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a stylized illustration with uniform lighting across the rock formation and additional graphic elements, lacking any natural landscape such as hills and mountains. The absence of landscape and the uniform lighting suggest that the lighting and shadow effects depicted in the original Image A are not retained. Based on visual cues and style transformation from realism to illustration, these effects are absent in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not showcase any hills or mountains as seen in Image A. It instead focuses on a singular stylized illustration of the rock with added graphics. Since the contours and coloration of the landscape elements are missing and replaced by artistic representation, they are not consistent with the original image. Using world knowledge on landscape depiction and the change to artistic elements, it is clear these elements are absent.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B maintains the rock formation as the central focus; however, the surrounding landscape is transformed into an illustrative element, without the rolling hills and background. While the creature is in a central position like in Image A, without the background landscape, its position in relation to nonexistent natural elements cannot be maintained. Based on comparison of central focus across images, but lack of background in the edited version, its relative positioning is altered.",
