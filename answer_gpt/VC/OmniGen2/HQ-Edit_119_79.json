      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the calico pattern of orange, black, and white patches preserved in the same spatial arrangement across the catâ€™s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the calico pattern is present with orange, black, and white patches on the cat's body. However, the spatial arrangement of these colors does not perfectly match the natural, random distribution seen in real calico cats or in Image A. Instead, the pattern appears more stylized and distinct, resembling a design rather than an organic distribution. Thus, the spatial arrangement of the pattern differs from the natural appearance, leading to the conclusion based on typical calico cat patterns.",

      "question": "Are the eyes still green and positioned symmetrically in the center of the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes of the cat are green and symmetrically positioned in the center of the face. This is consistent with how eyes are typically depicted, allowing the viewer to understand these facial features as symmetrical and centered. Comparing Image A and Image B, both images show green eyes with symmetrical positioning, affirming this trait's continuity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cat in an upright seated position with both front paws placed directly in front of the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the cat in an upright seated position with both front paws placed directly in front of its body. This is a common pose for seated cats, showing a sense of balance and symmetry. Analyzing this posture in Image A and Image B reveals that while both show the upright seated position, the edited Image B maintains the alignment of the paws directly in front, similar to Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the pink nose present at the center of the face, surrounded by white fur on the muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat features a pink nose positioned centrally on its face, surrounded by white fur on the muzzle, which is typical for many cat illustrations. Visual analysis confirms the central placement surrounded by white fur. Comparing both images shows the preservation of this feature consistently across the two depictions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the cat seated on a vertical wooden block that supports its full weight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is not depicted on a vertical wooden block but rather on a pedestal resembling a base or platform, which does not mimic the wooden block in Image A. Image A shows the cat fully supported by a tree stump-like wooden structure, while Image B transitions to a stylized pedestal, thus altering the seating surface.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the tail curled to the right side and displaying alternating orange and black bands consistent with the body pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show the tail in a curled position to the right side and lacks the alternating orange and black bands pattern seen in natural calico tails. Instead, the representation in Image B focuses more on geometric and symmetrical features, excluding such specific tail characteristics. In comparison, Image A displays such a natural tail curl and color pattern, confirming the absence of these details in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both ears are upright and pointed forward, symmetrically placed on the top of the head, which signifies attention typical in cat behavior. Comparing this characteristic with Image A, both images maintain the symmetry and upright position of the ears, ensuring continuity in the cat's alert posture.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat does display a large white fluffy area on the chest extending from the neck down to the front paws, similar to typical chest fur observed in cats. Reviewing this trait in both Image A and Image B confirms the continuity of this characteristic, reflecting a natural pattern often seen in cats.",
