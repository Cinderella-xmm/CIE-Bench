      "question": "Does the handbag retain the organic, wood-like texture seen in the original brain sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brain sculpture exhibits a more glossy and smooth texture, which appears artificial and lacks the organic, wood-like texture visible in Image A. In Image A, the sculpture closely resembles a carved wooden texture, with visible grain and depth, characteristics typical of natural wood. This observation suggests that Image B does not maintain the organic feel of the original.",

      "question": "Is the handbag designed with an earthy color palette, including shades of brown and beige?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays colors that include beige and light brown tones reminiscent of an earthy palette. By examining these color variations, particularly the golden-brown mix, it can be asserted that the amended design uses an earthy color palette similar to dirt or sand shades. Image A also reveals similar natural color tones, confirming that both images employ this palette.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The phrase 'profound musings' appears in both Image A and Image B, positioned on the sculpture's left hemisphere and featuring a similar cursive font style. This consistent placement and typography connect both images and affirm that Image B retains the original inscription style and location.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features detailed grooves that replicate the brain's sulci and gyri patterns, present in Image A. Although the textures and materials differ, the visual complexity and structural detailing in Image B resemble those carved patterns seen in Image A, confirming a replication of the intricate original design.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture is mounted on a wooden base identical to the one in Image A. Both bases are similar in their rectangular shape and wooden appearance, serving as a supporting structure. Thus, the handbag design includes the wooden base seen in the original design.",
