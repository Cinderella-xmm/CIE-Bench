      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the bird's eye clearly visible with a dark blue iris, black pupil, and a thin white orbital ring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eye of the bird is cartoon-like, characterized by a single large black pupil without a distinctive iris or orbital ring as found in more realistic depictions. It has an exaggerated and simplistic design meant for storytelling or illustrative purposes, likely to resonate with younger audiences. The colors are bright and the details are less nuanced compared to realistic representations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the bird have a short, conical beak that is pale pinkish-gray with a dark tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird has a cartoon-styled beak, which is depicted in a simple manner with a uniform color and lacks the specific detail of pale pinkish-gray or a dark tip. Cartoon designs often simplify features and emphasize certain aspects for clarity and visual appeal. Such details are minimized in this style, focusing more on the simplified and engaging characteristics rather than realistic hues.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the bird’s feathers visibly fluffy and layered, with warm earthy tones including tan, brown, and reddish crown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's feathers are drawn simply, without the realistic layering or fluffiness found in real feathers. The colors are distinct, but they are used more flatly for illustrative effect common in cartoons. The emphasis is on clear, recognizable color usage rather than realistic texture or depth, aiming for a style that is visually straightforward for storytelling.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bird’s tail feathers extend downward in a long, narrow, layered shape with natural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tail feathers of the bird are designed in a flat, cartoon style with minimal layering or natural shading seen in realistic images. This design choice aligns with the playful and simplified aesthetic typical of illustration meant for adventure or narrative themes, rather than aiming for naturalistic detail.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the bird’s feet visible with claws gripping the branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird’s feet are visible. They appear stylized as flat figures with no claws, gripping an implied path rather than a branch, aligning with the adventure and treasure map theme. This design choice prioritizes clarity and simplicity over realism, focusing on cartoon narrative elements.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Is the bird positioned upright on the branch, facing slightly to the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is depicted upright suggesting forward movement on a path. It faces straight ahead rather than slightly to the left, as it is engaged in a themed adventure setting. The orientation in this image supports storytelling imagery, rather than strict anatomical depiction.",
      "weight": 2,

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no green moss depicted as the setting reflects a cartoon map background rather than a natural scene with a branch supporting moss growth. This stylistic choice reflects the intended adventure theme, focusing on elements like treasure and exploration paths rather than detailed nature illustration.",
