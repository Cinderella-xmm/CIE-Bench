    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image contain exactly six labeled process stages corresponding to the CRISP-DM phases?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed six labeled process stages surrounding a central data source. However, the text of each stage is scrambled, e.g., 'Pusinerstngiing' and 'Eepleoetting'. Despite this jumbled presentation, the image is intended to represent CRISP-DM phases.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the six stages arranged in the correct sequential order: Business Understanding → Data Understanding → Data Preparation → Modeling → Evaluation → Deployment → back to Business Understanding?",
    "explanation": "The phases in Image B are not arranged in the correct sequential order as recognized in the CRISP-DM methodology. The stages are scrambled and placed in seemingly random order, which does not align with the standard sequence.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a bidirectional connection (e.g., two-way path or mutual interaction) between the 'Business Understanding' and 'Data Understanding' stages?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bidirectional connection is not evidently presented between 'Business Understanding' and 'Data Understanding' due to the scrambled labels and the unclear arrangement of stages. Identifying a two-way path between these specific stages is not feasible based solely on the image's layout.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a bidirectional connection (e.g., two-way path or mutual interaction) between the 'Data Preparation' and 'Modeling' stages?",
    "explanation": "Among the scrambled labels, 'Data Prepnraabing' and 'Deslgng!' presumably correspond to 'Data Preparation' and 'Modeling,' respectively. There appears to be no clear bidirectional path outlined between these two stages, possibly due to the depiction style of Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a central data source located at the center of the diagram, accessible to all six stages?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a central element — a barrel, which serves as the central data source, akin to 'Data' in the CRISP-DM workflow. This central source seems to be accessible to all stages, indicated by the surrounding paths leading to or from it.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the diagram include a clear return path from the 'Deployment' stage back to the 'Business Understanding' stage, completing the cycle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, identifying a clear return path from 'Depllostonent' (presumably 'Deployment') back to 'Pusinerstngiing' ('Business Understanding') is not feasible due to the poorly defined paths between stages. The cycle completion is not visibly depicted.",
    "answer": "No"
