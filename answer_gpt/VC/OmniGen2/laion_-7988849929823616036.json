      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the mustache present with its original shape, including upward curls at the ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit pattern and colorful design draw attention, and there is no visible mustache on the person depicted. Comparing this with the typical visual characteristics of mustaches, especially those with upward curls, reinforces the lack of such a feature in Image B. Therefore, based on these observations, the mustache is not present.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both eyes visible and positioned symmetrically with the bridge of the nose aligned centrally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's no visual indication of the presence of eyes given the blurred area, hence it is impossible to verify the symmetry or alignment pertaining to the eyes or the bridge of the nose.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question": "Is the hairline clearly defined with a receding pattern at the temples?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows distinct, smooth hair with no visible receding pattern at the temples. The defined hairstyle exhibits a modern, slick appearance which contrasts with a receding hairline characteristic. Therefore, the hairline is not receding at the temples.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bow tie is visible at the neck and appears to be centered with a symmetrical knot, which is typical of how bow ties are worn. The visual presentation aligns with the conventional placement of a bow tie under the collar.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible text located below the image. Unlike Image A, which explicitly displays the text \"S. W. Kramer.\", Image B does not contain any text in this area of the composition.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible rectangular border or framing similar to traditional photograph borders. The image's vibrant design extends to the edges without distinct framing as seen in Image A.",
