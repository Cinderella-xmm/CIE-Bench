      "question": "Is the Mustang logo visible and intact on the grille in all views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two distinct views: the side view and the top view of a car. The grille is typically located at the front of the vehicle, which is not visible in the side or top views. Given these perspectives, it's not possible to observe or confirm the presence of the Mustang logo on the grille within Image B. In contrast, Image A shows a front view of a car where a recognizable Mustang logo is visible on the grille. Comparing both images, the absence of a front view in Image B implies the inability to assess the logo's visibility or intactness.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a side view of the car, but lacks any visible GT badge on that view, based on general car design knowledge. Typically, the GT badge is found at the front grille or sides of cars like Ford Mustang, which is shown in Image A. However, in Image B, the visible side view does not feature any such badge.",

      "question": "Are the wheels depicted with the same black multi-spoke design in all views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The side view of Image B shows wheels with a detailed design that appears to be a black multi-spoke design, which is consistent with what the front view of Image A illustrates. The top view in Image B, however, does not offer enough detail to confirm the wheel design due to its angle and perspective. Thus, it does not depict the same black multi-spoke design as clearly seen in other views.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the side and top views in Image B, the car is shown in black and maintains its sleek shape, very similar to the car viewed in Image A, which is also depicted in black with a sleek aerodynamic design. The consistency of color and shape across different angles is evident by comparing both images, supporting that the car's portrayal retains its original characteristics.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the side view shows positions for headlights and exhaust outlets, typical in car design, while the top view does not provide sufficient detail to see these elements accurately. In Image A, the headlights appear accurately placed and designed for a car model like the Mustang. Image B does not provide enough detail in the top perspective to confirm the accuracy of headlights and exhaust outlet placement across all views.",
