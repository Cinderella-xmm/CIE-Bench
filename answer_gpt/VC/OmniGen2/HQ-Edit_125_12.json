      "question": "Is the intricate engraved floral and scrollwork pattern on the teapot body still visible and intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the teapot has been changed to a marble-like appearance with a plain area for the label 'Earl Grey Elegance'. This results in the intricate engraved floral and scrollwork pattern seen in Image A not being visible in Image B. The teapot now features a smooth surface design instead. This change is visually clear as the texture and decorative elements have been altered in the edited image.",

      "question": "Does the teapot retain its rounded body, flared base, and domed lid with finial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot maintains its characteristic rounded body, flared base, and domed lid with a finial on top. These structural elements are consistent with those in Image A, indicating that while some decorative elements have changed, the overall shape and form of the teapot remain the same.",

      "question": "Is the reflective silver-metallic surface of the teapot preserved, showing clear highlights and reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The reflective silver-metallic surface seen in Image A has been altered in Image B to a marble-like material with gold accents. This surface change eliminates the high reflectivity and highlights characteristic of metallic surfaces. The teapot in Image B does not show the same reflective quality as in Image A.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spout and both handles in Image B retain their original positions and curved shapes as observed in Image A. Although the material and color have changed to a gold tone, the design integrity of these components remains consistent in terms of their placement and elegant curvature.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the decorative ridges and edge banding around the lid and base are still present. The teapot's design elements, these ridges, and banding correspond to the traditional style seen in Image A, despite the change in material and color to gold.",
