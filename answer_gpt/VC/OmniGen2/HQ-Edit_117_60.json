    {

      "question": "Are both the main triangular sail and the smaller jib sail present and correctly positioned on the mast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boat features a large triangular sail and a smaller triangular sail, mimicking a common configuration found on sailing vessels where the main sail and the jib sail are correctly positioned. The main triangular sail is mounted vertically from the mast with the smaller jib sail connected similarly but extending forward. This configuration is a typical setup for boats, indicating that both sails are present and correctly positioned.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a single vertical mast located centrally along the length of the boat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a single vertical mast, centrally positioned relative to the length of the boat. The mast supports both sails, typical of small sailing boat designs where a single mast suffices for the number and type of sails.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the boat have a sharply pointed bow extending forward from the hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bow of the boat does not appear sharply pointed; instead, it has a rounded configuration consistent with a decorative or minimalist design in wooden sculptures or models, rather than functionally sharp designs seen in traditional boats meant for cutting through water.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a covered section with open sides and vertical railings located over the midsection of the hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display a covered section with open sides or vertical railings over the midsection of the hull. Instead, the boat is a simplistic, stylized wooden sculpture with no intricate design elements such as a covered deck or railings.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a small red flag attached to the stern of the boat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no indication of a red flag attached to the stern. The design is minimalist, focusing solely on the wooden material and structure without additional elements like flags or decorative items.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the sails, mast, deck, and bow aligned in their original spatial configuration, maintaining the correct proportions and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The configuration in Image B shows the sails and mast aligned with the purpose of a simplified artistic representation, rather than maintaining the exact proportions and orientation for functional sailing as apparent in Image A. Image B's proportions are stylized, crafted to prioritize aesthetics, confirming a rearrangement from the functional design seen in Image A.",
