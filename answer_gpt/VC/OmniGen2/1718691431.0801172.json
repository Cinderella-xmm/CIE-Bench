      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the two upright, pointed ears with black outer edges and pinkish-red inner patterns present on the mask?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mask features two upright, pointed ears. The outer edges are primarily black, and the inner parts have red patterns. This is consistent with the typical design of fox masks often used in cultural imagery, indicating that the ears are a prominent and intentional part of the mask's design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the human eyes clearly visible through the eye openings in the mask?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a mask that has stylized, closed white eye shapes as part of its design. These do not serve as openings for human eyes, but instead, represent the facial characteristics of a fox. The absence of human eye visibility suggests the mask is purely ornamental and not functional in showing human expressions.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the kimono structured with a V-shaped neckline and wide sleeves extending from the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the attire consists of a kimono illustrated with a V-shaped neckline. The representation of the kimono aligns well with traditional Japanese dressing styles due to the crossed V shape at the neck and is commonly found in cultural depictions of fox spirits or mythological beings.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a wide sash (obi) positioned horizontally across the chest, aligned with the center of the kimono?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any distinct, wide sash or obi horizontally across the chest. The kimono design is simpler and decorative, focusing more on the overall aesthetic and color patterns rather than typical clothing accessories.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there three distinct whiskers on each side of the mask, alternating in black and white?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the mask with stylized representation featuring black lines near the mouth that resemble whiskers. However, these are part of the mask's decorative design rather than distinct whiskers that alternate black and white.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the nose positioned centrally below the eyes and shaped as a small black oval, with a faint mouth line beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the mask with a small, centrally positioned black oval shape representing the nose. Beneath this, there is a faint mouth line, coherent with the depiction of a fox or similar creature, designed for aesthetic rather than function.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the overall composition symmetrically balanced along the vertical axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design of Image B features high symmetry along the vertical axis, with both sides of the mask and kimono mirroring each other in terms of color, shape, and design elements, typical in art forms representing mythical creatures.",
