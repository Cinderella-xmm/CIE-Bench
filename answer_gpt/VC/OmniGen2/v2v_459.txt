    "Question": "Q1: Does the left tie retain its diagonal striped pattern in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the left tie features a pattern of stripes arranged diagonally across the tie. This pattern can be identified by observing the alternating stripes of colors running diagonally along the tie's length. Based on world knowledge, a diagonal pattern is characterized by lines or stripes moving at an angle rather than horizontally or vertically. Therefore, Image B shows a diagonal striped pattern on the left tie.",
