      "question": "Are the two symmetrical f-hole shapes present on the body of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object appears to be a violin, which traditionally includes two f-hole shapes on its body. These f-holes are used for sound projection and are typically symmetrical on each side of the violin's body. The edited image shows these classic f-hole shapes, indicating their presence. This is identified through the distinct carved shapes visible on the body of the object that match the traditional design of a violin.",

      "question": "Is the scroll with four tuning pegs located at the top end of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object has a scroll feature typically found at the top end of a violin. The scroll is an ornamental carved wood piece at the top of the violin's neck and often houses four tuning pegs, an essential part of the violin for tension adjustment of the strings. This component is visually similar to a standard violin design and is located at the expected position at the top end.",

      "question": "Does the object retain the classic violin silhouette with distinct upper and lower bouts and a central waist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the object with the characteristic violin silhouette, featuring distinct upper and lower bouts with a curving central waist. This shape is iconic for violins, helping with sound production and ergonomics. The image clearly retains this distinct shape, which is easily identifiable by the curved indents and overall structure of the body.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a clearly defined bridge area located between the two f-holes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bridge is a small wooden piece that typically stands between the two f-holes on a violin. It supports the strings and transmits their vibrations to the body for sound production. The edited image indeed shows this clearly defined bridge area nestled between the f-holes, consistent with the functional design of a violin.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the object positioned diagonally across the support surface, with the scroll pointing toward the upper right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the violin is placed on a support surface in a diagonal orientation, with the scroll end indeed pointing toward the upper right corner of the frame. This placement is visually confirmed by the direction of the neck and scroll, which aligns with the diagonal position on the support structure.",
