    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the structure retain four distinct legs forming a wide base that converge upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower retains its iconic structural design, featuring four strong and distinct legs that form a wide base and converge upward, forming its identifiable shape. This observation is based on the historical design of the Eiffel Tower, known for this specific structural form. The edited image maintains this original architectural characteristic.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the tower’s shape vertically tapered, narrowing progressively from base to spire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the Eiffel Tower gradually tapering as it ascends, starting from a wide base with four legs and narrowing progressively towards the spire. This design is characteristic of the Eiffel Tower, supporting its vertical stability and aesthetic appeal. The perception of tapering from base to peak is clear and adheres to architectural principles.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there three distinct horizontal levels or platforms visible along the tower’s height?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower showcases its three distinct levels or platforms as part of its architectural design. These levels are typically used for observation decks or structural reinforcement. The edited image highlights these platforms visibly and aligns with the original design of the Eiffel Tower.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tower centrally positioned in the image, aligned with the center of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly depicts the Eiffel Tower centrally positioned, accentuating its importance as the focal point of the composition. Given the symmetry and balance typical in landscape photography, especially involving prominent landmarks, the tower's position in the center supports its visual dominance and aesthetic appeal.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a straight, symmetrical pathway extending from the foreground directly toward the base of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a straight, symmetrical pathway leading directly toward the base of the Eiffel Tower. This path directs visual attention and provides a sense of depth and scale while maintaining symmetry in the edited image, conforming to traditional designs in landscape architecture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the light source (sun or equivalent) located directly behind the base of the tower, creating a halo effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a pronounced light source situated directly behind the tower, creating a visually striking halo effect. This positioning enhances the dramatic impact and adds a sense of wonder and grandeur to the scene, suggestive of a setting sun typically associated with such effects.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a visible cityscape in the background, extending horizontally behind the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not exhibit a cityscape extending horizontally behind the tower. Instead, the edited version replaces the typical urban background with a more fantastical sky and accents, signifying a departure from the realistic setting of a cityscape.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the tower significantly taller than all other structures in the image, dominating the vertical space?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the Eiffel Tower prominently towering over any available structures. Its dominance over the vertical space is clear as it is the central focal point with no competing structures in height, abiding by iconic perspectives of the Eiffel Tower.",
