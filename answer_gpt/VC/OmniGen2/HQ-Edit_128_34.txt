    "Question": "Q1: Is the McLaren logo clearly visible on the center of the car's hood?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, which features a small model car within a display case, the McLaren logo is not resolvable on the hood due to the size and the angle. In such depictions, especially with model cars in showcases, brand logos may not be as discernibly detailed as on a real vehicle. Therefore, based on these factors, the logo is not clearly visible in the image.",
