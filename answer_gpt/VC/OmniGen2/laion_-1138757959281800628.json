      "question": "Are the orange vertical support beams still present along the edges of the hotel building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hotel is depicted inside a glass dome with a simplified architectural design, resembling a toy model. The structural details such as orange vertical support beams present in Image A are absent in this miniature version. This indicates that while the building's general silhouette is animatedly mimicked, specific accents like the orange beams are not visually apparent.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the lower part of the hotel building still painted in light blue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B's rendition, the hotel's lower facade appears more as a solid color without specific architectural painting details. While Image A showcases light blue paint on the building's lower part, Image B offers a more generalized light tone, which does not distinctly replicate the original blue paint. This abstraction points towards a missing specific coloring feature in the artistic rendition.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the white columns supporting the ground floor of the hotel still visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire presentation of the hotel within the dome is more toy-like and lacks the real-life architectural details seen in Image A. The specific white columns evident in Image A are not visible in the stylized model depicted in Image B, as the representation does not provide the same structural detailing.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the swimming pool still kidney-shaped in outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the swimming pool has a circular shape within the model setting, contrasting with the kidney-shaped design found in Image A. This shows a transformation in the pool's design from an organically shaped large pool to a simple round structure within the realm of miniaturization.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the blue sun loungers still arranged around the perimeter of the pool?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a scaled-down and abstracted version of a hotel pool environment where specific items, such as sun loungers, are portrayed as simplified colored figures or shapes. Despite including a concept of relaxation around the pool, the clear row of blue sun loungers from Image A is not visible, as the artistic change de-emphasizes detailed furnishing.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the green-and-white striped umbrellas still visible near the poolside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The miniature setting of Image B replaces detailed accessories like green-and-white striped umbrellas from Image A with generalized scenery. Within the model, the absence of these distinct poolside amenities confirms a departure from the specifics of outdoor furnishing as initially featured.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there still people visible sunbathing on loungers or swimming in the pool?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows figures, more like toy or clay models, positioned around the pool, suggesting human presence similar to those seen relaxing around or in the pool in Image A. Although their appearance is heavily abstracted, this suggests that Image B maintains the notion of people sunbathing and enjoying the poolside.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the swimming pool still positioned directly in front of the hotel building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the general layout wherein the swimming pool is positioned directly in front of the hotel structure, mimicking the spatial arrangement seen in Image A. The placement of the circular pool in front of the miniaturized building showcases consistency in overall spatial design, despite the abstraction in style.",
