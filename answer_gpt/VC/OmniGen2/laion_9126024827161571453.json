      "question": "Are the battery tops rendered in copper color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tops of the batteries are depicted in a copper color, which is consistent with the common design of Duracell batteries. The visual representation shows a distinct copper hue that aligns with typical battery top colors associated with Duracell products.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the word \"DURACELL\" printed vertically in white on the black body of each battery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a brand name similar to 'DURACELL' is printed vertically in white on the black body of each battery. However, the text appears to be mirrored or unintelligible (e.g., 'DIWEU'), which suggests alterations that depart from the standard 'DURACELL' text seen in battery marketing and packaging.",

      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question": "Is there a silver band near the base of each battery with the word \"DURALOCK\" inscribed on it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible silver band near the base of each battery, nor is the word 'DURALOCK' inscribed on any part of the batteries. The lack of this specific design feature indicates a departure from the typical Duracell battery design found in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B does not contain the phrase '10 Years in Storage.' The absence of this text suggests a deviation from typical product packaging or marketing claims seen in Image A, where such information would be visibly highlighted.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are four battery-inspired characters depicted. Visual cues show the outline and color patterning of batteries arranged to create the imagery of characters or objects inspired by batteries, matching the specified count of four.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brand name 'DURACELL' is indeed displayed in large, bold letters at the top of the image. This matches common branding practices where the brand name is prominently featured at the top for visibility and recognition.",
