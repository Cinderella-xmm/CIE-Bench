        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues available in the edited image, the man's face is not visible due to a blurred area covering that part. Therefore, it is impossible to ascertain any expressions or distinct features. Thus, the image does not retain these elements.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
