      "question": "Is the red football with white laces present in the quilt’s design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quilt’s design is clearly visible and there are geometric shapes that resemble Lego bricks arranged in a colorful pattern. Upon close examination, there is no red football with white laces visible. My understanding of a football is a brown or red elongated spherical shape with characteristic white laces, none of which appear in the quilt design of Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, amidst the colored squares, there is a black-and-white pattern identifiable as a soccer ball with hexagonal patterns. The soccer ball is synonymous with a pattern of black pentagons and white hexagons, which is distinctly present in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, which predominantly features blocks of primary colors mimicking Lego, there are no visible designs resembling an orange basketball with characteristic black lines, which distinguish a basketball design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B’s quilt design, there is no depiction of a white circular object resembling a baseball. A baseball typically features red stitching, which isn’t present in this largely abstract pattern of colored squares.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B shows a quilt composed of colored squares arranged in a patchwork pattern. Each square mimics the appearance of Lego bricks, forming a grid in various colors, clearly indicating a patchwork design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quilt features a vibrant pattern of colored squares and Lego brick designs; however, there are no blue and white stars adorning the quilt. The absence of stars is noticeable when closely inspecting the design elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the sports balls positioned in the same relative locations within the patchwork grid as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B reveals that the sports balls are not positioned similarly. Image A features various sports balls like soccer balls, basketballs, and footballs in specific positions within the patchwork pattern. In contrast, Image B’s design is largely abstract with blocks resembling Lego pieces, with no adherence to the specific positions of sports balls from Image A's pattern.",
