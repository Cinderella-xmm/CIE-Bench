    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the man’s long curly hair tied into a low ponytail present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is depicted in a cartoon-like chibi style as a figurine. The representation of hair in chibi figures often simplifies features, and he has short hair styled in a neat, cartoonish manner, not a long, tied ponytail, which is common in this type of design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a silver hoop earring visible in the man’s left ear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is illustrated as a chibi cartoon, where small details like jewelry can sometimes be omitted for stylistic simplicity. In this case, there's no visible earring on the figurine.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the woman have a long black braid over her right shoulder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, as a stylized chibi figurine, she has a long black braid, but it hangs straight down behind her and does not rest over her right shoulder.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the woman’s lips colored pink?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a chibi figure with simplified facial features without specific lip color details. Chibi designs often do not emphasize lip color to retain a simpler, universal facial structure.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do both individuals wear shirts of the same pinkish-red color with a white dot pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figures are shown wearing clothing that appears similar in color. The man's shirt resembles the described pattern more closely, but artistic liberties may adjust exact colors and patterns in chibi interpretations to minimize details while maintaining resemblance.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the woman’s hands placed on the man’s shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both figures are posed with hands on their hips, showing attention to the typical chibi-style design that highlights simple poses, instead of interactive placements like hands on shoulders.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the man have a full beard and mustache?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates chibi characters, where complex facial features, such as beards or mustaches, are usually omitted for stylistic preference. The man in Image B does not show any facial hair.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Do both individuals wear dark gray pants?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower section of the figures is shown in a darker color than their shirts, consistent with dark gray pants. This simplicity aligns with chibi characterization, where dark clothing items are often depicted in muted tones.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
