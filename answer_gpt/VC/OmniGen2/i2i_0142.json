        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom-right view of the glove shows a detailed tan leather texture and black stitching, similar to a realistic baseball glove known for these characteristic features.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining the two baseballs depicted in the top row of Image B reveals white spheres with prominent red stitching. This representation is consistent with typical baseball design standards, where baseballs are often white with red stitching for enhanced visibility and grip.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction of two baseballs and two gloves in Image B shows depth and perspective that maintain the three-dimensional nature of these objects. The placement of shadows and highlights is aligned with realistic 3D shapes, such as the spherical aspect of the baseballs and the curved structure of the glove.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the baseballs and gloves on a plain white background with no indication of a grass-like texture beneath the glove. The absence of environmental context does not suggest a setting associated with the typical outdoor baseball scene involving grass.",
