      "question": "Is the horse depicted with its original white coat and blonde mane and tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse has a white coat with a blonde mane and tail. This combination was also described for Image A, indicating that the horse's coloration has not been altered. This consistency supports the conclusion that the horse's coat and hair colors remain original.",

      "question": "Does the horse retain its posture of being in mid-gait?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is clearly depicted in a dynamic pose, with one front leg raised and the other hind leg ready to take step, indicating motion typical of a mid-gait stance. This posture is visually similar to the horse shown in Image A, suggesting that the posture has been retained.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the horse's original hooves visible and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's hooves are visible and appear in a natural state, without any artificial modifications or alterations. Image A also showed these visible and realistic details, indicating no change to their appearance between the two images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body proportions in Image B appear to reflect natural equine anatomy, with proportionate head, neck, limbs, and torso. Since Image A displayed a similar natural horse form based on its description, we can deduce that the proportions have not been altered in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the horse's eyes and facial expression unaltered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the horse with a typical equine facial expression, characterized by bright and alert eyes, consistent with common depictions of horses. Since no changes have been described in Image A, the eyes and expressions in both images have likely been left unaltered.",
