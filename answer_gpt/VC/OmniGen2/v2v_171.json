      "question": "Are the child’s eyes almond-shaped with dark brown irises and a visible light reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi style character has very simplified features, including large round eyes typical of chibi art style. The eyes are exaggerated in size and do not have the intricate details such as almond shape or specific iris coloring that would be visible in a realistic representation. This style typically includes a glossy reflection to indicate a light source because it enhances the cuteness factor. Based on these visual cues and style conventions, the figure does not have almond-shaped eyes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the child’s hair light brown and styled in a low ponytail with loose strands around the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character has hair depicted in a simplified, chibi style. The hair appears to be dark in color rather than light brown, and it is styled neatly without a clear ponytail or loose strands, which is typical in such styles for simplicity and cuteness. The character's hairstyle is not designed to emulate realism.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the child wear a short-sleeved, rust-colored t-shirt with a round neckline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character is shown wearing a t-shirt that is similar in style to the original in Image A. It is short-sleeved and rust-colored with a round neckline. This matches the description provided and is consistent with the simplified depiction required by the chibi art style.",
      "weight": 2,

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the child’s pants blue denim jeans?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pants of the character are depicted as blue, which aligns with typical blue denim jeans. Although details like texture cannot be visualized as denim due to the stylized nature of the art, the color and form are consistent with blue jeans.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the child sitting cross-legged with her hands clasped between her knees?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character is shown sitting cross-legged. However, the hands are not clasped between the knees; instead, the hands are holding a tablet which is common in toy representations to depict engagement in an activity.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the child’s gaze directed toward the tablet on the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character’s eyes suggest an engagement with something directly ahead, which is typically how engagement is depicted in such styles, but there is no tablet on a table. The tablet is being held, so the gaze is rather towards the tablet they are holding rather than one on a table.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a black tablet placed on a small wooden table in front of the child?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the box design might hint at a setup like a display with the character holding a tablet, but lacks the presence of a separate wooden table visually depicted in front of the character. The tablet is illustrated in the character's hands.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the child barefoot with no footwear on her feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figurine’s feet are not explicitly depicted; however, figures like this often end in simple, undefined shapes. Given the stylized nature without explicitly drawn shoes or visible footwear, it’s inconclusive to say the character is barefoot.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Is the floor and table made of light-colored wood with visible grain patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the context of a table or floor material is not depicted in the typical setting of a chibi-style toy or illustration. The background is abstract, without detailed environmental context like wood grains or specific material depiction. Therefore, the question cannot be confirmed within the scope of the image.",
