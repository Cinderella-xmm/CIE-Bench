    "Question": "Q1: Is the central dome present and positioned directly above the main structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, there is a prominent dome featured on top of the building structure. It is centrally positioned, indicating that it is directly above the main structure. The dome has a rounded, spherical shape which is commonly associated with classical architectural designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a golden star located at the very top of the dome’s spire?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a dome with a blunt, rounded top and does not feature any spire or the detailing usually seen in traditional architecture or decorations such as a golden star. The dome is smooth and unadorned at its peak.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the windows arranged in a symmetrical grid pattern across the building’s front face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the windows are circular and evenly distributed across the front face of the building, but they do not follow the grid pattern typical of traditional architecture. They are placed systematically, but not symmetrically in a grid format; instead, they appear to complement the decorative style of a gingerbread house.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a row of vertical columns forming a portico at the ground level of the building’s front?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a gingerbread house style building which does not have vertical columns at the ground level. Instead, it has decorative elements more akin to frosting or design typical of gingerbread houses rather than the structural columns used in classical architectural porticos.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there two large trees with golden-yellow foliage positioned symmetrically on both sides of the building?",
    "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B feature trees positioned on either side of a central structure. In Image B, the edited image features stylized trees resembling decorations, but they do maintain a symmetrical positioning around the gingerbread structure. The trees are crafted elements, which are symmetrical.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a straight paved road running in front of the building, parallel to its base?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no paved road depicted in front of the structure. The base of the building is instead shown on a marble-like surface, consistent with the decorative nature of a gingerbread setup, which does not align with a traditional paved road imagery.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the building have a square base with rounded corners on the upper levels before transitioning into the dome?",
    "explanation": "Image B demonstrates a building with a single level and a dome directly transitioning from the rectangular base without intermediate levels or rounded corners. This reflects the characteristic style of a simplistic gingerbread house without architectural complexity.",
    "answer": "No"
