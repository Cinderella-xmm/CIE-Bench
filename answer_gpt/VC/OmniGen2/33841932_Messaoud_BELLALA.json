      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the curved, tapering silhouette of the central golden skyscraper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookmarks feature illustrations of skyscrapers within small frames. The central skyscraper in Image A is notable for its curved and tapering silhouette, particularly at the top. In the bookmarks of Image B, the skyscrapers have a simple, straight appearance without the same distinctive curvature or tapering. This means that the bookmarks do not retain the curved, tapering silhouette of the central golden skyscraper from Image A.",

      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the sharp, asymmetrical top of the leftmost skyscraper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's bookmarks depict stylized skyscrapers. The leftmost skyscraper in Image A has a sharp, asymmetrical top, which is a distinctive feature. In the stylized illustrations of Image B, the buildings do not reflect this distinct asymmetrical top; instead, they have more simplified and uniform tops. Thus, the bookmark does not retain the sharp, asymmetrical top of the leftmost skyscraper from Image A.",

      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the stepped, rectangular form of the building next to the central tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the building next to the central tower displays a stepped, rectangular form. Image B's bookmarks use simplified geometric shapes to represent buildings, which lack the intricacy of a stepped design. None of the skyscraper illustrations in Image B replicates the stepped, rectangular form seen next to the central skyscraper in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the vertical light strip pattern on the right-side skyscraper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The right-side skyscraper in Image A is characterized by a vertical light strip pattern. In Image B, the bookmarks show skyscrapers with basic lines and shapes, but do not exhibit the same vertical light strip pattern, likely due to the simplified artistic style. Therefore, the bookmark does not retain the vertical light strip pattern of the skyscraper from Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the bookmark preserve the height-to-width ratio and tapering proportion of the central skyscraper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central skyscraper in Image A has a distinctive height-to-width ratio and a tapering design. In Image B, the bookmark illustrations of skyscrapers are more compact and uniform in style, which does not accurately preserve the specific height-to-width ratio or tapering proportion of the central skyscraper from Image A. Therefore, the bookmark does not preserve these aspects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the wider base of the central skyscraper compared to its upper section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central skyscraper in Image A has a base that appears wider compared to its upper section, giving it a tapered appearance. In Image B, the bookmark representations use simplistic forms that do not distinguish a wider base in relation to the upper sections of the skyscrapers depicted. Hence, the bookmark does not retain the characteristic wider base of the central skyscraper.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image A, a red buoy is visible on the water in the foreground. In Image B, which consists of bookmarks with illustrations of cityscapes, none of the images depict a water scene with a buoy, as they focus solely on the buildings themselves. Thus, the red buoy is not present in the edited image.",
