      "question": "Is there a single dark brown seed visible in the center of the apple's cross-section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apple is shown with a clear cross-section revealing the inside. The visible area at the center of the apple cross-section shows a dark brown seed. This can be determined from the curved lines and the shape typical of apple seeds, which are usually dark brown and located in the central core of the apple.",

      "question": "Does the appleâ€™s flesh show a dry, fibrous texture with visible vein-like patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apple's flesh is depicted with a dry and withered appearance, displaying vein-like patterns across its surface. This look is typical of an apple that has dehydrated over time, where the internal structure becomes fibrous and less smooth.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible stem protruding from the top of the apple. The stem is colored dark brown, which is a common characteristic of apple stems. This suggests the natural appearance and position of an apple stem.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the apple cut vertically, revealing an interior view of its cross-section. The symmetry is evident as both halves of the apple mirror each other along the vertical axis, demonstrating a typical vertical apple slice.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The setting in Image B depicts the apple placed on a uniformly colored surface. This surface appears light gray and matte, with no reflective or glossy characteristics observable, indicating that it is indeed flat and light gray.",
