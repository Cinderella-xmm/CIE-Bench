      "question": "Is the red lantern room with glass panes and domed roof present at the top of the lighthouse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the lighthouse has a distinctly red lantern room at the top, featuring glass panes and a domed roof. This matches the typical description of a lantern room in a lighthouse, providing visibility for the light source. The red color and structural features suggest it's a common design element for lighthouse tops.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the lighthouse have a cylindrical tower with a tapering shape and weathered stone surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the lighthouse is depicted with a cylindrical shape that tapers slightly towards the top, consistent with many lighthouse designs to allow for better structural integrity against winds. However, the surface appears smooth rather than weathered, suggesting a newer or well-maintained structure.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a metal railing encircling the lantern room near the top of the lighthouse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a metal railing surrounding the lantern room near the top, which is a typical feature for safety and maintenance purposes, allowing personnel access around the lantern room.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the lighthouse have a rectangular stone base with arched windows and a central wooden door?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighthouse in image B is set on a rectangular base with visible arched windows. However, the door appears to be stone rather than wood, indicating a structural design that uses stone materials, common for durability against harsh weather conditions. Thus, the description only partially matches.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighthouse standing on rocky terrain within the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the lighthouse situated on rocky terrain inside a globe, making it appear as if it's rooted in a small island or rock surface, consistent with its typical placement to minimize erosion and provide stability.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there waves depicted around the base of the lighthouse, indicating its seaside location?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The presence of waves in image B surrounding the lighthouse base suggests that it is indeed located near the sea. The waves indicate a coastal environment, which is typical for lighthouses to warn ships of nearby land.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the windows on the tower arranged vertically with one small window above another, and an arched window on the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing image B, the windows appear to be arranged vertically down the tower. However, finer details about the window arrangements and types aren't as clear; from the visible perspective, it is challenging to distinguish these specific arrangements exactly as described. Thus, a confident affirmation of small windows and their arrangement cannot be made.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is there a wooden door centered on the front face of the lighthouse base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the door visible at the front of the lighthouse appears prominently centered, fitting the typical architectural design focusing on accessibility. However, the material appears to be stone rather than wood when focusing on the edited version, indicating different material usage.",
