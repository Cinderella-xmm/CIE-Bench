      "question": "Does the giraffe retain its distinctive brown patches outlined in cream?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffe is depicted as a toy figurine within a display case. Despite being stylized in a LEGO mini-figure form, this figurine maintains the characteristic visual pattern of a giraffe, which includes brown patches outlined by a lighter cream color. This design choice aligns with a common representation of giraffes and uses simplified yet recognizable patterns to ensure the mini-figure resembles a real giraffe.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the person depicted with extended hands toward the giraffe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a LEGO-style figure of a person inside a display case with one hand extended towards the giraffe figurine. This detail mirrors the pose seen in real-life depictions of interactions with animals where hands are often outreached for feeding or touching.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the person and giraffe positioned close together, maintaining their original relative distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO figurines of a person and a giraffe are placed in close proximity within a container. This configuration within the limited space of the display case results in close interaction, a decision that mirrors their spatial relationship in a more realistic setting depicted in Image A, where the human and giraffe are standing near one another.",

      "question": "Does the giraffe retain its long neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Even in the stylized LEGO mini-figure format of Image B, the giraffe retains the elongated neck, which is a defining feature of a giraffe's anatomy and necessary for representing the animal accurately, even in a toy version.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO figure representing a person in Image B is wearing blue-colored attire, which visually resembles the light blue uniform seen in Image A. The use of color in the LEGO figure helps convey the same uniform without mimicking intricate details.",
