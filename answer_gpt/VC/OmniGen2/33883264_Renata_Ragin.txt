    "Question": "Q1: Are the pointed Gothic arches clearly visible within the stone towers of the bridge?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bridge structure appears different due to the massive statue-like figure that has replaced the stone towers. The typical Gothic arches are not visible as this figure occupies the space, obscuring the original bridge architecture. This indicates any distinct Gothic features are not present in the edited image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the American flag still present on top of the left tower of the bridge?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a large statue occupies the position where the bridge towers and the associated American flag would have been. This change results in the absence of any such flag being visible; hence, the American flag is not present in the edited structure.",
    "answer": "No"
