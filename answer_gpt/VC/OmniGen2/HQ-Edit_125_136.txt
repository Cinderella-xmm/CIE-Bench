    "Question": "Q1: Is the American flag patch present on the right shoulder of the astronaut?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, I observe an illustration of an astronaut, which coincides with the theme presented in the infographic. The infographic does show an astronaut design, and based on typical astronaut suit designs, the American flag patch is commonly found on the shoulder. However, since the image focuses on an infographic layout with text and design elements, there's no detailed depiction of a spacesuit like in Image A. Additionally, shoulders of any astronaut are not explicitly shown in Image B. Therefore, the question's relevance may be misplaced as it relates to Image A.",
