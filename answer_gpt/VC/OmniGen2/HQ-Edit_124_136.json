    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the figure seated in a cross-legged position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is seated on a rectangular platform rather than the ground. The legs are visibly positioned straight down rather than crossed, indicating the figure is seated normally. Cross-legged would involve visibly bent and overlapping legs, which is not present here.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the right hand positioned above the strings in a plucking gesture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's right hand is holding the neck of the instrument, not positioned above the strings in a plucking motion. A plucking gesture would involve the right hand hovering over the strings with fingers spread, ready to pluck them.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the left hand positioned on the neck of the instrument with fingers pressing the strings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left hand is visibly positioned on the body of the instrument, suggesting a plucking gesture rather than holding the strings on the neck where individual fingers press the strings. Pressing strings typically involves a precise finger placement on the neck.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the figure facing forward with the head slightly tilted upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the blurred face, the general posture of the head seems to be a straightforward position with no visible upward tilt. An upward tilt would involve the face angled upwards from a horizontal line.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the figure have a long, flowing white beard and mustache?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is depicted with a long, flowing white beard and mustache. This is visible beneath the blurred area where the beard stretches downwards. The flowing characteristic is indicated by the length and spread of the beard across the chest.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the figure wearing a brown, textured turban?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is wearing a brown garment on the head, but it is more of a hood than a turban. A turban generally wraps around the head multiple times with visible texture; however, the garment in Image B appears singular and smooth.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a visible soundboard area on the instrument?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the musical instrument features a distinct soundboard area, characterized by its circular design with decorative patterns located centrally on the body of the instrument, this is typical for lutes where sound resonates from.",
