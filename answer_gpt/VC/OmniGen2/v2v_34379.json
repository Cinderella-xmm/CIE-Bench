      "question": "Are the broccoli florets in both dishes still composed of distinct tree-like branching structures with dark green crowns and lighter green stems?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dish on the left contains broccoli florets, which visually retain their typical tree-like form with dark green crowns and lighter green stems. This observation aligns with common knowledge of how broccoli commonly appears in its raw form. The right dish contains a liquid, thus there are no broccoli florets to analyze for this trait.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the cauliflower florets retain their compact, rounded, and textured white clusters regardless of size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left dish contains cauliflower florets that appear as compact, rounded clusters with a textured surface, consistent with their typical appearance. In the right dish, no cauliflower is present, preventing analysis beyond the left dish.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the vegetables in the left dish still bright green (broccoli) and creamy white (cauliflower), without any browning or charring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The left dish in Image B clearly shows broccoli and cauliflower florets that maintain their fresh colors: bright green for the broccoli and creamy white for the cauliflower. There are no signs of browning or charring, which indicates they are raw or uncooked.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the vegetables in the right dish still exhibit golden-brown caramelization and dark charred edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right dish contains a liquid and not vegetables. The description of caramelization and charred edges typically fits roasted veggies, but in this image, there are no vegetables to exhibit these characteristics.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are both dishes identical in shape—rectangular with two handles at the top and bottom—and made of white ceramic material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both dishes in Image B have a rectangular shape with handles visible on the top and bottom, consistent with common dish design. The color of the dishes in the image is white, suggesting they are ceramic, as ceramic dishes often come in white",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a background that appears to be a wooden surface with a light brown hue and discernible wood grain patterns running horizontally, which is consistent with the description.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the dish containing raw vegetables positioned on the left, and the dish containing roasted vegetables on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left dish contains raw vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower, while the right dish contains liquid soup, rather than roasted vegetables. Thus, this doesn't match the description fully as no roasted vegetables are present in the edited image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there visible seasoning specks or browning marks inside the right dish, particularly around the roasted vegetables?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the right dish contains a homogenous liquid, hence no visible seasoning specks or browning marks are present, which would otherwise be expected with roasted vegetables.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Is the lighting evenly distributed from above, resulting in minimal shadows under the dishes and vegetables?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears uniform, casting minimal shadows under the dishes. This suggests even lighting conditions, common in food photography to highlight the colors and details without shadows distracting from the subjects.",
