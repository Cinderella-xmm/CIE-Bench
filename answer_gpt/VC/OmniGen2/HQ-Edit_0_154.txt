    "Question": "Q5: Are all four banknotes (U.S. $20, Qatari Riyal, Indian Rupee 50, U.S. $1) present together in the same visual space?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, abstract iconography for these currencies is present collectively rather than actual banknotes as would be expected in real life visuals. Thus, the real-life versions of these currencies are not together in the same visual space, so No is the answer.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the original dominant colors of the banknotes (green for USD, pink-orange for QAR, yellow-brown for INR) preserved?",
    "explanation": "The edited image employs a representative color palette for currencies like green for USD and blue for QAR, which deviates from the actual colors. Although some attempt is made to distinguish them by color, it's not precise to real-life banknotes, hence the response is No.",
    "answer": "No"
