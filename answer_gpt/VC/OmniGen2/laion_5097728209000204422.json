      "question": "Are the rectangular-framed glasses present on the subject's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible signs of rectangular-framed glasses on the subject's face. The attire and style suggest a historical or artistic representation rather than a contemporary photo where glasses might be worn.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the gray and white beard and mustache present on the subject's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an artistic or historical portrait style, and there is no visible gray and white beard or mustache. Such facial hair would likely be incongruous with the more polished and formal representation.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the graying hair visible on the top and sides of the subject's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair is neatly styled as befitting a historical portrait. There are no signs of graying hair; instead, it appears smooth and uniformly colored, which aligns with the formal and elegant context of the portrait style.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analysis of Image B, there is indeed a ring visible on the subject's left hand. This could indicate a status or symbolism typical of historical or formal portraiture where jewelry is often displayed.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the hands of the subject visible with natural skin tone and proportion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases hands that appear stylized and consistent with its historical or artistic theme. Though they are proportioned to match the attire and setting, the natural skin tone effect might be adjusted to fit the portrait style.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the facial structure, including the nose, jawline, and eye spacing, consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The artistic representation in Image B may have altered proportions typical of a portrait, potentially differing from the realistic anatomical proportions in Image A. Such stylistic choices are made to fit historical or fictional standards of beauty or expression.",
