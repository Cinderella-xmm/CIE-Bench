    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the original woman’s facial features, including the shape of her eyes, nose, mouth, and jawline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the woman's facial features are obscured, which means the specific aspects such as the shape of the eyes, nose, mouth, and jawline cannot be accurately evaluated as retained or altered. This visual cue clearly indicates that these facial details are not preserved.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the original woman’s skin tone preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image has the woman's face blurred, which affects the ability to assess her skin tone directly. However, looking at the visible areas like hands, the skin tone appears consistent with the original image. Since the facial features are not assessable, the skin tone of the visible body parts is the only point of reference.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image preserve the walking posture with the left leg forward and the right arm bent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original image displays a walking posture with the left leg forward and right arm bent. In the edited image, she is standing with no evident walking posture; her left arm is holding a fan instead of showing movement. Therefore, the posture in Image B does not preserve the left-step-forward position seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the hand positions preserved, with the right hand extended forward and the left hand near the hip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the right hand is extended forward and the left hand hangs near her hip or holds a shopping bag. In Image B, her right hand holds a fan raised up rather than extended forward, while the left hand is not visible holding an object near the hip. Thus, her hand positions differ between the images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the woman continue to look directly at the camera with the same gaze direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the woman's gaze direction cannot be determined due to the obscured face. The position does not indicate a direct camera orientation since no eye detail is available to confirm directionality.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the body shape and proportions of the woman preserved, including her slender frame and leg length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images showcase similar body proportions, with the edited image maintaining the slender frame and Observable leg length as seen in the original photo. This consistency points to preserving her body shape and proportions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the original volume and curl pattern of the woman’s hair preserved, even if partially obscured or styled differently?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image presents the same voluminous, curled hair pattern, albeit styled differently to add a hat. The curls and volume match the original portrayal, indicating preservation despite new styling elements like a feathered hat.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
