      "question": "Is the wide, straight avenue leading directly toward the base of the Eiffel Tower preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, we see a perfume bottle featuring the Eiffel Tower motif. There is no depiction of a wide, straight avenue beneath the Eiffel Tower leading directly to its base. This feature is replaced by the design of the perfume bottle, with no visible elements of an avenue. In contrast, Image A shows the original scene with a wide avenue. However, the question is specifically about the presence of such an avenue in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the symmetrical rows of green trees lining both sides of the avenue preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a perfume bottle with the Eiffel Tower image; no trees are visible. In the original Image A, there are symmetrical rows of green trees lining the avenue leading toward the Eiffel Tower. The question pertains to the presence of these trees in Image B, where such detail is absent due to the concept-focused design.",

      "question": "Are the streetlights positioned along the sides of the avenue preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design is focused on the Eiffel Tower within a perfume bottle, lacking any street elements like streetlights. Image A clearly shows streetlights along the avenue. The edited image does not maintain this feature as it does not include street elements in its concept.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B does not portray any street scenes, including asphalt surfaces or reflections. It is dedicated to the artistic representation of the Eiffel Tower in a perfume bottle. Image A shows a wet asphalt surface with reflections, but Image B omits any such street surface details.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on the perfume bottle design with the Eiffel Tower, and there is no sky depicted. Image A features an overcast sky with dark clouds. The edited image does not depict any sky or weather elements due to its focus on the perfume bottle and symbolic representation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a perfume bottle with the Eiffel Tower inside, and at the bottom of the Eiffel Tower's depiction, there is a simplified skyline that includes buildings. However, these buildings are not detailed or identifiable like those in Image A. They serve a decorative purpose in the design rather than a realistic portrayal. Thus, although there is a suggestion of a skyline, it isn't preserved in a detailed or identifiable way.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B features a perfume bottle design concentrating on the Eiffel Tower and does not include any road scenes with vehicles. Image A contains vehicles such as cars and a bus on the road leading up to the Eiffel Tower. Image B omits these elements entirely.",
