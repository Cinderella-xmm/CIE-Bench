      "question": "Is the subject's hair dark brown and wavy in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is represented as a stylized figure, similar to a LEGO model, which simplifies and abstracts physical attributes. The hair appears to be dark brown and is styled in a similarly recognizable wavy pattern. Additionally, the stylization is consistent with depicting realistic features in a simplified manner.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the subject wearing a light blue shirt in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized figure is shown with a shirt that is blue in color. The intensity and shade of blue replicate the 'light blue' color seen in realistic settings, typical of a LEGO or toy representation. Simplified stylized figures often portray basic clothing colors that match real articles of clothing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible chest pocket on the shirt of the stylized figure. This type of figure often abstracts details like pockets to streamline the design. Such simplification is typical in stylized representations, where details unnecessary for basic identification are excluded.",

      "question": "Are the subject's hands positioned on the laptop keyboard in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's hands are placed near what seems to be a laptop keyboard. The block-like nature of the figure closely mimics an interaction with a keyboard, suggesting this as its intended depiction. This pose is typical in figurines demonstrating engagement with a computer.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized figure is positioned straight towards the laptop, not indicating a noticeable turn or facing direction other than directly at the laptop. Figures like this usually have limited rotational articulation, presenting more straightforward poses.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a laptop is indeed present in front of the figure, showing a typical depiction of a seated person working at a desk. The design aligns with common portrayals of working environments in toy or figurine sets.",
