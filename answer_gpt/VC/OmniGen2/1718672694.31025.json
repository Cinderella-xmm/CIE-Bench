      "question": "Is the winding stone path composed of irregular flat stones leading upward toward the central structure present in the same location and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a stone path is visible leading towards the central tree structure. It begins in the foreground and continues towards the tree, showing a winding pattern. The path consists of flat stones, which is similar to what is observed in Image A. Based on visual cues, this path maintains a similar location and orientation in both images.",

      "question": "Are the large, scattered rock formations visible along the grassy slope at the base of the structure preserved in their original positions and sizes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are rocks present within the grassy area around the base of the tree structure. However, these rock formations may not be identical to those in Image A, which are more prominently featured at the base of the castle. Image A shows larger rocks scattered along the slope, while Image B has rocks integrated into the base area but not as prominently or in the same arrangement.",

      "question": "Are the tall, leafy trees forming a natural border on both the left and right edges of the image still present, maintaining their original height, density, and positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges are surrounded by tall, leafy trees, similar to Image A. The density, height, and positioning appear relatively unchanged, maintaining their role as a natural frame for the central subject.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sky above the castle still depicted with soft daylight and scattered white clouds against a pale blue background, preserving the original lighting quality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a different atmosphere with a more vibrant green hue dominating the scene. Although there is light coming from above, it appears greener and more mystical, contrasting with Image A, where the sky is shown with daylight and clouds. The lighting in Image B does not preserve the original’s gentle daylight and clear cloud depiction.",

      "question": "Is the hillside beneath the castle still gently sloped upward from the foreground, covered in green grass and supporting the stone path and rocks in their original configuration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a grassy area leading up to the large tree structure, which is similar to the gentle slope in Image A leading up to the castle. However, the elements on the slope, such as the placement of rocks and the configuration of the hillside, may have differences to accommodate the scene change from a castle to a tree.",
