    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the angular, multi-tiered headdress with symmetrical side flaps present and unchanged in shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the angular, multi-tiered headdress with symmetrical side flaps appears to be maintained in both shape and position. The construction and side flaps exhibit a noticeable symmetry. Based on the visual information, there seems to be no alteration to the headdress's structural components.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the eyes glowing amber in color and positioned symmetrically within the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a blurred portion where the face would be located, making it impossible to distinguish details such as glowing amber eyes or their symmetry. Without clear visual cues, we cannot determine the presence or color of the eyes.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the stepped stone pedestal base present with distinct horizontal layers forming a pyramidal shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pedestal base exhibits distinct horizontal layers and forms a pyramidal shape. The stone structure is visible, supporting the object atop it. The pyramidal formation is clear from the layering visible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the segmented mechanical joints visible along the neck, beneath a translucent casing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image does not provide a clear view or indication of segmented mechanical joints beneath a translucent casing along the neck area. The visible mechanical part in Image B is blurred, which inhibits visual identification of such details.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the head oriented directly forward, facing the viewer without rotation or tilt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Without examining the blurred face, the object atop the pedestal appears to be positioned directly forward towards the viewer, showing no signs of tilt or rotation. The main structure maintains its forward orientation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the face symmetrically structured with aligned nose, lips, and jawline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not provide sufficient visual information to assess facial symmetry or alignment of specific elements such as nose, lips, and jawline, due to the blurred area covering these features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the head positioned directly atop the stepped pedestal, supported by it without floating or being detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head structure is visibly positioned directly atop the stepped pedestal and appears supported by the pedestal without signs of floating or detachment. The base supports it solidly.",
