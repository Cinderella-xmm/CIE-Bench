    "Question": "Q1: Does the transformed sculpture retain a central tall spire flanked by multiple smaller turrets arranged symmetrically?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal sculpture features a central tall spire flanked symmetrically by multiple smaller turrets. This arrangement resembles a common architectural design for castles, emphasizing symmetry and balance. Hence, the transformed sculpture does retain this structural arrangement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there small red flags positioned at the tip of each turret of the crystal sculpture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal sculpture does not have any red flags positioned at the tips of its turrets. The design focuses on clear crystal structures without additional elements like flags.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the shovel located in the foreground, angled toward the base of the castle, and partially submerged in reflective water?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no shovel present in the foreground. The focus is on the crystal sculpture alone, without any additional elements like a shovel or reflective water at its base.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the gemstones (replacing seashells) grouped in a cluster at the foot of the crystal castle, similar to the original shell arrangement?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, gemstones are visible and grouped at the foot of the crystal castle, which mirrors the arrangement of seashells at the base of the sandcastle in Image A. This suggests a similar positioning to maintain the visual balance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the frosted glass slab feature a continuous horizontal wave pattern that mimics the original oceanâ€™s rolling motion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the frosted glass slab does not feature any wave pattern that mimics the ocean's rolling motion. It is presented as a flat and clear surface focusing on the crystal structure on top.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the tallest tower located centrally within the crystal sculpture, rising above all other structures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tallest tower of the crystal sculpture is centrally located and rises above the other turrets, maintaining a hierarchical structure often seen in castle designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the shovel retain a red blade and yellow handle, even if rendered in crystal or another material?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, no shovel is present as part of the crystal sculpture. The components of the sculpture focus solely on the architectural features of the castle without additional elements such as a shovel.",
    "answer": "No"
