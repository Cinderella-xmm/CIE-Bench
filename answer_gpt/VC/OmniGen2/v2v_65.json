      "question": "Is the helmet equipped with two curved horns and a central white feather-like adornment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character inside the snow globe has a simplified and stylized design typical of a chibi or toy figure. The helmet features are minimal and do not include detailed adornments like a central feather. Instead, it's more about capturing the essence in a cute form without such intricate details.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the character hold a round shield with a central boss and rivets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character holds a shield, but it follows a stylized, simplistic design consistent with a toy or figurine. The details are reduced, and there's no evident central boss or rivets visible on the shield. This minimalistic design is common in chibi-style figures where emphasis is less on realism and more on abstraction and cuteness.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a sword sheathed at the character’s back with a visible hilt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figure doesn't show highly detailed features such as a sword with a clearly visible hilt due to its compact and simplified appearance. Such figurines focus more on prominent features, and detailed elements like a sword at the back may be subdued or omitted for simplicity.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the shoulder pauldron feature a swirling Norse-inspired engraved pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the character does not have visible detailed engravings like swirling Norse patterns on the shoulder pauldron. The design is much more simplified, as is common in chibi representations to capture the characteristic features without intricate detailing.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the tunic have fur trim along its edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's outfit has a greatly simplified design typical of a chibi or toy figure, which usually doesn’t depict detailed elements like fur trim. The emphasis here is on essential features without intricate details like all-over fur trims.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the armor exhibit a metallic texture or finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi figure in Image B has a design that does not focus on textural realism such as metallic finishes. The surface appears smooth without the sheen or color variations characteristic of metallic textures, as the chibi style frequently simplifies such details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the horns on the helmet curved outward and upward, positioned symmetrically on either side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's helmet might have stylized elements but doesn't show noticeable outward and upward symmetrical horns. In chibi representations, such elements can be miniaturized or symbolically abstract, often lacking the real-world appearance of horns curving as described.",
