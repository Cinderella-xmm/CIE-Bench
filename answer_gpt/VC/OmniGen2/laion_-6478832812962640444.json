    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the toe box of the boot rounded?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toe box of the boot is visibly defined by a straight-edged, squared shape rather than a rounded contour. This analysis is based on the clear delineation observed at the front part of the boot, which is characteristic of a square-toe style commonly found in cowboy boots.",

      "question": "Does the boot have a V-shaped opening at the top of the shaft?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the top of the boot shaft, a clear V-shaped notch is visible. This type of opening is typical for western-style boots, providing both style and ease for pulling the boot on. The V-shape is prominent and distinct against the otherwise rounded structure of the boot's upper shaft.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible continuous white piping running along the shaft of the boot. The boot shows neatly stitched patterns and seams, but no white piping is evident in its design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits prominent decorative patterns both on the upper shaft and the vamp area of the boot. These patterns are typical ornate stitching and embossing associated with cowboy boots, adding to their aesthetic appeal.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boot in Image B clearly features a distinct block heel, which elevates the rear portion of the boot. This type of heel is a common element in cowboy boot design, providing lift and a stable base.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the surface of the boot exhibit visible texture resembling leather grain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the boot appears smooth and polished without any visible texture resembling a natural leather grain. The boot has a sleek, glossy finish suggesting a different material or heavily treated leather that minimizes grain visibility.",
