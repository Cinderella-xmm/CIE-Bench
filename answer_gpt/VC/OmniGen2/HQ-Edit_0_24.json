    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the woman’s gray hair styled in a neat bun atop her head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no woman present; instead, the image features a floral scene with gardening tools and flowers. The absence of a woman indicates that questions regarding her appearance, including hairstyle, do not apply to Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the woman wear a light blue blouse with long sleeves and a V-shaped neckline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any person, so there is no woman present to wear a blouse or any other garments. Therefore, questions about clothing do not apply to Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the trowel held in the woman’s right hand and partially buried in the soil of the garden bed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B lacks a human figure, there is no one who could be holding a trowel, and thus, this question does not apply to Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a rectangular raised garden bed directly in front of the woman, filled with dark soil and blooming daisies, roses, and zinnias?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a central planting area with soil and some flowers is visible, but there isn’t a human figure to reference for a 'directly in front of the woman' scenario. Without the context of the woman's position, answering is not directly applicable.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is a silver watering can placed on the wooden path to the right of the garden bed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silver watering can is visible but it is placed in the foreground rather than being explicitly on a wooden path. Without a significant human context, reference to a 'right' in relation to a person isn't applicable.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is a blue plastic container with compartments containing small gardening tools located to the left of the garden bed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show a blue plastic container with gardening tools present. The image focuses on flowers and gardening supplies, without such a container.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is a wooden pathway visible beneath the woman’s feet, extending toward the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a person such as the woman, and therefore does not show such a wooden path beneath her feet specifically. Instead, there is a pathway running centrally into the background.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is there a wooden gazebo with a balcony visible on the left side of the image, partially obscured by foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, on the left side, there is a structure resembling a gazebo, but the more prominent elements are the flowers and garden tools decorations. Specific obscurement by foliage is less definable.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Is there a wooden pavilion with a lattice window visible on the right side of the image, behind the flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict any specific wooden pavilion with these characteristics. The floral and garden scene lacks the presence of distinct structures like a pavilion on the right side of the image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q10",
      "question": "Are there distinct clusters of yellow marigolds and pink roses growing in the background behind the woman?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are clusters of flowers including marigolds and roses in the scenery, representing background flora. However, no distinction about their placement 'behind the woman' can be made as there is no woman present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
