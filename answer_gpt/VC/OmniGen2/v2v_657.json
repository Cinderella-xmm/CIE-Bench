      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figure is dressed in a solid black shirt. The straightforward design of such collectible figures often adheres to core elements of the original attire, like color and simplicity. Combining this with the visual similarity to the attire in Image A, the skateboarderâ€™s black shirt color is preserved.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi figure in Image B is shown wearing blue jeans, which mirrors the color and style of the original skateboarder's attire in Image A. Such figures usually replicate significant elements like clothing color, which is evident here with the consistent blue color for the jeans across images.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the skateboard and its position relative to the skateboarder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figure comes with a skateboard placed directly beneath it, similar to Image A where the skateboard is directly in use by the skateboarder. Although the figure is static, its design suggests a standing position on the skateboard rather than an active dynamic pose, indicating a consistent relationship of the skateboard to the figure as seen in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dynamic pose of the skateboarder in Image A, characterized by movement and action, is translated into Image B as a static pose, typical of chibi figures. These figures typically depict a standing position rather than capturing dynamic movement. Hence, the dynamic action of the original pose is not retained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B simplifies textures by adopting a minimalist, cartoonish style typical of chibi figures, which do not aim for intricate details but instead focus on capturing key features and colors. This style omission leads to a loss of detailed textures present in Image A.",
