      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is clearly shown standing on the elephant's back. The visual cues show the horse with its legs firmly placed on the elephant, maintaining balance. The proportions and orientation indicate the horse is correctly positioned as if it is standing on a stable platform, which in this context is the back of the elephant.",

      "question": "Is the elephant shown in a posture that supports the horse on its back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is depicted in a posture that would plausibly support the horse standing on its back. Its back is flat and solid, providing a suitable surface for supporting a weight. This posture aligns with the depiction of both animals and their relative positions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B does not retain a photorealistic appearance. Instead, it has a more stylized, cartoon-like look, with simplified features characteristic of illustrations rather than realistic photography—a result noticeable in the style of the grassy field and sky.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spatial relationship in Image B is indeed preserved, with the horse clearly depicted above and on top of the elephant. The visual composition shows a clear separation of the horse’s legs from the elephant’s back, indicating that it is positioned standing atop the elephant, maintaining the intended hierarchical spatial relationship.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the scene encompassed within an ornate photo frame. The frame is elaborate with distinct carvings typically associated with decorative pictures, indicating the image presentation is contained within this type of frame. This frame adds a stylistic element to the overall image.",
