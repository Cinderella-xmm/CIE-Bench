      "question": "Is the spatial arrangement and relative positions of the machinery consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the machinery has been replaced by candy-themed decor, such as large lollipops and balloons, which do not resemble the industrial machinery found in Image A. The spatial arrangement of these objects is different, given their disparate nature and design in comparison to the original factory setup. The positions and alignment of objects in Image B suggest a creative and chaotic layout typical of whimsical decoration rather than a precise industrial arrangement. However, some features like the machinery that has been transformed into candy still align with the machinery setup in Image A, indicating partial consistency mainly in overall layout but not specific items.",

      "question": "Are the ceiling trusses still providing structural support in the same manner as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features ceiling trusses that appear consistent with those in the original image in terms of structure and design. They still seem functional, providing structural support, as no changes have been made to the ceiling infrastructure indicating alteration. The visual similarity suggests they fulfill the same structural purpose as depicted in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the overall proportions and layout of the room match the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The layout and proportions of the room in Image B appear consistent with Image A, as both showcase a similar expanse with high ceilings and spacious interiors. Although the objects within the room are drastically different, with Image B featuring candy-themed decorations instead of industrial machinery, the underlying architectural layout remains similar, suggesting no alterations in spatial dimensions or room size between the two images.",

      "question": "Is the position and extent of the wall (now transformed into gingerbread) consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall has been visually transformed into gingerbread, yet its position remains consistent with Image A. The brick wall in Image A is a defining element in the room's perimeter, and the transformation in Image B retains this structural aspect, indicating no changes in the wall's location or extent.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the floor (now a river of chocolate) still serve as a base for the machinery in the same way as the original concrete floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floor in Image B, transformed into a chocolate-themed surface, does not serve the same function as the concrete floor in Image A. In Image A, the industrial machinery is supported by the concrete floor, designed to handle heavy equipment efficiently. In Image B, the whimsical design of a chocolate river does not convey the industrial support function typical of a concrete floor, which is integral to a workspace environment.",
