        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cylindrical building with a curved top located near the center-right of the image. This corresponds to the Emaar Tower, which has a distinctive rounded top and cylindrical shape as part of its architectural design often seen in daylight photographs of Dubai's skyline.
