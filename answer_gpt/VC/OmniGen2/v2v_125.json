      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the chibi-style rider is depicted wearing a shirt. The color can be seen as light brown or beige, consistent with the original rider’s shirt color.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "The horse in the edited image is represented in chibi-style artwork, and the color of its coat is visible as brown.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the horse is shown with a bridle depicted in a dark color, consistent with a black bridle.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style rider in the edited image is shown with arms and hands positioned away from the horse's reins, suggesting gestures rather than holding anything. Given the artistic representation and comparison with the original image which depicts the rider holding the reins, it’s clear the chibi rider is not holding the horse's reins.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the background consists primarily of a warm, earthy brown tone that offers a sense of an outdoor environment. While the style is cartoonish, the color palette used reflects typical outdoor earthy tones. Analyzing these color choices in line with common design practices for illustrative contexts supports the presence of an outdoor setting theme.",
