      "question": "Does the lion’s silhouette retain the distinct, wide, rounded mane shape around its head and neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the silhouette of the lion indeed features a mane that appears rounded and wide around its head and neck, which is characteristic of a lion's mane as we generally know it. Although the image is stylized, the shape of the mane matches the typical portrayal of a lion's mane, which flares out around the head and neck in a roundish form. Thus, Image B retains this distinct mane shape.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the lion depicted with its front legs forward and rear legs bent, maintaining a poised, dominant stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette of the lion shows a posture with elevated front legs and bent rear legs, indicating a poised stance. A lion in this posture gives off a dominant and engaging presence, which aligns with our common understanding of a lion in a commanding pose. No comparison with Image A is needed, as Image B visually demonstrates this stance through the alignment of the legs in the silhouette.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the lion’s head turned slightly toward the viewer, rather than fully in profile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lion’s silhouette is facing sideways, fully in profile, without any indication of the head turning slightly toward the viewer. The silhouette focuses on the profile view instead of any frontal or angled head direction towards the viewer, reinforcing the idea of a complete side silhouette. Comparing with Image A, where the lion’s head is slightly turned, Image B does not share this characteristic, as the silhouette does not convey any forward-facing elements.",

      "question": "Is there grass present in the foreground beneath the lion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly showcases grass in the foreground beneath the lion’s silhouette. The grass is depicted beneath and around the silhouette, emphasizing a natural environment fitting for a lion. This aligns with common representations in silhouettes where a ground plane includes realistic elements like grass. A comparison confirms that Image A also has grass, maintaining consistency in environmental portrayal.",

      "question": "Are acacia trees visible in the background, either as natural forms or stylized silhouettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features acacia trees in the background, presented as stylized silhouettes. The acacia trees are distinguishable by their characteristic flat top shape, fitting within a typical savannah background. This choice of background enhances the thematic representation of the lion as 'King of the Wild.' Comparing with Image A, acacia trees are naturally portrayed, maintaining consistency in both images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the lion positioned in the foreground, centered and large in scale relative to the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lion’s silhouette is indeed positioned in the foreground, appearing large and centered relative to the background elements like trees and grass. The dominant placement of the lion emphasizes its significance and reinforces the title 'King of the Wild.' A comparison shows that Image A also follows a similar composition where the lion is large and central, confirming consistency in placement between the images.",
