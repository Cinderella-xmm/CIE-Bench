        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the butterfly prominently features wings with a striking electric blue color. This characteristic is essential to the butterfly's visual appeal, and the edit preserves this. Therefore, the butterfly indeed retains its original iridescent blue color.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's wings show pronounced black edges along their outer margins. This feature is crucial for defining the wing structure and providing contrast with the blue. Thus, the wings in the edited image maintain these black edges.",
