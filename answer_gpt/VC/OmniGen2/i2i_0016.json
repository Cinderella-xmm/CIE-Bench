      "question": "Do both players retain identifiable clothing (white shirts and shorts, white tank top with black bottoms) and hairstyles in the chibi version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, even though the characters are presented in a cartoon chibi style, certain aspects of their clothing are retained. The male character wears a white shirt and shorts, while the female character is depicted in a white top with a black bottom. This matches the clothing style seen in traditional tennis outfits. Their hairstyles roughly correspond to their original versions, with the male character having dark hair and the female character having a ponytail. Despite the stylization, the essence of the clothing and hairstyles from the original image is maintained.",

      "question": "Are both players still holding tennis rackets in the chibi rendition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both chibi characters are holding tennis rackets. The male character has his racket positioned to the side, and although the female character's racket is not explicitly visible in the usual manner due to the chibi art style, there is an implication of her holding it. This mirrors the action seen in Image A where the players are holding rackets, fulfilling the typical imagery associated with tennis players.",

      "question": "Is the handshake pose still maintained between the two chibi players over the net?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi rendition in Image B displays the two characters engaging in a handshake, which is a direct continuation of the handshake depicted in Image A. Despite the stylized form, the gesture is clearly illustrated and is central to the interaction, maintaining the sportsmanship usually associated with tennis matches.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are tennis balls and the net still present in the foreground and middle ground respectively?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the net is present as part of the sticker-like background, reflecting the net seen in Image A. However, tennis balls, which were initially visible in Image A, particularly near the net or court, aren't depicted. Visual priority is given to the characters in this chibi version, focusing on their interaction rather than additional objects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the background still depict an outdoor tennis court or at least retain visual hints of it (e.g., court lines, fencing)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B converts the background into a simple, stylized graphic, lacking the detailed elements such as court lines or fencing commonly seen in tennis courts, which are present in Image A. The chibi style chooses to focus on the interaction between characters rather than sporting context details. Consequently, any hints of an outdoor tennis court setting, like detailed court lines or fencing, are not visually represented in this chibi version.",
