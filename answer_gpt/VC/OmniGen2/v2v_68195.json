      "question": "Are the gingham accents on the cuffs and back bow still present and crisp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gingham pattern can be observed on both the sleeves' cuffs and the bow at the back of the neck. The pattern appears neat and distinct, with clear boundaries between the red and white squares. The visual cue of this plaid design suggests it is crisp as it clearly stands out against the red fabric of the dress.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dress retain its original structure with long sleeves, a gathered waistline, and a flared skirt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress features three key structural components: long sleeves extend from the shoulders, a waistline that appears gathered, and a skirt that flares out from the waist to the hem. This suggests retention of the original design elements.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the \"Nebraska Huskers\" text area still located in the same position on the dress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the text \"Nebraska Huskers\" positioned prominently at the upper chest area of the dress, consistent with typical placement for logos or prominent text on such garments. This indicates that the text area has not been relocated.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the dress predominantly red, even if the shade has been deepened?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The main color of the dress in Image B is red, covering most of the dress's fabric, including the sleeves, bodice, and skirt. Although the background is now yellow, and the shade might be different from Image A, the predominant color of the dress remains red.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the dress still have a gathered waistline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a distinct gathered section where the bodice meets the skirt. This gathering suggests that the waistline is designed to create a visual separation between the upper and lower parts of the dress, typical for retaining a gathered waistline aesthetically.",
