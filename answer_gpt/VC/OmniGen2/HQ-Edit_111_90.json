      "question": "Is the necklace made of metal with a darkened, oxidized silver finish, showing visible contrast in the engraved details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include a direct presentation of a necklace. Instead, it contains a chandelier with similar elaborate metalwork and decorative details as a part of a display inside a glass enclosure. The metal appears to be silver with engraved details, highlighting the design. However, since there's no direct necklace comparison, it's not possible to confirm the oxidized finish based on the context given here.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snake itself is present with a lime-green color similar to its tail in Image A. The visible scales and curved form remain consistent with the original depiction of the snake tail, suggesting the portrayal retains its initial characteristics.",
