    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there at least eight distinct horizontal levels stacked vertically along the building facade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a large jellyfish-like structure is depicted. This structure does not resemble a traditional building with floors and windows but instead appears as a singular futuristic design element. Using world knowledge, a building would typically feature multiple distinct horizontal levels or floors to accommodate separate areas, but this image doesn't follow a conventional architectural pattern. Therefore, based on the image provided, we do not observe distinct horizontal levels as one would in a traditional multi-level building.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a transparent railing structure visible on each balcony, positioned directly outside the windows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a fantastical, large jellyfish-like structure without any balconies or windows that one typically finds in a building. The structure lacks elements such as balconies or transparent railing structures commonly seen outside windows. The translucent and intricate design of a jellyfish does not support the concept of architectural elements like balconies with railings.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the windows on each floor arranged in a continuous, curved arc along the buildingâ€™s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B do not include traditional architectural elements like windows or floors. The design instead resembles a futuristic jellyfish-like entity with flowing curves, but these are not arranged in floors or contain any architectural windows. Therefore, there are no windows present, nor are they arranged in a continuous, curved arc.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Can furniture items (such as chairs or tables) be seen inside the rooms through the windows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design in Image B lacks any visible windows, and consequently, there are no views into interior spaces where furniture could be discerned. The entire structure appears to be a solid, artistic form without any transparent sections that offer a glimpse of an interior.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the building viewed from a low-angle side perspective, showing its height and curving profile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a futuristic jellyfish-like structure. One could interpret it as being observed from a side angle, evidenced by the curving profile, but it doesn't match the traditional view of a building as it is more of an artistic creation. The perspective does highlight the structure's height and curved design, akin to viewing an architectural marvel from below, but it remains a non-building entity.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does each window have a corresponding balcony immediately outside it, aligned horizontally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B doesn't actually feature windows, balconies, or any architectural elements aligned horizontally, as it depicts a fantastical and non-functional structure. Unlike typical buildings with defined spaces like windows and corresponding balconies, this design is an imaginative and singular structure without these features.",
