      "question": "Does the Funko Pop-style figure wear the same uniform and helmet as the original player?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Funko Pop-style figure in the edited image is wearing a baseball uniform and a helmet with blue shades similar to the player's outfit in the original image. The player in the original image, however, wears a gray uniform with a navy-colored helmet, while the figure has a different color scheme with navy on both the jersey and helmet. Therefore, the figure does not wear the exact same uniform and helmet as the player in the original image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the Funko Pop-style figure is clearly holding a baseball bat. This is concluded based on its presence in the packaging box alongside the figure, which is grasped by the figure's hand and is a characteristic aspect of baseball figures.",

      "question": "Does the Funko Pop-style figure maintain a similar posture to the original player while holding the bat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Funko Pop-style figure holds a bat and has a stance indicative of a batting position; however, the style of Funko Pop figures often leads to simplification and exaggeration features. The original player has a ready-to-bat posture with a specific angle and height of the bat, which is different from the more upright and simplified pose of the figure. Therefore, the posture is not similar.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there is a depiction of a baseball very close to the Funko Pop-style figure. This is evident as it's placed prominently with respect to the figure within the packaging, serving to enhance the baseball theme.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
