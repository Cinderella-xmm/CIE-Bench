      "question": "Are the intricate floral and vine motifs present in their original pattern and spatial arrangement across the body and lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot features elaborate designs including floral and vine motifs, which are detailed with a golden color. The patterns appear to cover the entire body and lid, similar to Image A. Therefore, when analyzing the intricate floral and vine motifs' presence and arrangement, they seem to coincide closely with the original pattern and placement found in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the central chamber rendered in a rich camel red hue matching the original teapot’s body color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a rich red hue with some yellow-orange gradient in the central chamber, which contributes to a vibrant, luxurious appearance. Image A also shows a rich red color throughout the teapot. However, Image B introduces some slight variations with the gradient that are not present in Image A, suggesting a minor, yet noticeable difference.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot's handle is clearly defined, with a smooth, polished appearance and follows a similar ornate style to the other details. Its shape and position seem consistent with the handle in Image A, indicating the preservation of its contour.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals a rather simple, round base with small decorative elements in gold. In contrast, Image A has a more elaborate structure, both in terms of color and ornamentation with silver bands. Thus, the base structure and band detailing differ between the two images.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
