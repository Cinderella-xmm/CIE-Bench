      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the image retain the stark black-and-white contrast characteristic of the zebra's stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes are clearly defined with sharp black and white coloring, which creates a high contrast typical of zebra patterning. This visual cue is consistent with the characteristic appearance of zebra stripes, which are naturally high in contrast.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the zebra's mane still upright and striped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's mane is visible and appears upright, with stripes that match the rest of the body. This characteristic is typical of zebras, where their mane stands up and has alternating black and white stripes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the zebra's ears still pointed and visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ears in Image B are pointed and visible, which aligns with the typical anatomical features of zebras. Their ears are usually upright and pointed to help in detecting sounds around them, which is evident in the edited image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the zebra depicted in a grazing posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is bent forward with its head lowered towards the ground, which indicates a grazing posture. This typical stance is common when zebras are feeding on grass or vegetation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background still primarily composed of green grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B does not show green grass; instead it appears as a pattern of black and white stripes, likely to complement the zebra's stripe pattern. This differs from a natural grassy habitat and emphasizes an imaginative design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
