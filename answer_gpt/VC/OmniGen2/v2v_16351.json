      "question": "Are the individuals' facial features, hairstyles, and body types retained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the individuals' features such as detailed facial features, individual hairstyles, and distinct body types are not present as they are replaced with a more simplified and uniform representation. The person in the suit is more mannequin-like rather than showing genuine human characteristics. This transformation leads to differences in the anthropomorphic appearance and suggests that the individuality seen in Image A is not retained.",

      "question": "Is the man in the suit still gesturing with his hands in the same manner as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man in the suit is depicted with a hand gesture, specifically a thumbs-up. Comparing this to Image A, where the man is gesturing with both hands open as if he is presenting or pointing at the jersey, it's evident that the hand posture and the overall gesturing style have changed in the edited image.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the relative positions of the characters (e.g., who is standing next to whom) retained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is only one individual visible, the man in the suit. In contrast, Image A features multiple individuals standing together in a group with particular spatial arrangements. Since Image B doesn't display such group dynamics or relative positions of different characters, the relative positioning is not retained.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the individuals still wearing the same type of clothing (e.g., jerseys, suit) as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the individual visible in Image B is wearing a suit, consistent with what the man in the suit was wearing in Image A. Although other characters are not present in Image B, the similarity in clothing for the man in the suit is maintained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a clear focal point in the new setting that replaces the jersey's position in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a jersey is prominently displayed on a mannequin which replaces the jersey's position in the original Image A. The positioning directs attention to the jersey as the central element in both images, acting as the focal point within the setting. Therefore, the new setting does have a clear focal point similar to the original.",
