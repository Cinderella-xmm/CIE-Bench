      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character's color scheme includes black, white, and very limited use of pink. The visual cues show primarily dark clothing contrasting against a soft backdrop, unlike Image A, which has a clear pink color scheme of the phone. When assessing continuity, the lack of prevalent pink in the outfit of the chibi character indicates a departure from the original phone's color scheme.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible depiction of a camera setup on the chibi character. The accessories associated with technology appear in the form of a headset and devices, but no specific dual-camera feature is integrated into the character's design. This contrasts with the prominent dual-camera feature on the phone in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the chibi character's outfit and accessories reflect the sleek and modern design aesthetic of the original phone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character highlights tech-oriented clothing and accessories, such as sneakers and a jacket, which aligns with a contemporary, tech-driven style. These elements correspond to the sleek and modern aesthetic of the phone seen in Image A, though the emphasis is more on the modern functionality rather than directly mimicking the phone's design.",

      "question": "Does the chibi character have elongated legs as specified, while maintaining a balance with the phone's design elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the chibi character with a typical chibi proportion of a larger head and shorter limbs, which does not include elongated legs. This style is generally disproportionate to the sleek and elongated form factor of the phone in Image A. The focus is on a stylized, cute presentation rather than one paralleling the phone's elongated form.",

      "question": "Is the solid background color chosen to complement the pink color scheme of the original phone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a soft peach or coral tone, which is in a similar color family to the pink of the phone in Image A. This choice of background color can be seen as complementary in a design context, creating a cohesive aesthetic that aligns with the phone's color scheme.",
