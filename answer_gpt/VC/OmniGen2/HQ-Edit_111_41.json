      "question": "Is the chair supported by a five-star base with exactly five legs, each ending in a caster?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chair clearly has a base where five separate arms extend radially from a central column, each arm ending with a caster, which is a common design for office chairs to provide stability and mobility. The five-star base is a standard feature in such chairs to evenly distribute weight and provide good movement.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the headrest cushion is designed as a distinct component from the main backrest. This is visually evident from the different segment above the backrest with a clear separation line between them, suggesting a dedicated headrest.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two armrests visible, one on each side of the chair, extending horizontally. Their positioning is typical for providing support to the user's arms while seated, located at the sides of the seat around the midsection area.",

        "No"
      ],
