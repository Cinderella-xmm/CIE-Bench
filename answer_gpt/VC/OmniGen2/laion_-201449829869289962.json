      "question": "Is the onion-shaped dome on top of the bell tower retained in the same form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bell tower has a conical shape rather than the onion-shaped dome found in traditional architecture, which is present in Image A. By observing Image B and verifying with Image A, it's clear that the dome's shape has been altered. The change is evident due to the difference in silhouette and geometric structure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face on the tower displays Roman numerals and blue hands, correctly positioned on the side of the bell tower. This matches the placement in Image A, where the clock is similarly positioned and styled.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, a black quatrefoil window shape can be noticed prominently on the front of the church. This matches the feature seen in Image A, where a similar window is present, indicating no change in that element.",

      "is_correct": true
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bell tower is depicted as an independent miniature placed under a glass dome, disconnected from the main church but positioned to the left of the central church figure. In Image A, the tower is part of the church's architecture and physically attached.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, behind the glass dome, the terraced vineyard patterns are visible on the hills, much like in Image A. The terraced layers are apparent in both images, suggesting continuation in design and detail.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the conical top of the bell tower in the dome display does not have a cross mounted at its peak, whereas in Image A, the dome does feature a cross at its top. This indicates a change or omission in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the imagery in Image B, which is stylized as a miniature object with possibly different material indications, it maintains the appearance of being constructed with light gray stone blocks. This matches Image A where the tower is traditionally built with such materials.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main roof of the church visible under the glass dome retains a terracotta-like color, similar to the roof seen in Image A. This indicates that the color and style of the roof tiles are consistent between the images.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, multiple small miniature houses with sloped roofs are included in the scene under the glass dome. This is reflective of the multiple small houses seen in the vicinity in Image A, indicating the same stylistic theme is maintained.",
