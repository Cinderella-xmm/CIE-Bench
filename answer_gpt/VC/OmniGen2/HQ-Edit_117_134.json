    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the lid of the piano open and angled upward, revealing the internal structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the piano's lid is indeed open and positioned at an angle, which is typical for grand pianos to allow enhanced sound projection and access to the internal workings. We derive this from the visual cue of the angled lid shape. Common sense understanding of grand pianos confirms this typical feature.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the piano have four legs, each ending in a golden caster, supporting the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the piano has four legs, but they do not end in golden casters; rather, the piano is stylized without casters. The legs in Image A end in noticeable golden casters, which are absent in Image B. The comparison underscores the unique design approach in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there exactly three pedals positioned in a row beneath the keyboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows three pedals situated in a row underneath the keyboard, similar to a typical grand piano setup. This arrangement is standard and expected for such an instrument, which aligns with common knowledge of piano construction.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the keys arranged in the standard piano pattern of alternating white and black keys across the full length of the keyboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the piano keys are represented in a simplified form without the distinct alternating black and white pattern visible across the full keyboard. Instead, the keys are visually stylized without full detailing found typically in conventional pianists like Image A. This indicates that the editing omitted the standard pattern.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a music stand attached to the top front edge of the piano body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a music stand on the body of the piano. This differs from Image A, where music stands are often attached for holding sheet music. Thus, the piano design in Image B excluded this element, indicating a simpler, stylistic version.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the lid connected to the piano body via a visible hinge mechanism near the rear edge of the keyboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any visible hinge mechanism connecting the lid to the piano body, as would be expected in a real grand piano setup for lid articulation. The comparison with Image A—which depicts such hinges—implies that detailed elements were omitted in the stylized representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the piano maintain the same elongated, curved-body silhouette and proportional dimensions as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B presents a piano with an elongated and curved silhouette, it is proportionally different from the elegant and detailed design in Image A. Image B displays a simplified and stylized version aimed at a creative interpretation, rather than replicating the intricate details and proportions seen in Image A.",
