      "question": "Is the cat depicted in a curled-up position with one paw visibly stretched out?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is depicted in a curled-up position, but both paws appear to be tucked in rather than stretched out. The image is a cartoon sticker representation rather than a real photo, focusing on a simplified, playful depiction of a cat's typical resting pose.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the cat shown lying on a curved surface representing the car's hood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is part of a sticker illustration with no indication of a surface like a car hood. Instead, the cat is depicted in isolation with no interaction with any specific surface or background context, as is typical in sticker designs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there reflection lines present on the curved surface under the cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no reflection lines or indications of a surface under the cat, as it is a simplistic sticker illustration focused solely on the depiction of the cat itself. Reflection lines typically suggest a glossy or reflective background, which is absent here.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the entire sticker image surrounded by a thick white outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire sticker image is surrounded by a thick white outline, which is common in many sticker designs to define the boundary of the sticker and enhance its visual appeal against varied backgrounds.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the sticker have a transparent background behind the outlined image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a sticker with a design element comprising a defined outline surrounding the main illustration. Typically, stickers are designed this way to create the impression of a clear or transparent background outside the outline when applied to a surface. The background within the white outline is clear or unified with the surrounding environment when the picture is isolated.",
