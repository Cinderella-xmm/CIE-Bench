      "question": "Does the subject maintain the iconic pose and subtle smile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is depicted in a cartoonish style with a similar arm position as found in the classic Mona Lisa painting. However, the smile is indiscernible due to the blurring of the face. Based on visual cues combined with world knowledge of the Mona Lisa pose, it can be inferred the iconic relaxed pose is maintained but the smile cannot be confirmed due to obscuring.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is seen holding a mug with both hands, consistent with the manner depicted in Image A. The pose has been retained in the edited image, maintaining this aspect of the composition.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are pancakes visible on a plate in front of the subject, and they are topped with berries. This reflects the same detail as found in Image A where pancakes with berry toppings are also present.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a loaf of bread is not visible on the table, unlike in Image A where there is a distinct loaf of bread next to the pancakes. The edited image shows extra plates of pancakes, instead.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table features a vase with an arrangement of roses, rather than a single daisy as seen in Image A. The presence of different flowers indicates the absence of the daisy in the edited image.",
