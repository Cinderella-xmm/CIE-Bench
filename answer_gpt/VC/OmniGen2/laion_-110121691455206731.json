      "question": "Is the text \"MICHAEL KORS\" present in uppercase letters below the 12 o'clock position on the dial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text below the 12 o'clock position reads 'MICHIKORS' instead of 'MICHAEL KORS.' This playful misspelling fits within the humorous nature of the comic strip style seen in the image.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there three subdials located at the 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions, with the 3 o'clock subdial marked 24-hour scale, the 6 o'clock subdial marked seconds, and the 9 o'clock subdial marked minutes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subdials in Image B feature playful designs with faces instead of traditional watch dials, and do not have markings indicating specific time measurements like hours, seconds, or minutes.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a rectangular date window at the 4 o'clock position showing the number \"18\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rectangular date window is present but the number displayed appears to be a playful face rather than the number '18,' reflecting the comic style of the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The watch in Image B has a black leather strap with visible stitching, but the focus of the image is more on the playful elements in the dial, which confirm the strap's resemblance to the original texture.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a silver color tone for the watch case and dial, but the stylized graphic doesnâ€™t clearly show a brushed texture typical in a real watch dial; however, it replicates the metallic quality from Image A in its comic representation.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the minute track is not visible nor does it have markings from 5 to 60. Instead, it showcases humorous elements in the dial distracting from realistic features.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not correctly display traditional Arabic numerals at these positions on the dial. The only visible number is a stylized '2' in a different font at the 12 o'clock position.",

      "is_correct": false
    },

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two pushers and a crown on the right side of the watch case, matching typical watch designs, despite the humorous stylization throughout other aspects of the image.",
