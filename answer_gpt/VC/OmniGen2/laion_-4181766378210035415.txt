    "Question": "Q1: Is the light blue botanical pattern (leaf and vine motifs) present on the bedding in the LEGO version?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bedding has been replaced by a LEGO-like structure with distinct blue blocks and does not feature any patterns or motifs. In contrast, Image A shows a duvet with a light blue botanical pattern. This indicates that the LEGO version does not include the light blue botanical pattern.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the bedding and bed frame rendered in white with light blue accents in the LEGO version?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a bed frame and bedding that are primarily white, but the bedding itself features bold blue LEGO-style bricks rather than light blue accents. This differs from Image A where the accents come from the light blue pattern, not solid blocks. Therefore, the bedding in Image B cannot be described as having light blue accents.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there exactly two pillows stacked vertically on the left side of the bed?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are three pillows stacked vertically on the left side of the bed. This is verified by counting the visible pillows. In comparison, Image A also shows the same number of pillows. Thus, the claim of exactly two pillows is incorrect for Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the blanket folded and positioned on the right half of the bed?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the blanket, represented by blue LEGO bricks, is indeed positioned on the right half of the bed. This setup can be confirmed by the distinct layout where the bricks are only present on the right side. In Image A, the duvet is similarly placed on the right half but features a different pattern.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the background a uniform neutral gray with no additional textures or elements?",
    "explanation": "Image B has a background that is a uniform neutral gray. There are no additional textures or elements visible in the background, which provides a clean and uninterrupted backdrop for the bed setup. This is consistent with the background in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the dark brown rectangular object visible in the upper right corner of the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dark brown rectangular object is absent from the upper right corner. In contrast, Image A does feature such an object. This demonstrates that the edited image does not include the dark brown rectangular object, making the response 'No' correct.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the bed positioned horizontally and centered within the frame?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bed appears to be positioned horizontally along the lower-center of the frame, similar to Image A. The visualization of the bed and its alignment within the center of the frame is evident in both images.",
    "answer": "Yes"
