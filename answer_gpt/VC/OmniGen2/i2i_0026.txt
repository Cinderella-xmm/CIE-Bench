    "Question": "Q2: Does each frame show the player dynamically engaged with the tennis racket and ball, mimicking a natural hitting motion?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the player is depicted as actively reaching for the ball with a racket, suggesting dynamic engagement and a natural hitting motion. Image B doesn't have multiple frames, but maintaining the same scenario across multiple identical-like frames logically supports this consistency.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the racket and ball consistently positioned to indicate a realistic hitting action in every frame?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ball is positioned just before making contact with the racket, which suggests a realistic hitting action. The lack of multiple frames in Image B leaves no reason for variation, supporting consistent positioning.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the player retain his short dark hair in all frames of the sequence?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the player with short dark hair, and without direct physical changes visible within the singular frame provided, the hair style and color would typically remain unchanged across identical-like frames.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the yellow tennis ball appear consistently across all frames, maintaining its bright color and position relevance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis ball is clearly bright yellow and is positioned near the racket, indicating relevance to a hitting action. Given no frame variation in Image B, the bright color and relevant position logically persists.",
    "answer": "Yes"
