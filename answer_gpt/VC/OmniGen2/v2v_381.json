      "question": "Do the nesting dolls maintain a triangular shape inspired by the pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are characterized by their traditional rounded and elongated body shape, typical of Russian Matryoshka dolls, which are cylindrical with a curved top. The original pyramid in Image A has a clear triangular and angular shape, with a base that tapers to a point. There is no visual indication that the nesting dolls have adapted to this triangular form; instead, they maintain their rounded and smooth contour. My analysis is based on the common understanding that nesting dolls are famously rounded, which is reinforced visually by the smooth and curved silhouettes in Image B.",

      "question": "Do the nesting dolls retain the stone texture seen in the original pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features nesting dolls with a smooth, glossy finish, which is typical of painted wood, the usual material for Matryoshka. This texture contrasts significantly with the pyramid's stone surface in Image A, which appears rough and uneven, typical for stone construction. The dolls in Image B clearly exhibit a polished and shiny texture, suggesting they are made from a material such as wood with a paint or varnish coating, rather than stone.",

      "question": "Are the nesting dolls designed with a symmetrical structure similar to the original pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each nesting doll is symmetrically designed, with a central vertical axis of symmetry typical for such figures, meaning one side mirrors the other. This is similar to the original pyramid in Image A, which is geometrically symmetrical along a central vertical axis from its apex to the base. Symmetry in these contexts is about balance and mirroring on either side of this axis, which both objects possess.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are sequentially placed on the table from the largest to the smallest in a line. This descending size order is a common presentation style for nesting dolls, allowing viewers to appreciate the size variation and sequential concept these dolls embody. By observing their alignment and progressively smaller size, it is clear that they are intentionally organised from largest to smallest.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the largest nesting doll and possibly others incorporate a design element resembling the pyramid's central entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls show a decorative pattern comprising bright colors and smooth, curved designs typical for Matryoshka dolls. There are no direct design elements, such as a rectangular or doorway-like feature, that mimic the central entrance visible on the original pyramid in Image A. Instead, the dolls have an artistic design focused on facial features and clothing motifs, lacking any door-like emphasis similar to the pyramid's entrance.",
