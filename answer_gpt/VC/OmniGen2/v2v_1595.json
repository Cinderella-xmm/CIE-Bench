      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the soccer ball retain exactly 12 black pentagonal panels and 20 white hexagonal panels arranged in a spherical configuration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer ball shows a similar design pattern as typical soccer ballsâ€”utilizing black pentagonal and white hexagonal panels. Although the edited image is stylized, the general identification of panels can be inferred through the visible alternating black and white sections. Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce the retention of the arrangement of panels.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the soccer ball depicted as a three-dimensional sphere with curved surfaces and proper perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the soccer ball in a stylized but dimensional appearance, with visible shading and positioning that suggests a 3D spherical shape. The curved surfaces are implied through the geometric contours and common understanding of how spheres are drawn.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the goalpost maintain a rectangular frame with two vertical posts and one horizontal crossbar forming a standard goal shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the goalpost is stylized as a bright rectangular frame. It includes two vertical posts and one horizontal crossbar, the basic elements required for a standard goal shape, albeit presented in animated style.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the net of the goalpost composed of a visible grid pattern of intersecting lines forming square or rectangular cells?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a net with intersecting lines, creating a pattern of cells suggestive of squares or rectangles. The stylized presentation uses bold lines, but the basic grid structure remains visible to the viewer.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the soccer ball positioned in the foreground, in front of the goalpost, with part of the goal visible behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visual analysis of Image B displays the soccer ball placed prominently in the foreground, with the goalpost structure and net visible in the background, maintaining partial visibility of the goal elements behind it.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the seams between the black and white panels of the soccer ball clearly visible and aligned with the edges of the pentagons and hexagons?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The seams between the black and white panels in Image B are illustrated clearly, with outlines that suggest alignment with pentagonal and hexagonal shapes. The stylized nature of the image maintains the traditional panel structure alignment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the soccer ball centered in the foreground and the goalpost positioned directly behind it in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer ball appears centered in the foreground, with the goalpost positioned directly behind it, creating a focal point with both objects aligned in frontal perspective.",
