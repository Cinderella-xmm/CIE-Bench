    "Question": "Q1: Is the woman's facial structure, including her eyes, nose, and mouth, preserved in their original form and positioning?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's face has been blurred, eliminating the details of her facial features such as eyes, nose, and mouth. Typically, facial structure includes identifiable features which are now concealed due to the blur effect. Therefore, it is clear that none of the original features and positioning are preserved.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the dark hair arranged in an updo with a blue ribbon placed on the left side of the head?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the dark hair styled in an updo with ribbons, but the ribbon is placed symmetrically on the crown rather than distinctly to the left. Analyzing Image A, the ribbon appears on the left side; thus, clearly in Image B, the ribbon placement is altered.",
