    "Question": "Q1: Is the NASA logo clearly visible on the left shoulder of the space suit?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the space suit is illustrated without specific logos or emblems depicted, including the NASA logo, which is typically present on real-life space suits as seen in Image A. The design on Image B instead features a stylistic representation without logos for simplification or artistic reasons. Therefore, there is no visible NASA logo on the chibi character's space suit shoulder in the edited image.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the red trim bands visible on the upper arm and lower leg of the space suit?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the chibi space suit with clear red bands depicted on both the arms and legs, which is a typical design element on space suits, providing a visual resemblance to actual designs for stylistic purposes.

    "Question": "Q3: Is the white backpack unit attached to the back of the suit, with coiled white hoses extending down the sides?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi space suit includes a simplified depiction of a backpack unit and has hoses shown connecting the suit, embracing the essentials of a space exploration design. Though stylized, these elements reflect the design cues seen in real-life astronaut equipment as depicted in Image A. The hoses and backpack are part of the Western representation even if cartoonishly interpreted.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the helmet’s visor partially raised, revealing part of the astronaut’s face?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a complete cartoonish rendition of the space helmet with a full visor, characteristic of a classical astronaut design where faces are not represented. Unlike in Image A, where the helmet may allow visibility of the eyes, the cartoon design is meant to portray the closed helmet without facial detail.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the astronaut standing upright with their body oriented to the right side of the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central focus of the illustration is the cartoon astronaut standing upright, but the orientation is towards the viewer rather than the right side of the image. This differs from Image A where the astronaut is actually turned to the right side.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q7: Are the astronaut’s boots and gloves visible and properly attached to the suit?",
    "explanation": "The cartoon representation in Image B visually showcases the astronaut’s boots and gloves as part of the ensemble, integrated into the character’s design reminiscent of real suits in Image A. The stylized, yet complete depiction indicates proper attachment given the character’s presentation norms.",
