      "question": "Is the dancer depicted with her left leg lifted and bent at the knee, while her right foot remains planted on the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is illustrated with her left leg lifted in a bent position at the knee while her right foot stays firmly on the ground. This posture is typically associated with dance movements such as jumping or leaping. The visual cues show the dancer poised with intention and motion, which is typical in dance and is visually coherent for such an expression.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the dancer is situated on the right side and oriented towards the left, indicated by her head and torso positioning alongside the extended arms directing towards that side. This alignment portrays an open and fluid motion typically seen in illustrative art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the skirt of the dancer appear to be flared outward and upward due to motion, suggesting a spinning or leaping movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show the skirt as dramatically flared outward and upward, typically due to dynamic movement such as spinning or leaping. The uplifted vibrant skirt showcases motion through its form and color exerting energy and vibrancy often captured in expressive artistic illustrations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, spatially, the dancer is placed prominently in the foreground, providing depth to the illustration, distinctive from the grouping of animals in the midground and layered trees extending into the background. These layers create a visual hierarchy typical in staged compositions providing dimension and narrative.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visual analysis of Image B suggests illumination from the right side, with shadows cast towards the left side of the frame. The lighting indicates a directional flow across the scene, accentuating the dancer's form and casting shadows accordingly, indicating light sourcing typical in artistic depictions to exude depth.",
