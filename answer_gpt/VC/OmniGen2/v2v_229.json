      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the bed is still the main focal point, depicted centrally and prominently. The visual emphasis is retained as the bed occupies a significant portion of the image, indicating its importance as an object.

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) illustrates a warm glow emanating from the bedside lamp and candle, which is achieved through the use of vibrant yellow and orange colors suggesting warmth. This corresponds to Image A where the lamp and candles emit a similar warm ambiance. Therefore, the warm glow is retained.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bedding is shown with a simplified illustration, but lacks detailed texture depiction. Compared to Image A, where the bedding's softness is indicated by visible textures and materials, Image B does not communicate this aspect effectively.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a single pillow depicted on the bed, while Image A shows multiple pillows arranged across the bed. This indicates a change in the arrangement of pillows from the original to the edited image.",

      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) retains the bedside table's position next to the bed as shown by the table and lamp's arrangement relative to the bed in the image. Comparing this with Image A confirms that the table is in a similar relative position on the side of the bed.",
