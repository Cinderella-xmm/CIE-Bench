      "question": "Is the cheetah face graphic present on the right sleeve of the subject's top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure wears a garment featuring a leopard print pattern, primarily throughout the dress, including the sleeves, without specific graphics such as a cheetah face. This suggests that the visual detail of a cheetah face is not visible. Image A shows a distinct graphic of a cheetah face on the subject's right sleeve, which is absent in Image B.",

      "question": "Are both boxing gloves rendered in gold color with visible yellow laces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boxing gloves on the subject have a shiny gold appearance, resembling metallic boxing gloves, yet the laces appear to blend into the design of the gloves without visible differentiation. In Image A, while the gloves are gold, the yellow laces are clearly visible.",

      "question": "Is the leopard print pattern present on the sleeves and headscarf of the subject?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the subject in a dress entirely covered in a leopard print pattern, including the sleeves. The headdress resembles traditional Egyptian styles and does not feature a leopard print. In Image A, the leopard print is distinct on the sleeves and headscarf. Thus, in Image B, the leopard print pattern is not present on the headscarf.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's headgear is a distinct Egyptian-style headpiece with no significant red, black, or leopard print pattern. In Image A, the subject wears a headscarf with a red and black leopard print pattern, differing from the design seen in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features hieroglyphs and palm imagery carved into the walls in a stylized ancient Egyptian manner. There are no real palm fronds like those visible in Image A, where green palm fronds are prominent in the backdrop.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is framed with a beveled, engraved wall design, not by a simple geometric border pattern typically made of white rectangles. Image A shows a distinct white border of overlapping rectangles framing the image, absent in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a stylized Egyptian figure without any visible cosmetic details such as teal eyeshadow or bright red lipstick due to the absence of facial color details. Image A shows a more modern styling with clear makeup details that are not present in the stylized Image B.",
      "weight": 2,

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject’s pose is with arms prominent before the body, a typical ancient Egyptian profile stance, while wearing gold boxing gloves. Image A displays a modern pose with the left arm visibly raised higher with a gold boxing glove. Image B retains a similar pose with the left arm prominently holding a glove in a forward angled stance.",
