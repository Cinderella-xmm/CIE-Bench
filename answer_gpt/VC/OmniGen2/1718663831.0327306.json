      "question": "Is the dog's fur primarily white with distinct sandy-colored spots on the ears and face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the fur is primarily white, as seen through its clean and light color. The distinct sandy-colored spots can be identified around the edges of the ears based on color variation typical to dogs' fur patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dog have a rounded head with pointed ears and a short muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a rounded body structure typical of small dog breeds, and the ears appear to be pointing upwards. The arrangement gives the appearance of being pointed. Since a short muzzle is common in fluffy breeds, especially smaller ones, it is reasonable to conclude the presence of such structural features.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the dog wearing black rectangular sunglasses with dark lenses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no evidence of sunglasses on the dog. Rectangular sunglasses with black frames would be highly visible, particularly given the contrast they would have against the light fur.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dog's posture in Image B shows it sitting upright, as indicated by the alignment of the body in a position that is forward-facing. The limbs are positioned in a way to suggest this stance, which is typical for dogs sitting obediently.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image in Image B suggests the presence of a compact body, which is typical for smaller dogs, paired with shorter legs visible through the dog's seated posture. A fluffy tail is inferred through the fluffy texture covering the back area, which is common in several breeds.",
