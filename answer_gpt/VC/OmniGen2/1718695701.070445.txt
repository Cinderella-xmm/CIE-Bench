    "Question": "Q1: Is the capybara’s snout shape — including the rounded nose, wide mouth, and visible teeth — preserved in the sculpture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture prominently displays a bronze snout, which appears smooth and stylized, lacking the detailed features of a rounded nose, wide mouth, and visible teeth usually found in a capybara. The stylized design of the sculpture does not exhibit these specific detailed features seen in the original image, where the capybara has a distinct rounded snout, wide mouth, and visible teeth.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the white muzzle area, positioned centrally on the face and extending from the nose to the upper lip, preserved in the sculpture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture does not show any variation in color or texture that would suggest a white muzzle area as seen in the original image. The original image features a white muzzle area centrally located and extending from the nose to the upper lip, but in the sculpture, the facial features are stylized and do not include this coloration detail.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the whiskers present and arranged in the same radial pattern from the snout as in the original image?",
    "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B does feature whiskers emanating from the snout area; however, due to the stylized nature of the sculpture, it's not evident that they follow the original radial arrangement seen in the first image. The original image shows the whiskers as fine lines radially arranged around the snout.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the glasses positioned directly over the eyes, with the frame aligned horizontally across the bridge of the nose?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glasses are positioned on the sculpture with the frame extending over where the eyes would be, similar to the positioning on a face. This aligns with the description of how glasses should be positioned horizontally across the bridge of the nose, consistent with how they are worn in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the sweater and shoulder straps positioned on the shoulders and torso in the same way as in the original image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no evidence of the capybara wearing a sweater or shoulder straps as seen in the original Image A. The sculpture features a smooth, metallic surface without the texture or detail of clothing.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the capybara’s head shape — rounded, broad, and proportionally large relative to the body — preserved in the sculpture?",
    "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B maintains a broad, rounded head shape, characteristic of a capybara, relative to a smaller body which is similar to Image A. This indicates the preservation of general head proportions seen in the original.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the mouth depicted as slightly open, revealing the teeth, in the same manner as the original?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture does not display a mouth that is slightly open or reveal any teeth. This representation differs from the original image where the capybara's mouth is slightly ajar with visible teeth.",
    "answer": "No"
