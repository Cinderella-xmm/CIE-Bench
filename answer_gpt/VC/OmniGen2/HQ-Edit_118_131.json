      "question": "Is the elephantâ€™s head with large, flared ears and visible eye clearly present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant teapot depicts an elephant's head with distinct, large flared ears. The elephant's eye is also clearly visible, reinforcing the theme of an elephant integrated into the teapot design. This depiction uses a common aesthetic approach where the elephant motif is realistically integrated into functional objects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the trunk of the elephant clearly formed into the spout of the teapot, extending upward and backward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the teapot has the trunk of the elephant seamlessly transformed into the spout. The trunk is depicted extending energetically upward and backward, mimicking how teapot spouts function. This design choice marries the characteristic elephant anatomy with teapot usability.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are four distinct legs supporting the body of the elephant-teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, the teapot, shaped like an elephant, visibly showcases four legs that provide stability and support, echoing the stance of a real elephant. These structural elements are visually clear and essential in conveying the realistic representation of an elephant form.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a domed lid with a pointed finial on top of the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B of the teapot reveals a domed lid, capped with a pointed finial, situated on top of the teapot. The design feature aligns with typical teapot design conventions where lids help in heat retention and are often aesthetically enhanced with finials.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are floral patterns, including lotus flowers and vines, visibly engraved on the body of the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot displays intricate patterns, notably with mechanical motifs such as gears, different from floral engravings like lotus flowers and vines. The visual cues suggest a steampunk-inspired design rather than traditional floral motifs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the teapot with a dark, brownish and copper metallic finish, differing significantly from a silver metallic sheen. The color choice reflects a warmer, more dramatic aesthetic compared to a silver reflective surface.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is a matching silver cup and saucer present next to the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no matching silver cup and saucer visible. Instead, a small cup is placed alongside other elements like spoons and tea leaves, highlighting a different setting altogether. This contrasts with the setup in Image A.",
