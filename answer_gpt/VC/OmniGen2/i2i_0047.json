    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the train still primarily painted in blue-purple with a yellow front and red doors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train retains its blue-purple body with a yellow front and red doors, consistent with its appearance in Image A. This observation aligns with the original color scheme visible in both images.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the windows and doors on the train still arranged in their original positions and shapes as seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement and shapes of the windows and doors on the train appear unchanged from Image A, maintaining their original configuration. This suggests the structure of the train's exterior remains consistent between the two images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the train remain connected to the railway tracks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train is altered to appear as if it's floating in a digital or imaginative environment rather than being connected to railway tracks. This contrasts with Image A, where the train is clearly on tracks at a station.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the train wheels still visible and retain their original structure under the carriages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train wheels are faintly visible but the train appears to be elevated or integrated into a different environment, lacking the traditional connection to the tracks as seen in Image A. The focus in Image B is more on the altered setting than the mechanical details.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any infrastructure elements (like bridges or platforms) surrounding the train in the new background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background diverges from a traditional railway station environment to an abstract, vibrant cityscape. There are no visible infrastructure elements like bridges or platforms surrounding the train, which differs from Image A.",
