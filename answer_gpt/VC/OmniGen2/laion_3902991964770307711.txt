    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain exactly three arms—one central and two lateral—arranged symmetrically?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible evidence of multiple arms, as the focus is on a perfume bottle rather than a multi-armed structure. The perfume bottle does not have a central arm or two lateral arms. Therefore, the concept of arms does not apply to this image. Based on the visual cues, it is clear that the arrangement described does not exist in the edited image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the left and right arms symmetrically positioned and shaped relative to the central axis?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object is symmetrical, but it is a perfume bottle, which does not have arms. While the bottle and its label are centered and symmetrical relative to the vertical axis, there are no arms to evaluate. Thus, based on the visuals of Image B, the concept of arms is not applicable, confirming that no arms are symmetrically positioned.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the base circular, flared, and adorned with a beaded or ridged edge?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a perfume bottle with a rectangular base. Although the bottom appears slightly wider due to the transparent glass, it does not resemble a circular or flared base and lacks any beaded or ridged decoration. The base does not fit the described characteristics, relying on visual cues and world knowledge related to bottle design.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the central stem remain a tall, tapering vertical shaft connecting the base to the top arms?",
    "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, features a perfume bottle which has a tall, consistent shape for holding liquid. It does not have a central stem in the sense of a tapering shaft connecting arms, but rather a singular, uniform shape from bottom to top. With no central stem or arms present, it's clear this description does not match the characteristics of Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the arms maintain smooth, curved trajectories from the central stem to the top ends?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle does not feature any kind of arms that would have trajectories. The design is centered around smooth, clean lines typical of bottle design without any extensions, such as arms, emanating from a central stem. Therefore, the description does not fit the bottle design in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
