    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the grid of yellow rounded domes covering the surface of the cake present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake is depicted with a smooth, yellow frosting on top and not with distinct rounded domes. This contrasts with typical dome structures that are clearly separate and rounded. Here, the cake appears as a single, smooth iced layer.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there small red dots on top of each yellow dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a simple cake surface with no evidence of red dots on yellow domes. The yellow icing has no distinguishing red accents that could resemble dots.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cross-section showing a golden sponge base, white cream layer, and deep red jam layer visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake is shown in a solid form without a visible cross-section, so no internal layers like a golden sponge, white cream, or deep red jam can be observed.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are two strawberries with green leaves positioned at the top center of the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cake in Image B is shown with two strawberries on top, positioned toward the center, with noticeable leaves, making them distinct features of the cake.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are chopped nuts visible around the base of the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible chopped nuts surrounding the base of the cake. Its base appears clean without any additional elements like nuts.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the cake maintain a square shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cake depicted in Image B is circular and not square. Circular cakes typically have no straight, angled sides characteristic of a square shape.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the cake placed on a silver-toned plate with an embossed floral pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake is placed directly atop a blue-toned surface, devoid of any silver plate or embossed floral design. Such a surface would be notable and is absent in this depiction.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the deep red jam layer clearly visible between the white cream and golden sponge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not expose the cake's layers, hence the described deep red jam layer between the white and sponge layers isn't visible without a cross-section.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Is the white cream layer visible between the sponge and jam layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual in Image B does not present any cross-section of the cake, making it impossible to discern a specific white cream layer as mentioned.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q10",
      "question": "Is the golden sponge base layer visible in the cross-section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction in Image B of the cake does not include a visible cross-section, hence a golden sponge base layer cannot be identified.",
