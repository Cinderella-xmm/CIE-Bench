      "question": "Is the USB-C port located centrally on the bottom edge of the smartphone, flanked by two sets of three circular speaker holes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smartphone is positioned such that the bottom edge is visible. The USB-C port is centrally placed, and on either side, there are two sets of three small circular holes, which are consistent with speaker holes on a smartphone's bottom edge. This is a common design in modern smartphones.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the smartphone placed diagonally on the wooden surface, with its bottom edge closer to the viewer than the top edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smartphone is on a flat orange surface, not a wooden surface. The orientation shows the smartphone laying flat, parallel to the surface edges, rather than diagonally. The bottom edge is visible, but there's no indication of diagonal placement or a wooden surface.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a wooden surface. Instead, the surface shown is uniformly orange, lacking any grain pattern or fibers that are typically present in wood. The background and surface are smooth and consistent in color.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a solid orange color without any blur effect. The background and the surface are a consistent flat color, indicating the focus is on the mouse and smartphone without a shallow depth of field.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mouse is indeed positioned to the left of the smartphone. However, both objects are on an orange surface, not a wooden one. The setup shows the two items aligned on the same flat surface.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mouse is oriented with its head directly facing the smartphone, which is a typical scenario for capturing an interaction or interest between the mouse and the object. The position of the head and the eyes of the mouse suggests it is turned towards the smartphone.",
