    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the woman’s eyes clearly visible with almond-shaped pupils and defined eyeliner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible face, and consequently, no visible eyes. Without visible eyes, we cannot determine if they are almond-shaped or if eyeliner is present. As there is no evidence to support the description of almond-shaped pupils with defined eyeliner, the answer has to be based on the information available solely in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the earrings consist of long, golden tassels hanging from the earlobes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, mannequins do not display earrings as these are clothing-only models. The absence of figures with ears or earrings means there is no visual information to confirm the presence of long, golden tassel earrings.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a high-standing mandarin collar with blue trim around the neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows several outfits on mannequins. One dress matches the description: it is red with a mandarin collar and blue trim. The other mannequins feature different designs without the described collar style, allowing us to confirm that such a collar exists on one outfit.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there blue frog closures running vertically down the center front of the qipao?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red qipao style dress appears to have motifs and elements reminiscent of frog closures but they are not visibly blue frog closures on the dress. Therefore, this detail does not match with Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the hair styled in an updo with two loose strands falling on either side of the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mannequins do not have modeled hair or hair-styles as they are body mannequins with clothing only. Therefore, there is no hair styled in any form.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the main fabric of the qipao red in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a red dress in the center mannequin, among other color dresses. However, the description rightly fits one mannequin, reaffirming the red fabric of this qipao style dress.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the woman’s right hand positioned near her chest, fingers slightly curled?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features mannequins without hands or human features, focusing solely on the outfits. Thus, there is no woman in the image and no visible hand positions to verify this statement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there embroidered floral patterns visible on the chest and upper sleeves of the qipao?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Several outfits in Image B, including the red dress, display floral patterns prominently. These appear on the chest area and add visual decoration, indicating embroidered-like patterns.",
