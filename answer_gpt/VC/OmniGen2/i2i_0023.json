    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the boy's face retain clear and recognizable features such as eyes, nose, and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boy's face appears as a simple, solid color block without any detailed features like eyes, nose, or mouth. This abstraction is often used in illustrations or cartoon representations, implying a simplified or stylized depiction where facial features are purposefully omitted.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are all four original birds present, with the macaw on the shoulder, the cockatoo on the arm, the canary on the head, and the parakeet near the side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict the birds in the detailed, realistic style seen in Image A. Instead, the birds are represented as simplified cartoon-like elements within the boy's t-shirt design, rather than as distinct figures perched on or around him.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cartoon print on the boy's green T-shirt still visible and intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon print on the boy's green T-shirt is maintained and visible. It features characters resembling birds, a pig character, and other elements in a cartoon style, consistent with the design seen in a pop culture reference like 'Angry Birds'.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the boyâ€™s head visibly larger compared to the shrunken size of the birds in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration simplifies both the boy and the birds into a stylized form where proportions are not necessarily realistic. The changes make the boy's head appear larger relative to the cartoon representations of the birds, which are incorporated into his t-shirt design rather than in an actual size comparison.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image feature a thick white outline around the boy and the birds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the boy and his t-shirt with a distinctive thick white outline separating the primary subjects from the background. This effect is typical of sticker or graphic design and enhances the focus on the central figures.",
