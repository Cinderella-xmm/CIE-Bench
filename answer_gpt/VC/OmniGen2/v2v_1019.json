      "question": "Does the character’s body retain the cylindrical shape and reddish-brown color of the original hot dogs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's body is the hot dog itself, which maintains a cylindrical form that is characteristic of a hot dog. The reddish-brown color of the hot dog is also preserved in the character’s design, indicating that the foundational elements of the hot dog, both in shape and color, are retained in the character's body.",

      "question": "Does the character’s hair incorporate the shredded texture of white, orange, and purple cabbage from the original coleslaw?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hair of the character in Image B displays a texture and color scheme similar to the coleslaw in the original Image A. The hair consists of strands that mimic the shredded appearance of cabbage and includes colors such as white, orange, and purple, reflecting the components of coleslaw.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the decorative border of the plate, featuring teal blue, burnt orange, and dark brown floral and scroll motifs, present in the base design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The decorative border of the plate in Image A has complex floral and scroll patterns in teal blue, burnt orange, and dark brown. In Image B, the plate does not replicate this design; instead, it features a more simplified pattern with a predominantly teal color and small decorative elements, which means the intricate original design is not present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the character positioned on a base that visually derives from the original plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is placed on a circular base, which is likely a stylized version of the plate from Image A. While it does not replicate the exact design, the base's circular shape and the presence of plate-like decorations suggest that it is visually derived from the original plate structure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a single character present, which utilizes one hot dog as part of its design. Unlike Image A, where two individual hot dogs are depicted, Image B does not feature dual bodies or mirrored features that represent two hot dogs.",
