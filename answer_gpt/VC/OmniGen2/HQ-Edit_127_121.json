    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the circular orb-web with clearly defined radial and concentric threads still present and structurally intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no circular orb-web present. Instead, the image features a fantastical depiction of a spider-like creature with large, colorful, butterfly-like wings. This implies that the focus of the image is not on the web structure but on the creature itself. The absence of any web components, based on visual cues and common understanding of what constitutes a spider web, leads to the conclusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the branches positioned in a natural arc around the web, supporting it from multiple directions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks any depiction of branches. The image centers around a stylized spider with colorful wings on a neutral background. Without the presence of any branches or natural arcs supporting a web structure, common sense dictates that the intended focus is on the imaginary creature.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the leaves retain their oval shape, visible venation, and glossy surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any leaves. Instead, it showcases a stylized, imaginative image of a spider-like creature. The absence of natural elements like leaves in this artistic rendition supports the conclusion that the image does not feature any foliage characteristics.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there small, clear water droplets visible on the surfaces of some leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no leaves depicted at all, nor any natural features such as water droplets. The focus is instead on an artistic spider-like creature without any environmental background elements. Given this lack of foliage or liquid depiction, the logical conclusion is that droplets are not present.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background a soft, uniform pale blue-gray sky without additional elements such as clouds or sun?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a luminous, gradient blue background, which serves as a backdrop for the colorful creature. The background is consistent and lacks additional natural elements like clouds or the sun. Based on knowledge about backgrounds in illustrations and the visual cue, the conclusion leans towards a uniform pale color without added elements.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the webâ€™s radial threads visibly connected to the branch ends at multiple points?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no web structure or branches. Instead, it focuses on an artistic creature with butterfly-like wings without any context of a web or connection to natural elements. The absence of visual cues for a network of threads or points of attachment reinforces the conclusion that no such connectivity exists in the image.",
