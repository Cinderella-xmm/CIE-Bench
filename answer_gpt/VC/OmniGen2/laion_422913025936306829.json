      "question": "Is the central figure depicted in a bent-forward pose with one arm raised and the other supporting the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure appears to be positioned in a powerful, upright stance rather than a bent-forward pose. The arms are depicted as flexed and muscular, with no indication of supporting the body. This visual information, combined with general knowledge about human poses, leads to the conclusion that the figure is not in a bent-forward pose.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a circular emblem with wavy internal lines located on the chest of the central figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure does not exhibit a distinct circular emblem with wavy internal lines on the chest area. The design is more abstract and colorful, focusing on various geometric patterns rather than specific emblems. This observation suggests that such an emblem is not present.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the central figure enclosed within a diamond-shaped geometric frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict the central figure within a diamond-shaped frame. The design is highly abstract, with swirling patterns and vibrant colors filling the space around the figure, rather than forming a geometric enclosure. This analysis is based on the absence of any diamond-shaped border in the visual.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a floral motif located in the top-left corner of the design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a colorful background without any clear representation of floral motifs in the top-left corner or elsewhere. The design is characterized by abstract, wavy patterns, and bright colors rather than specific motifs like flowers.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, no explicit star symbols are present near the shoulders of the central figure. The design is again abstract with no distinctive star-like shapes visible in the described area.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure is characterized by geometric and bold color patterns, without visible depiction of hair, especially not long and wavy hair flowing over the shoulders. The emphasis is more on abstract forms than on realistic human features like hair.",
