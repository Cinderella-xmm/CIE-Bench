      "question": "Is the \"POLICE\" and \"CME\" text present on the driver’s side door in the same position and font style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'PALICE' is on the driver’s side door, which differs from the correct 'POLICE' text seen in Image A. The existing text also does not contain 'CME'. The font style in Image B is blocky and constructed from plastic bricks, mimicking construction toy style rather than the standard police car font style in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the gold-colored badge emblem with a shield and star design located on the driver’s side door?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a badge emblem is present on the driver's side door; however, it is built from bricks to simulate the appearance of such an emblem, with less detail due to the nature of the medium. Comparing to Image A, where the badge is more realistic and detailed, it's clear that Image B's representation is stylized and less accurate.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the rooftop light bar have the exact red-blue-red-blue color sequence from left to right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rooftop light bar is composed of brick pieces in a red-blue sequence but consists of a single block of red followed by a block of blue, not alternating like in Image A. The sequence in Image A is red-blue-red-blue representing a real police light bar pattern, which is more detailed and closer together.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the front grille composed of horizontal slats with a central chrome bar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a front grille with a uniform black brick pattern, which is not composed of horizontal slats with a central chrome bar as seen in Image A. The clay-brick design of Image B signifies the limitations of using toy bricks for detail.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the license plate displaying \"LIP\" above \"CHICAGO POLICE\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the license plate does not contain discernible text; the small LEGO pieces do not recreate such detail compared to the license plate in Image A, which reads 'LIP' above 'CHICAGO POLICE'. This indicates Image B's more abstract representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a four-door car silhouette constructed from toy bricks, mimicking the basic shape and layout of a sedan including the division of hood, cabin, and trunk. While the detail is less sophisticated than in Image A due to the construction toy style, the essential structure remains recognizable.",
      "weight": 2,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the representation of headlights and turn signals is done through the use of colored bricks depicting the general positioning found in Image A. They are positioned symmetrically, indicating the headlights' and turn signals' typical layout even in a simplified toy version.",
