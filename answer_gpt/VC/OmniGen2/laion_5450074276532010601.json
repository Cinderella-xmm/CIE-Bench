      "question": "Is the \"Schildkröt\" brand name visible on the ball box and/or paddle surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on the visual elements present. The image includes speech bubbles with text, but no obvious depiction of a box or paddle that might contain a brand name like \"Schildkröt.\" Instead, the image portrays graphic illustrations related to ping pong. Thus, there is no indication of the \"Schildkröt\" brand name on the ball box or paddle surface.",

      "question": "Are the paddles clearly depicted with one red rubber surface and one blue rubber surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays an animated style depiction with a paddle. It features a paddle with a red rubber surface but doesn't explicitly depict a blue rubber surface on any paddles. The content emphasizes adventure and enthusiasm rather than explicit display of equipment details.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a singular paddle is visible, and there’s no detail suggesting the presence of a diamond-shaped logo on the handle. The emphasis is on exploration and quest, without intricate representation of paddle logos.",

      "question": "Are exactly two paddles included in the set?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B visually focuses on the notion of adventure with one paddle visible and animated elements. There is no indication of two paddles being included in any sort of set presented in the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains animated characters and objects but lacks the depiction of a physical box or rope handle. The creative graphical content prioritizes thematic storytelling over realistic object representation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a horizontal partition inside the box that separates and holds the paddles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no box depicted in Image B that could hold paddles or any partition separating elements. The visual setup revolves around adventure and exploration, not physical storage solutions for paddles.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the box have a rectangular shape with a hinged lid that opens upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a treasure chest-like box is present, displaying a lid opening upward. Although this animation-style box is not typical for paddle storage, it loosely reflects a hinged structure. Thus, it matches the criteria for upward-opening lid with resemblance to a rectangular shape.",
