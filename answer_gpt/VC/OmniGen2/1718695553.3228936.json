      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the hippo and the beach ball without any visible knitted texture or distinct stitches.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The beach ball in Image B displays red, yellow, and white stripes. However, the stripes are not horizontal; instead, they are arranged in a curved pattern around the surface of the ball, resembling the design typically found on a beach ball. Therefore, while the colors are correct, the orientation described as horizontal does not match the visual provided.",
