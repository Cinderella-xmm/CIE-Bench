    "Question": "Q2: Are the control buttons labeled 'OFF' (red), 'ON' (green), and 'PULSE' (blue) arranged horizontally on the base?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the control buttons are visible on the packaging as part of the product depiction illustration, but they are not physically present on the food processor that sits atop the box. However, the depiction on the box matches the description: 'OFF' (red), 'ON' (green), and 'PULSE' (blue) buttons arranged horizontally. This horizontal arrangement is typical for ergonomic convenience and may be represented in illustrations for clear understanding of functionality.",

    "Question": "Q6: Is the base of the food processor silver metallic with black feet at the bottom corners?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the physical processor is not visible except for the bowl and lid.

    "Question": "Q7: Does the food processor maintain the same proportional relationship between the base, bowl, and feed tube as shown in the original image?",
    "explanation": "Comparing Image A and B involves assessing the physical depiction and the proportions of the components. In Image A, the bowl, base, and feed tube are actually part of the physical product, showing well-balanced proportions ensuring functionality. Image B, however, utilizes packaging illustrations to depict these proportions due to the bowl being only visibly present atop a box. It seems to maintain visual consistency in terms of shape and size reflected through its illustration on the box, but not through the physical components seen.",
    "answer": "No"
