      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no clock present, as the focus is on the cat sitting on a couch holding a remote. Therefore, no clock-related text can be visible in this image. This conclusion is drawn by observing the absence of any clock features in the image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a cat sitting on a couch, there are no visible clocks or clock faces in this image. Therefore, the question about Roman numerals on a clock face does not apply. This assessment is based on visual content analysis, confirming the absence of a clock.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene captures a cat on a couch indoors, with no clock visible. The absence of any post or clock supports the conclusion that there is no tall, ornate metal post in the scene. This conclusion is based on the lack of such visual elements in the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is set indoors, depicting a cat on a couch, which doesn't provide an outdoor backdrop of the ocean or sky. Thus, there is no clock positioned against any such backdrop within this image. The reasoning is confirmed by the indoor setting and absence of outdoor features.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no clock present in Image B. Instead, the image shows a cat sitting indoors. Since there is no clock, the question of its orientation does not arise. The determination is made by observing the content of the image and noting the absence of a clock.",
