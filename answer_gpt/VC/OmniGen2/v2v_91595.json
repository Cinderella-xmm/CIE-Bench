      "question": "Is the \"Nikon\" logo clearly visible on the top of the camera body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the logo on the top of the camera body is altered, and it reads 'NOVI' instead of 'Nikon,' which indicates that the original logo has been edited. The visibility of the 'Nikon' logo as such is not present, so it cannot be considered clearly visible.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the \"Nikon D800\" text visible on the back label of the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text on the back label appears distorted or altered, rendering it illegible. Since the original text 'Nikon D800' is not discernible, it indicates that it is not visible in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the battery compartment door open and hinged on the left side of the camera body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the battery compartment door open, revealing the interior and hinging on the left side, similar to the general configuration recognized in camera designs. Through the visual observation, it can be concluded that the compartment door is indeed open and hinged on the left side.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the orange plastic tab visible inside the battery compartment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the battery compartment interior doesn't display the orange plastic tab that is typically used to assist with battery removal, instead showing distinctive features such as a feather-like appearance. Therefore, the orange tab is not visible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the same battery model as Image A is positioned outside the compartment, next to the opening, indicating it is not fully inserted but rather partially or about to be inserted. The visual confirms the battery is partially inserted.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the camera with a consistent matte black finish across the surface, a common characteristic for DSLR cameras due to its aesthetic and functional benefits, such as reducing reflections. This observation allows the conclusion of a matte black finish being retained.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handgrip area of the camera appears to have a textured surface, typical for enhanced grip and comfort, a characteristic often found in DSLR camera designs specifically for holding purposes. The visual detail confirms the presence of the rubber grip.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the camera front where the lens mount is designed, and centered with a prominent silver metallic ring. This element serves as the mounting point for attaching camera lenses, confirming its visibility and central positioning.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the label on the camera does not maintain the clarity of 'MADE IN JAPAN' text and the serial number '6003450.' These elements seem altered or missing, indicating neither is visible.",
