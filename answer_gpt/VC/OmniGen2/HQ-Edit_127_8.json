      "question": "Is the knight wearing a crown with multiple pointed spires on his head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knight is inside a snow globe-like structure. The crown on his head is visible and features multiple pointed spires, which is a typical design for a medieval-style crown. This is identified by observing the distinct sharp, pointed elements protruding upwards from the band encircling the knight’s head.",

      "question": "Is there a long red cloak with gold trim draped over the knight’s left shoulder and trailing behind him?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knight is depicted with a long red cloak that extends from his left shoulder and trails behind him on the ground. The cloak appears to have gold trim, which adds a decorative element typical of regal attire. The color and the way it lays over the shoulder and trails signify its length and style.",

      "question": "Is the knight holding a longsword in his right hand, resting it on the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knight is indeed depicted with a longsword held in his right hand, with the tip of the sword resting on the ground. This is evident from the positioning of the sword straight down towards the ground and the posture of the knight as he holds it.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there two arched niches on either side of the central gate, each containing a relief sculpture of an armored figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knight and other elements are enclosed within a snow globe, and the background architecture is simplified into two towers. Unlike typical roman arches or niches, there are no distinct arched structures with relief sculptures of armored figures visible next to each gate tower. Instead, a simplified snowy globe setting is used.",

      "question": "Is there an armored figure standing atop the battlement, holding a red banner with a golden emblem?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no distinct armored figures seen standing atop the battlements holding a banner. The snow globe structure covers the scene, showing only the central knight figure and the towers. Features like figure details holding banners are absent.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knight is positioned inside the snow globe and faces right in a side profile view. The positioning and orientation are consistent with such descriptions as observed by his profile displaying one side of his body and the direction towards which he faces.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe encompasses a simplified structure of the towers without distinct details of banners atop the battlements. Although the design shows flags on the towers, these do not match the detailed description of a red banner with a golden emblem as required. The prominence and details of such a banner are absent.",
