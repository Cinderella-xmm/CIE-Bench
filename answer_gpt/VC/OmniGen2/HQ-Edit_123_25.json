      "question": "Is the silver filigree hairpin shaped like a branching plant with delicate leaf-like extensions still present in the hair bun?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not depict any hair bun or hairpin, as the focus is on the dress illustrations and design. The elements shown in the image are a dress, drawings, and design patterns rather than an actual person with accessories like a hairpin. Thus, the hairpin is not visible in the edited image.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image includes an illustration of bamboo stalks on one of the papers or canvases. These bamboo stalks are not part of a background behind a subject but are instead part of a design concept. Therefore, they are visible within the image context as a separate element.",

      "explanation": "The edited image shows a dress design with a high collar, but it does not feature long sleeves. Instead, the dress depicted has short sleeves and detailed embroidery. Thus, long sleeves with seam lines are not present in the garment illustration.",
