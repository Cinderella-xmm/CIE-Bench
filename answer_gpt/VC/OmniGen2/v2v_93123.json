      "question": "Does the elderly man retain his white hair and mustache?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly man's white hair is clearly visible, suggesting that his white hair is retained. However, since the face is blurred, the presence of a mustache cannot be confirmed. Despite this, the consistent hairstyle strongly indicates that the essential features such as his hair remain unchanged.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the pineapple distinctly displays its spiky green leaves and the textured golden-brown skin, typical of a mature pineapple. This visual information affirms that the pineapple's appearance is the same.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly man's head remains oriented towards the pineapple. Given the previous pose with his focus directed at the object beside him, it is reasonable to infer that he continues gazing contemplatively in the same direction.",
