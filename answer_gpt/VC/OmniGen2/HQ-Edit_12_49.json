    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the baroque-style scrollwork and acanthus leaf motifs present and accurately reproduced in the same positions and forms as in the original clock frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, on the watch box, we see ornate decorations that resemble elements of Baroque style, such as scrollwork. However, these designs are simplified and do not match the complexity or precise forms of the original clock’s ornaments in Image A, which showcase elaborate acanthus leaf and Baroque motifs surrounding the clock frame.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the symmetrical arrangement of the top and bottom finials and side scrollwork preserved exactly as in the original clock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, which is a watch box, presents ornate decorations; however, it lacks the top, bottom, and side finials that are symmetrically arranged around the clock in Image A. The original clock frame features a distinctly symmetrical arrangement of decorations while the watch box in Image B shows different placements and lacks such detailed symmetry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the rich mahogany tone and visible wood grain texture of the frame preserved in the packaging design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a wooden watch box exhibiting a deep mahogany tone with visible wood grain, similar to the clock frame in Image A. The wood texture and color seen in the watch box are consistent with those of the clock frame, showcasing a preserved aesthetic.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the distressed gold finish of the clock face preserved in the watch face within the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch face appears polished and lacks the distressed appearance seen in the clock face of Image A. The original clock face has a weathered gold finish, whereas the watch face looks newer and shinier, indicating the distressed gold finish is not preserved.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the black Roman numerals (I–XII) present in the same positions and style as in the original clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The watch face in Image B retains black Roman numerals in the same positions as the clock face in Image A. Both the clock and watch feature these numerals encircling their face in the classic style, thus preserving this element accurately between both images.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the inscriptions \"2010\" and \"2012\" present in the same positions on the clock/watch face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The inscriptions '2010' and '2012' appear on the clock face in Image A, strategically placed around the center of the dial. In Image B, these inscriptions are similarly positioned on the watch face, suggesting consistency in placement and preserving this detail between the two images.",
