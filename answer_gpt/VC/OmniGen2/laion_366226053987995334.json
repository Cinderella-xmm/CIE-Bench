      "question": "Is the overall shape of each earring a symmetrical, elongated feather with pointed tips at both ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the earrings are represented as cartoonish, elongated feathers, suggestive of a symmetrical design. The bottom end of each feather is pointed, as is conventionally seen in feather designs. Observing Image A confirms this symmetrical feather shape as seen in its metallic form. The stylized depictions maintain this shape. Therefore, the cartoon representation retains the symmetry and elongation of a traditional feather shape.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does each earring contain a centrally located oval black stone set within a metallic bezel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B modifies the central oval to show a smiley face but maintains the central oval shape with the bezel as in Image A. Initially, one might interpret Image B's black circle with a smiley face as a decorative change rather than eliminating the stone. However, the earrings in Image A clearly have a centrally located oval black element within a metallic bezel, which aligns with Image B's oval shape, albeit artistically altered.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there fine, parallel engraved lines extending outward from the central spine on both sides of the feather?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lines on the feather mimic a set of parallel engravings extending from the spine outward, characteristic of feather detailing. Image A shows these lines precisely, matching the typical pattern of feather engravings for realism and aesthetics. Both images reflect this feature consistently, with Image B's simplified but recognizable depiction.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the metal of the earrings rendered in a silver tone with a matte or slightly oxidized (antiqued) finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the earrings appear to be depicted in a silver tone, reflecting the metallic nature as seen in Image A. The simplified cartoon style does not allow detailed assessment of finish, but the stylized silver appearance implies likeness to a typical metal finish common in antiqued or matte designs seen in jewelry. Image A suggests a silver with possible antiqued qualities, leading to the conclusion that the depiction in Image B follows suit.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does each earring include a curved hook earwire connected via a small spherical bead to the main feather body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The earrings in Image B have hooks drawn to indicate earwires. They connect to the earrings through a defined segment resembling a bead, just as in traditional earring structures seen in Image A. This element in Image B mirrors that in Image A, showing the connection with a bead juncture between the hook and feather body, demonstrating consistency in depiction style.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the two earrings identical in shape, size, and orientation, mirrored across a vertical axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows duplicates whose shapes, sizes, and orientations are mirror images of each other along a vertical axis. Image A similarly presents identical earrings, supporting this mirrored depiction. Thus, both images appear to confirm identical and symmetrical attributes through their orientation and proportions.",
