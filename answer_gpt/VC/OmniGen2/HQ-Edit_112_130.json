      "question": "Is the violin clearly present under the woman’s chin, held by her left hand, with the bow drawn across the strings by her right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman holds the violin under her chin, applying the standard violin-playing posture.

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both arms positioned correctly to support violin playing—left arm holding the instrument, right arm moving the bow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman in Image B adopts a typical violin-playing stance. Her left arm is raised and positioned under the violin's neck while her hand clutches it, allowing for support and finger positioning on the strings. Her right arm moves the bow across the strings, a standard action in playing the violin. This indicates proper arm positioning for playing the instrument.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face is blurred in Image B, which complicates interpreting the woman's expression or whether her eyes are closed or opened. Thus, I cannot ascertain this detail from the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman stands with her body facing somewhat toward the viewer, aligning the upper body and the violin with a posture typical of a performance position. The position fits the expected posture for playing the violin, where the performer often slightly angles forward to engage with the viewer or audience.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bow in the woman's right hand is noticeably poised across the violin strings. This positioning signals active movement along the strings, necessary for eliciting sound from the instrument, thus showing visible contact.",
