        "yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, we can see that the character's collar and cuffs are designed with intricate lace detailing. The lace appears to be a bright color, which contrasts with the darker dress color, highlighting its presence. This matches with typical Victorian-style clothing where lace was commonly used. Based on visual observation and common fashion knowledge, we can confirm that the lacework is indeed detailed. Thus, the edited image retains the detailed lacework seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the puffed sleeves and fitted bodice design?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sleeves are visibly puffed, which was a common feature in historical fashion for giving garments a structured, voluminous appearance. Furthermore, the bodice appears to be form-fitting, accentuating the character's silhouette. These design elements are consistent with Victorian-era style dress where both puffed sleeves and fitted bodices were characteristic aesthetic features. The image successfully captures these elements, indicating they are maintained in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a character with a skirt that flares from the waist. This is a prominent feature in many traditional dresses, especially in the Victorian era, where women often wore dresses with wide skirts supported by crinolines or hoops. The visual presentation in the edited image maintains this aspect of the skirt, suggesting it remains unchanged compared to the original image.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "When examining Image B, the fabric of the dress does not display any visible floral pattern or texture. It appears to be a solid color, missing the intricate textures or designs typically seen if a fabric has such patterning. Since no floral pattern is evident, it indicates that this detail has not been preserved in the edited image.",

        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible line of buttons running down the front of the bodice. This feature is common in many period dresses for ornamental and functional purposes. The absence of such closures in the edited image suggests that this detail was not retained.",
