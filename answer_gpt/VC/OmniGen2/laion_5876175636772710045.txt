    "Question": "Q1: Is the man's left arm still wrapped around the woman's back, supporting her in a ballroom dance hold?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the man is standing upright, and his left arm is visible at his side. He is not in a dance position with the woman. In a ballroom dance hold, the man's left arm would typically be wrapping around the woman's back to maintain the dance posture, which is not observed here.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the woman's right hand remain on the man's left shoulder?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is standing next to the man without engaging in a dance posture. Her arms are both relaxed by her sides, and there is no contact between her right hand and the man's left shoulder. In a ballroom dance hold, we would expect her right hand to be resting on his shoulder, which is not the case here.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the woman's back arched backward with her right leg lifted off the ground?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is standing with a straight posture, dressed in a historical costume. Her right leg is visibly on the ground, and she is not in any dance pose where her back would be arched. The overall posture is upright, typical of formal standing without movement.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the man positioned with his back to the viewer while the woman faces slightly toward the camera?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both individuals are facing toward the camera. The man is turned slightly toward the woman without his back facing the viewer, and both positioned for a portrait, which is different from a dynamic dance pose where the man's back might be to the camera.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the woman's long blonde hair flow outward to the right side of the frame?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's hair is styled neatly and is not flowing outward. Her hair is mostly tied back, appearing in controlled waves around her shoulders rather than dynamically flowing to one side, which reflects a formal portrait setting rather than a dance movement.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the man's left foot forward and the woman's right heel raised off the ground?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both individuals are standing with their feet evenly on the ground, typical of a formal standing posture. There is no visible forward motion in the man's left foot, nor is the woman's right heel raised, both standing flat-footed.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the woman's head tilted upward with her eyes looking toward the upper left of the frame?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's head is level, facing forward in alignment with her body posture. Her gaze does not appear to be directed toward the upper left, indicative of a focused, forward-facing pose for a portrait, as opposed to an expressive dance movement.",
    "answer": "No"
