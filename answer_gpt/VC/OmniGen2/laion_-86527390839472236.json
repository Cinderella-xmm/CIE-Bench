    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the original seam lines (including those around the front pocket and vertical panel divisions) preserved as embossed linear patterns on the transformed glass vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed object appears to be a glass vessel without visible seam lines or embossed patterns that reflect any form of stitching. The front surface is smooth without any intricate linear designs that resemble seams or divisions. In contrast, Image A clearly displays seam lines on a fabric suitcase, particularly around the front pocket and throughout the vertical panel divisions. Comparing both images, the transformed glass vessel does not incorporate these seam lines as linear patterns. The reasoning involves recognizing types of materials and finishes commonly associated with glass versus textile products.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the brand logo positioned near the top center of the front face of the transformed object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brand logo is visible near the top center of the transformed object, a purple glass surface. This is a typical placement for a logo to ensure visibility and brand recognition. In Image A, the brand logo is similarly located at the top center of the suitcase's front, demonstrating consistency in branding. Recognizing typical logo placement strategies helps draw this conclusion.",

      "question": "Is the metallic spray nozzle located at the top center of the object, aligned vertically with the original handle’s position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a transformed object resembling a glass container, yet it does not include a metallic spray nozzle. There is a handle at the top similar to the original suitcase in Image A. In Image A, the handle is prominent and centers at the top. Without a metallic spray nozzle visible, the alignment question becomes irrelevant as the handle’s placement aligns with the original but lacks any nozzle.",

      "question": "Are four decorative caps present at the base corners of the transformed object, corresponding to the original wheel positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the original wheel positions from Image A, but they're depicted as decorative caps at the base corners of the glass structure rather than functional wheels. Both images exhibit elements at these positions, suggesting a retention of design layout from the suitcase. Knowledge of typical decorative transformations guides this understanding.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the two zipper tracks of the front pocket preserved as linear features on the transformed object, maintaining their parallel alignment and position within the front panel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed object lacks any linear features representing zipper tracks. The surface is smooth and unembellished aside from the brand logo, with no indications of zipper track lines or parallel alignment visible. In Image A, zipper tracks are visible around the front pocket, which are absent in the transformation. Material and design transformations typically simplify visual elements, supporting this conclusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is a handle present on the right side of the transformed object, corresponding to the original side handle’s position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a handle on the right side, similar to the original product in Image A, indicating a preservation of functional design elements. Both images show handles in the same positional context, lending credibility to the conclusion of maintaining key transport features. Understanding typical object features aids this assessment.",
