      "question": "Is the orange circular logo with the white animal figure clearly visible on the sack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sack is illustrated with a logo and text, likely meant to represent branding or information. The details in a stylized or cartoon version may differ from the real-life image due to artistic choices and simplification. The original, Image A, shows a more distinct and detailed logo on the sack due to the photographic nature. However, the logo's clarity depends on how accurately and detailed it is drawn in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the worker’s right hand visibly reaching into the tea bush to pick leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the worker's right hand is visible, tending to the tea plants, which is commonly depicted in illustrations to show action being taken, such as picking. Comparatively, in Image A, the worker's hand is seen performing this action clearly in the photograph. Both images portray the hand in a picking motion, but Image B’s stylized form slightly alters the direct interpretation due to artistic representation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a stylized worker with a forward-leaning posture, indicated by the position of the arms and alignment of the upper body toward the tea bushes, signifying engagement in work such as picking. This is compared to Image A, where the worker’s body is clearly bent forward over the plants, showing physical engagement in a practical manner.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration shows a sack hanging on the worker, reflecting a common placement for carrying collected tea leaves. The comparison to Image A, a photo of the worker, shows the sack clearly positioned on the side of their waist and hanging down, used for harvesting. Based on world knowledge about tea harvesting, the depiction aligns with practice, yet specifics may vary slightly due to artistic depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses stylized diagonal rows to suggest a sloping tea plantation terrain, a typical arrangement in agricultural illustrations for clarity. Image A shows the actual arrangement of tea plants in precise diagonal rows across the slope, an efficient layout for drainage and sun exposure in farming. Thus, the comparison confirms their portrayal of farming design.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted with a long-sleeved olive-green shirt, a common choice for labor-oriented tasks providing coverage and protection. Comparing to Image A, it captures the worker in a similar garment, emphasizing practical attire for fieldwork.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artistic depiction of the character's hair may show a simplified hairstyle, like a ponytail, typical for maintaining neatness while working. In contrast, Image A clearly shows a low ponytail with some strands, a realistic representation due to everyday working conditions. The stylized image may lack some specific details like loose strands due to its format.",
