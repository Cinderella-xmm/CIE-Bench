    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the subject's facial expression, including a wide smile showing teeth and eyes looking upward to the left, preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, although we do not see the facial expression due to the blurred facial area, there are no obvious indications from the body language or context that the expression was preserved or altered. Based on the blurred face, the specific expression cannot be confirmed.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the subject's head turned slightly to the left, maintaining the original angle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head orientation suggests a slight turn to the left, similar to Image A, given the posture and position of the body. Without a visible reference due to the blurred face, the head's orientation still generally corresponds to the left side, which is consistent.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the subject's hands clasped gently in front of the torso, with fingers interlaced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the subject's hands are positioned gently in front of the torso with a clasped appearance. However, instead of being interlaced, the fingers seem to maintain a parallel alignment, indicating a slight modification from being fully interlaced.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the henna designs visible on the subject's palms and fingers preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the palms and fingers do not display any henna designs. This indicates that the henna motifs, if present in the original, have not been preserved in the edited version.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and skin tone observed in the visible areas such as the arms, are consistent with a natural tone. The shoulders and arms reflect uniform lighting that complements the environment.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the hair appears to be long, dark, and wavy, draping over the shoulders, consistent with any original depiction of similar traits due to style and positioning over the shoulders.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
