      "question": "Is the circular logo featuring a navy blue \"C\" shape with a red semicircle at the top present on the front of the energy drink can?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area where a logo might appear prominently on a product like an energy drink can is observed. However, the visual inspection shows a text-based logo 'Kickstart' on this product, with no indication of a circular logo with a 'C' and red semicircle as described. In Image A, such a logo is clearly visible on the side of the shoe. Given the absence of this specific logo in Image B, we determine that the described logo is not present.",

      "question": "Does the energy drink can feature the navy blue mesh texture across its main body surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the main body of the object, which should resemble the surface of a can, visually matches a textured, navy blue mesh, similar to fabric. This texture is consistent with the mesh texture observed on the shoe from Image A. Such textures are typically not found on drink cans, indicating considerable editing to apply this mesh style in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the navy blue laces depicted as raised embossed ridges wrapping around the middle section of the can in their original crisscross pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, it is visually noticeable that navy blue laces appear as raised, embossed elements on the main surface. They are arranged in a crisscross pattern resembling that on shoes. In Image A, these laces are indeed a part of the shoe's design, crisscrossing in the center. The continuity of their placement and style in Image B affirms their resemblance to the shoe's laces in Image A.",

      "question": "Are three navy blue stripes arranged horizontally across the lower portion of the can, matching the original shoe's stripe layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays three navy blue stripes along the lower section of the object. These stripes are presented in a horizontal manner, echoing the similar stripe pattern found on the shoe in Image A. This kind of design, commonly associated with shoe branding, has been adapted into the image of the can, aligning consistently with the shoe's layout.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the word \"Kickstart\" displayed in red lettering on the upper portion of the can?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top section of the object prominently displays the word 'Kickstart' in red lettering. This contrasts with Image A, where no such text is present, as it is a shoe rather than a can. The presence of this text element indicates a clear edit to integrate the brand 'Kickstart' in the design.",
