      "question": "Is the dorsal ridge composed of a series of raised, looped structures running along the back of the pig?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dorsal area of the pig shows a smooth surface with an engraved floral pattern instead of raised, looped structures. Observing this visually, there is no evidence of a ridge or looped structures akin to what one might find in a knitted or crochet design. Contrastingly, if applying this structure to Image A, a clearly visible knitted dorsal looped pattern exists, suggesting that Image B does not match this description.",

      "question": "Does the tail extend from the rear of the pig and terminate in a fluffy pom-pom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig features a smooth, rounded tail that is part of its plastic or ceramic-like material design. The tail is not fluffy, nor does it terminate in a pom-pom but rather ends in a small, rounded curl. Therefore, there is no evidence of a fluffy pom-pom tail in Image B, which contrasts with the pom-pom tail evident in the knitted structure of Image A.",

      "question": "Are there four short legs attached beneath the body, two on each side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a pig with a clearly visible set of four short, distinct legs evenly positioned beneath its body, two on each side. This is a conventional representation of a pig's anatomy, where such structures are typical regardless of artistic style. The observation confirms the leg count and placement as conventional, unlike Image A, which features knitted legs with a different texture but similar placement.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the pig has a rounded snout protruding forward, which aligns with the typical anatomical structure of pigs. This feature is consistent and clear, shown in a vibrant color and smooth texture that aligns with common representations. Comparatively, Image A also has a rounded snout in the knitted form, reinforcing this view.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig features two small, clearly distinguished upright ears adorning its head. These ears are symmetrically placed at the top and are visually distinct due to their elevated position and detailed depiction. The design of these ears serves a decorative purpose and fits the traditional cute portrayal of pigs, similar to the knitted ears present in Image A.",
