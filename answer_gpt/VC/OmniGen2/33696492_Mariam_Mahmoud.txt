    "Question": "Q1: Are there exactly three chairs positioned in a row, facing the bookshelf wall?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are two distinct chairs visible positioned facing the bookshelf wall. Commonly, chairs arranged in a row can be seen easily by viewing alignment; however, here there are clearly two chairs visible, not three. Even with overlaps, it's not possible to visually infer the presence of a third chair. The arrangement in Image B results in only two chairs being apparent.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are there two hanging pendant lights located above the seating area, one closer to the center and one toward the right edge of the frame?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are four hanging pendant lights visible: one in the center, two to the right of the center, and one to the left near the edge. This arrangement exceeds the two light requirement of the question, and there are no lights distinctly nearer the center and exactly to the right edge fitting just two in count.",

    "Question": "Q3: Does the floor display a pattern of parallel diagonal shadows cast by sunlight entering from the right side?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is artificial as indicated by the warm, even illumination, and there are no strong sunlight patterns making diagonal shadows on the floor. There are dappled sunlight and shadow effects typical from an ambient lighting setting from lamps, but these don't come from sunlight and thus no diagonal shadows from a real sunlight source as per the description.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is there a full-height wall of wooden shelves running along the left side of the room, divided into multiple evenly spaced rectangular compartments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a full-height wooden shelf that runs along what appears primarily the rear wall rather than the left side. The bookshelf is partitioned into rectangular compartments evenly spaced. Thus, while the description fits except for it being identified as positioned on the left side wall when it is instead on the rear wall.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the floor composed of light-colored wooden planks laid horizontally, extending from foreground to background?",
    "explanation": "The floor in Image B is composed of medium-toned wooden planks that appear to run lengthwise rather than horizontally. The lighting casts warm shadows from artificial sources, indicating that the hue is an intrinsic property of the image capture rather than a reflection from external lighting. The description of light-colored wooden planks laid horizontally doesn't apply.",
    "answer": "No"
