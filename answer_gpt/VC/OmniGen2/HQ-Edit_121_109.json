      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the red hummingbird feeder is present with a transparent cylindrical reservoir and red base. The form and position appear to match the description, as it hangs on the right side of the image, closely resembling the form in Image A. After analyzing Image A, the feeder also appears the same, confirming its consistency in position and form between both images.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the side of a house on the right with a gray-blue tone partially covered in green ivy, but not fully. Comparison with Image A, where the ivy covers the house similarly, indicates that the description of being fully covered is incorrect.",
