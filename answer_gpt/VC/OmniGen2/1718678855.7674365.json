      "question": "Is the capybara’s snout broad and flat with a rounded muzzle, consistent with its real-world anatomy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara's snout appears broad, flat, and rounded, which aligns with the typical characteristics of a capybara's snout in the real world. This conclusion is drawn from the visual cues in the image where the snout shows these attributes, combining with the known anatomy of capybaras. Therefore, the snout in Image B reflects realistic anatomy.",

      "question": "Are the capybara’s ears small, rounded, and located high on the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara's ears are visually small and rounded, positioned high on the head. These features are consistent with the real-world anatomy of capybaras, which typically have ears that are small and rounded, situated high to ensure good hearing while swimming. The location and appearance of the ears in the image align well with the known traits of capybaras.",

      "question": "Is the capybara standing upright and facing directly toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara is indeed standing upright and facing directly toward the viewer. This is evident from its posture, where it appears positioned against a backdrop, suggesting it is standing in a posed manner. Normally, capybaras are quadrupeds; however, the artistic depiction in the image shows it upright, allowing a clear view directly ahead toward the viewer.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the capybara with both hands positioned in front of its chest, visibly gripping an object, specifically a cup. This observation is based on the visual cues where the hands are curved around the handle of the cup, suggesting an intentional pose as though holding or sipping from it. This placement and action match the description.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the capybara’s fur primarily light brown with darker tones around the muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara's fur color appears predominantly light brown, with a slightly darker shade around the muzzle area. This description is matched by examining the overall coloration depicted in the image, where the body maintains a light brown tone, and the muzzle area offers a darker contrast, mimicking typical capybara fur coloration seen in nature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the capybara have a stocky, large body with short legs and a thick torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara exhibits a body that appears stocky and large, but its legs are concealed by its posture, focusing mostly on the upper body. The torso's depiction is thick, which aligns with the known physical characteristics of capybaras, which are large rodents with robust bodies. Without visible legs, the assumption is they are short, adding to the stocky perception.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the capybara have four limbs visible or implied by posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, only the upper limbs (hands) are prominently visible due to the capybara's upright posture and focus on holding the cup. The lower limbs are not visible or implied, as the body is aligned to show its torso and face toward the viewer. Therefore, the posture does not clearly imply four limbs.",
