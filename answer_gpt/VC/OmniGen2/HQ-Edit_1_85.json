      "question": "Is the girl’s long dark hair with bangs present and extending past her shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a simple illustration is used, representing the girl with long brown hair, not particularly characterized by dark color, and it extends past her shoulders. It is drawn in a straightforward manner typical of digital or vector art, suggesting a distinct style that doesn't match the realistic depiction in Image A which features dark brown hair. Thus, Image B does not represent long dark hair with bangs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl is depicted in a blouse with lace details. The illustration includes details indicating lace trim on the clothing.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is an illustration, showing the girl wearing a blouse, but details about a black pleated skirt are not visible, as the focus is more on the upper part of her body and background elements than detailed attire. Considering the stylistic depiction and lack of specific skirt representation in Image B, it does not show a black pleated skirt extending below the waistline.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a flat background with musical sheets behind the girl. Unlike Image A, there is no indication of an arched window emitting diffused light; the illustration focuses more on the musical elements and the character, without any architectural elements like a window.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the space around the girl is filled with musical sheets rather than objects, and typical items like candlesticks are absent from this version. It appears as a simplified art piece focusing more on the girl and music rather than additional thematic objects as seen in Image A.",

      "explanation": "Image B is an illustration with less lifelike facial details, especially since the face is blurred. It does not depict a downward or focused gaze, given the blurred area where the face details would be intricate emotional expressions are not possible in this version.",
