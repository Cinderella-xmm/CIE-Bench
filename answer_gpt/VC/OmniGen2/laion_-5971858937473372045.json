      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows five women in total, not three. This is evident from the positioning and count of bodies present in the scene with distinct clothing styles, suggesting more than three women are present.",

        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central woman is flanked by two additional women on either side rather than just two women. Based on the symmetrical arrangement and the total number of five women, the central woman is not directly between just two women.",

      ],
