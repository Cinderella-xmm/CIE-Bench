    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the two visible dark brown wooden ceiling beams, one running diagonally and one vertically, present and positioned as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible wooden beams forming the ceiling structure. These beams visually match the original image in the sense of positioning, with the beams oriented in a similar fashion. The analysis is based on the consistency of the ceiling beams' wood pattern and alignment along the same lines noticed in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the white, hand-textured stucco wall visible on the left side of the image, showing irregular surface imperfections and subtle brushwork marks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the environment simulates a scene that strongly resembles an underwater setting rather than a room with walls. Instead of seeing a stucco wall, the image portrays an underwater ambiance with water reflections and marine elements. This result is derived from observing the lack of any structural wall features consistent with a hand-textured stucco surface.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the shadow pattern on the ceiling and wall composed of a radial, star-shaped lattice formed by the lantern’s cut-out design, matching the exact geometric configuration of the lantern’s panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadow produced does seem to have a radial symmetry typical of a star pattern, however it is reimagined as more organic, resembling a jellyfish structure. The visual cues indicate a transformation in elements, diverging from a fixed lattice design of the original lantern, leading to the conclusion that the pattern no longer matches Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the corner where the white wall meets the wooden ceiling clearly visible, forming a sharp right-angle edge at the upper left portion of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting does not include any visible structures suggesting the presence of a wall meeting a ceiling. This setting appears aquatic, lacking edge or angle elements indicative of architectural corners, thereby eliminating the presence of a sharp right-angle edge as visible in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the metal chain, consisting of small linked rings, visibly connecting the top of the lantern to the ceiling fixture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a chain securing the lantern structure to a connecting point (likely the ceiling fixture). Even with the lantern's thematic shift, the supporting chain maintains its utility and is visibly similar in connectivity to that in Image A, determined through observing its functional and visual consistency.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the light emanate from within the central chamber of the lantern, creating a bright focal point that radiates outward through the perforated panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the light still appears to originate from the center of the lantern-like object, casting outwards similarly to the original image. However, instead of passing through perforated metal panels, it now emanates through a translucent jellyfish-like form, understood from observing the transition of the lantern concept to an ethereal marine design.",
