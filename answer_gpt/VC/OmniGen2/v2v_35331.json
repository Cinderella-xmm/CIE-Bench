      "question": "Is the background composed of green grass with visible blades and natural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background clearly shows a surface composed of grass. The grass is green, with individual blades visible, creating a textured appearance that is typical of natural grass lawns or fields. The presence of these visible blades and the overall green color of the grass indicate a realistic portrayal of grass, contributing to a natural texture in the background.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there soft shadows cast by the subject(s) onto the grass, consistent with natural outdoor lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the light and shadow play observed around the dog and the banana are subtle, suggesting natural outdoor lighting. The shadows appear soft and diffuse, as would be expected under daylight conditions, rather than being harsh or overly defined. These shadows fall naturally on the grass, consistent with the outdoor scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the fused form positioned directly on the grass surface, with contact points visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog and the banana are placed on the grass, and their placement suggests direct contact with the surface. The lower parts of the banana and the dog's paws are aligned with the blades of grass, creating a sense of contact and integration with the scene.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the grass predominantly green with natural variations in shade and tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grass in Image B is predominantly green, with a natural appearance. There are variations in shade and tone, which contribute to the realistic and textured look of a grass surface. Such variations are typical and expected in a natural setting due to different light exposure and grass blade positioning.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the fused form incorporate both yellow and tan hues, reflecting the original banana and dog colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image features distinct entities: a dog and a banana, rather than a fused form. The dog presents tan hues, typical of its coat color, while the banana is a vibrant yellow. Both colors are maintained separately in their respective forms, aligned with their natural appearances rather than being fused into a singular form.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are individual blades of grass visible in the foreground and midground, contributing to a textured surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grass is detailed, with individual blades clearly visible, especially in the foreground and midground. This lends a textured appearance to the ground, enhancing the realistic portrayal of a grassy surface. The visibility of these blades is essential to conveying depth and texture.",
