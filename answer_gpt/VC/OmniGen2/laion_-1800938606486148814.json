      "question": "Is the Swoosh logo present in the same curved shape and located on the lateral side of the midsole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a logo that appears similar to the Nike Swoosh and has a distinct, angular design; it is placed on the lateral side of the shoe's midsole. However, this logo is not in the traditional curved shape. In Image A, the Swoosh logo is depicted in a classic, curved manner on the lateral side of the midsole. The comparison shows that the logo's positioning is similar, but the shape contrasts notably between the two images.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, there is indeed a horizontal strap across the midfoot of the shoe, evident by its distinct placement and secure design across the foot area of the sneaker.
