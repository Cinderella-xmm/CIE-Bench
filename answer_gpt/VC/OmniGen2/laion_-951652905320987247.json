      "question": "Is the mountain depicted as a symmetrical, perfectly conical shape with a pointed peak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain is depicted within a glass enclosure, and it appears as an idealized, symmetrical, and stylized mountain with a perfectly conical shape and a pointed peak, typical of artistic or decorative renderings. This conveys a sense of symmetry and perfection, often found in miniaturized or stylized models. Hence, considering the visual representation here, the mountain in Image B fits the description of a symmetrical, perfectly conical shape with a pointed peak.",

      "question": "Does the summit of the mountain have a continuous white snow cap covering the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the mountain includes a significant portion of the upper half covered in white, giving the appearance of a continuous snow cap at the summit. This suggests an idealized depiction where the snow is uninterrupted and evenly distributed, characteristic of stylized models. Thus, in this representation, the summit does have a continuous white snow cap.",

      "question": "Is there a clear, mirror-like reflection of the mountain in the lake below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a small, stylized lake reflecting the mountain, but due to the nature of the artistic rendering, it lacks the fidelity and detail that would create a clear, mirror-like reflection as seen in real landscapes. The representation is more symbolic, focusing on overall aesthetics rather than exact reflection properties. Therefore, the lake in this artistic depiction does not portray a clear, mirror-like reflection.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there small structures or buildings positioned along the edge of the lake, between the water and the mountain base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two small structures on the grassy area near the lake, which are depicted as small huts or cabins within the stylized setting. These structures are clearly positioned near the water's edge and closer to the base of the mountain within the enclosed scene, indicating that there are indeed small structures along the edge of the lake.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sky visible above the mountain, appearing as a solid or gradient blue area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background inside the glass enclosure provides a blue backdrop for the mountain scene. However, this blue area doesn't represent an open sky but rather a stylized environment without depth, as in a model or decorative item. This gives the appearance of a solid color area rather than the open, natural sky. Therefore, the sky in this context is not visible as a part of the outdoor scene but rather as a backdrop.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible layers on the mountainâ€™s slopes, showing a transition from white snow at the top to darker rock and then to green/brown vegetation below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain is portrayed with a snow-covered peak, followed by darker areas that suggest rock or terrain, and extending downward to a green base, which represents vegetation. This depiction follows the general understanding of how mountainous terrain transitions from snow to rock to vegetation, even though it is stylized. Therefore, there are indeed visible layers showing this transition, albeit in a simplified form.",
