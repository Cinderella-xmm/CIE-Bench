    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a central root node labeled or represented as \"HOMEPAGE\" positioned at the top center of the diagram?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, observe the top center of the diagram to identify the root node. World knowledge indicates that in a site architecture plan, the homepage is often the central starting point from which other nodes branch out. However, in Image B, the central node is not labeled as 'HOMEPAGE' but has some illegible text surrounded by nodes labeled 'Soonotogy,' 'Bag,' and 'Hootie.' Therefore, it does not appear to be a recognizable homepage.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there exactly five primary branches originating from the HOMEPAGE node, corresponding to PRODUCTS & SOLUTIONS, ABOUT US, EVENTS & RESOURCES, SUCCESS STORIES, and CONTACT US?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visually inspect for branches stemming from the central node at the top. There appear to be branches, but they are labeled differently. Items such as 'Bofotaf,' 'Hongfreeth,' 'Roefitverumre,' and 'OFT ragate' are present, indicating the renaming, reorganization, or representation of sections different from Image A. Thus, the structure does not match the specified sections.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a legend labeled \"SITE MAP KEY\" located in the bottom-right corner of the image, showing color codes for different levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examine the bottom-right corner of Image B for any legend-like structure that displays information about different levels. Instead of 'SITE MAP KEY,' Image B has a legend-like structure labeled 'TEENTING' with color codes. Given the differing label, it does not match the 'SITE MAP KEY' description.",

    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the top-left corner of Image B, visually verify the presence of a logo. Image B shows a logo labeled 'couhdvelt,' which differs from the 'to the web' logo identified in Image A. Therefore, the logo from Image A is absent in the edited image.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a FOOTER section containing \"Privacy Policy\" and \"Site Map\" below the main content area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Check the area below the main content in Image B for a section labeled 'FOOTER' or containing similar elements. Image B does not show a separate footer section with 'Privacy Policy' or 'Site Map.' The area is decorated with forest creatures and natural elements without these specific labels.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there exactly three nodes under the \"SUCCESS STORIES\" section, labeled or represented as Case Study #1, #2, and #3?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyze Image B for a section corresponding to 'SUCCESS STORIES' with specific nodes. Image B displays a section labeled 'OFT ragate,' containing nodes labeled as 'The swaley,' 'Kloet maad,' and 'Truple trav,' differing from the 'Case Study' nodes in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To confirm the presence of 'Product Details' under 'Product #3' in Image B, look for a section aligning with these labels from Image A. Image B has nodes such as 'Bomepie' and 'Amo gawlet' without the specific labels 'Product #3' or 'Product Details.' Therefore, it lacks this hierarchical arrangement.",
