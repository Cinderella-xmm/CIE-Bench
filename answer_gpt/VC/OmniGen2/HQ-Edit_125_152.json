      "question": "Are the orange fields with black veins and white spots along the wing margins present in the butterfly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's wings display vivid orange fields with distinct black veins. Along the wing margins, there are prominent white spots.

      "question": "Are there clearly defined white spots located along the outer edge of both forewings and hindwings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the butterfly with white spots distinctly outlined along the outer edges of both the forewings and hindwings. This is a common feature in species like the monarch butterfly, where such spots form part of their recognizable pattern.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the butterflyâ€™s body black with small white speckles distributed across it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's body is depicted as predominantly black with an even distribution of small white speckles. This is a typical pattern seen in monarch butterflies, which supports the described appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a flower with a spiky central cone and drooping petals beneath the butterfly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of a flower beneath the butterfly. Instead, the image shows the butterfly centered above a floral arrangement, but not resting on any single flower with specific features like a spiky central cone and drooping petals. This indicates the absence of the described flower beneath the butterfly.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the butterfly positioned directly above the flower, with its legs touching the bloom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is positioned centrally above a floral wreath but is not directly engaging or touching any single flower with its legs. The butterfly appears to be hovering symbolically, not interacting physically with any bloom beneath it. This suggests that the butterfly's position relative to the described flower does not involve direct contact.",
