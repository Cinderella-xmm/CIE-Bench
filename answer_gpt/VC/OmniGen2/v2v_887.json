      "question": "Is the golden-brown crust with visible charred edges present in the character's costume design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character’s costume does not exhibit a crust with charred edges. The costume is inspired by pizza but lacks distinct features that mimic a real pizza's crust, particularly the charred parts, focusing instead on a more cartoon-like and smooth depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible raised bubbles and browned patches on the cheese-like elements of the character’s costume?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cheese-like elements of the costume are represented as smooth and cartoonish, without the detailed textures such as raised bubbles and browned patches that are typically found on real pizza cheese.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the character’s body or head silhouette retain a triangular shape reminiscent of a pizza slice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are depicted with standard chibi-style proportions, meaning that they have a more rounded and exaggerated feature set rather than a triangular silhouette. The head and body shapes are not triangular, thus they do not resemble a pizza slice.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors of the character’s costume primarily golden-orange and yellow, matching the original pizza’s hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's costume features dominant colors that are golden-orange and yellow, which are reminiscent of the cheese and crust colors seen in real pizza imagery. These colors are consistent with the hues observed in pizza, specifically the cheese and lightly browned crust.",

      "question": "Do the cheese-like parts of the character’s costume show a textured surface with small raised bumps or ridges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cheese-like parts of the costume are illustrated in a cartoon style, depicting a flat and smooth texture without the presence of small raised bumps or ridges that would be typical of actual melted cheese.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the character designed to represent a single pizza slice rather than a whole pizza or multiple slices?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design portrays the characters with elements reminiscent of pizza, but there is no clear depiction of a single slice. The imagery does not specifically suggest that a single slice is the focal point, but rather uses pizza as an inspirational theme.",
