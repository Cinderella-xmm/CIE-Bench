      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the radish character still maintains its original shape: a white oval body with a pointed bottom, which is consistent with standard animated depictions of radish-like characters. The visual cues directly show this shape, and there is no indication of a change.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a red leash extending from the radish's right hand to the dog's red collar as seen in Image A. Instead, both characters are standing separately without any leash visible, indicating a change in setting from walking to a more relaxed snowy environment.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is presented as light brown with darker brown ears, but is wearing a green jacket rather than a red collar. This observation highlights a change from Image A where the dog sported a red collar.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
