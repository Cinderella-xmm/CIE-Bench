      "question": "Is the key-shaped symbol with swirling arms and central knob present on the leftmost book of the bottom shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookshelf appears to contain books with intricately carved details. The leftmost book on the bottom shelf does not display a key-shaped symbol with swirling arms and a central knob. The visual cue suggests otherwise, where the book cover seems plain without any visible key symbol.",

      "question": "Is the spiral motif clearly visible on the central book of the bottom shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a shelf with books having carved elements. The central book on the bottom shelf does not portray a spiral motif; the carvings are more linear and rectilinear rather than spiraling. From the visual cues, intricate designs might be present, but they do not resemble a spiral motif directly.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the flowing vine-like pattern present on the rightmost book of the bottom shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns on the books of the shelf tend to be geometric and rectilinear with carved details. The rightmost book on the bottom shelf does not illustrate a vine-like pattern; the visible carvings have different motifs instead.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a shelf structure where the top panel and vertical side frames indeed display interlacing Celtic knotwork patterns. The intricate carvings observed are classic examples of such knotwork, characterized by intertwined and looping designs commonly associated with Celtic art.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the three large books with detailed carvings positioned side by side on the bottom shelf, from left to right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents shelves with spaces between the books. On the bottom shelf, the books are not positioned side by side, suggesting varied spacing and not an evenly consecutive arrangement of three large books with detailed carvings.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the middle and upper shelves contain several books, many of which bear carved spine details. The visual assessment makes it evident that there are indeed at least four books featuring carved spines distributed across these shelves.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
