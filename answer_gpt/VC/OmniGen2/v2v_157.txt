    "Question": "Q1: Does the owl retain its brown and white spotted feather pattern?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the owl figurine appears in a simpler, more stylized form compared to Image A. The intricate details such as the brown and white spotted pattern are not discernible. Instead, the owl is depicted with solid colors typical for toy figures like Lego, without spotted patterns. This indicates that the specific feather pattern visible in Image A is not present in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the owl's large yellow eyes and black beak present?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure of the owl does not show large yellow eyes or distinct features such as a black beak. The owl seems to be simplified into basic toy-like features, which do not include the specific large yellow eyes and black beak characteristic of a real owl representation. This reduction in detail is typical for toy replicas.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the owl still wearing a graduation cap?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, it is clear that the owl itself does not have a graduation cap. The cap is on the figure next to the owl, presumably a human-like Lego figure. Therefore, the owl does not retain the graduation cap present in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the owl continue to hold the rolled-up diploma tied with a yellow ribbon?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the owl does not have a diploma or any similar object in its talons. This accessory is not evident on the owl as the figure seems to be unadorned by any such items. This contrasts with Image A where the owl distinctly holds a diploma.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there still three books stacked beneath the owl?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the owl figurine is placed within a display box alongside a human-like Lego figure. There are no books beneath the owl, which differs from the setup in Image A, where the owl is clearly positioned on top of a stack of three books.",
    "answer": "No"
