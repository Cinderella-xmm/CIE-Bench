    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the woman in the edited image positioned in a three-quarter profile view, facing to the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is positioned in an elegant pose with her body facing slightly towards the camera. A three-quarter profile view would show more of the side of the face and an angle of the body turned away from the viewer, which is not evident in this image. Therefore, based on the visual cues, she is not in a three-quarter profile view facing to the left.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the woman’s head tilted downward in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the woman's head appears to be held upright and in alignment with her body rather than tilted downward. Her posture is straight and signifies elegance, which contrasts with the notion of a downward head tilt.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the woman’s arms positioned at her sides in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's arms are not positioned at her sides; instead, they are bent at the elbow with her hands gently touching each other in front of her body. This arm positioning suggests a poised stance often seen in formal or elegant settings, confirming that her arms are not to her sides.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the woman have white nail polish on her fingernails in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals that the woman's hands are covered in gloves, which makes it impossible to discern any nail polish, let alone white polish. This fully covered hand provides a clear indication that no nail color is visible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the woman's body is oriented slightly towards the camera, her head appears to be turned towards the left. This subtle head position indicates that she is at least partially facing to the left.",
