      "question": "Is the black knit beanie present on the head of the figure in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure fits the aesthetic of a toy or collectible figurine, and while it may feature accessories typical of such design, the figure is depicted with a distinct cap that complements its explorer theme. Common sense identifies this as part of its character design rather than an accurate representation of the original attire. Therefore, it deviates from the black knit beanie seen in more realistic portrayals.",

      "question": "Is the backpack brown in color and positioned over both shoulders with visible straps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backpack of the figure aligns with the explorer theme. Observing the edited image indicates a backpack design consistent with toy or figurine aesthetics. Although implying the presence of a backpack, it does not specifically show the details as in realistic photo representation due to stylization, thus brown color and strap positioning become ambiguous.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the eyes positioned in the same relative location on the face as in the original image, with a clear gaze direction toward the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylization and conceptual design of the toy figure imply large eyes, central and simplified in design typical of figures, leading to no discernable gaze direction. The concept doesn't mirror the original photograph's realistic and directed gaze.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the figure wear a dark-colored jacket with a visible front zipper and collar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a toy-like stylization is applied, and while the outfit may resemble a jacket to suit character concept, items like zippers and detailed collars are frequently abstracted or omitted in toy design, especially for collectible figures, and the rendered aesthetic reflects this.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the pants worn by the figure blue in color and consistent with the appearance of denim jeans?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits stylized clothing commonly seen in collectible figures, such as blue pants for simplicity and aligning with character design emphasizing the toy's adventurous theme. The color can be identified, and while consistent in shade with denim, real-texture replication isn't implied due to the stylization.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the figure standing upright with one hand visible near the side of the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the figure is generally upright as part of its display design, toy figures often focus more on pose exaggeration, maintaining some arm visibility to suggest presence. Minimalism features in toy design may abstract away from intricate hand gestures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are both shoulder straps of the backpack visible and positioned over the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, though indicative of an explorer theme with implied backpack dependency, due to scale and design simplicity, details such as shoulder strap distinctiveness are not typically rendered with toy figures compared to thematically analogous photorealistic depictions.",
