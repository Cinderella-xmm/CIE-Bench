      "question": "Is the crocodile's snout with two visible teeth present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artwork of a crocodile is styled in a cartoonish, colorful way, showing a snout with visible teeth portrayed graphically. The details are exaggerated and outlined clearly as part of the artistic style. Based on this analysis, Image B does feature a crocodile's snout with visible teeth, albeit in a stylized form.",

      "question": "Is the colorful knitted hat with a red pom-pom still present on the crocodile's head in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crocodile is illustrated with a hat that appears similar to an artistic interpretation of a knitted hat. However, it is depicted in bright cartoon colors without detailed textures to define it as knitted. Despite this difference in artistic representation, the essence of a hat is retained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the crocodile with thick-framed sunglasses in bright colors, similar to orange. The colors are vivid and the lenses are not reflective but rather stylized as solid shades, consistent with the artistic representation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crocodile's head is animated looking straight ahead towards the viewer. The forward orientation is clear with no obvious leftward turn. The head positioning in this static graphic style is straightforward.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a cartoon depiction of a fully visible crocodile, which is not shown in any water or submerged context as part of its design. The bright background and solid form indicate it is not interacting with water.",
