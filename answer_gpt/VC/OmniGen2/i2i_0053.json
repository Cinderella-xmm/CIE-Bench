      "question": "Are the bananas represented with their characteristic elongated curve and yellow color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bananas are illustrated as having a smooth, continuous elongated shape that curves slightly, which is characteristic of bananas. The color is depicted in a bright yellow tone, which is typical for ripe bananas. This indicates the intent to portray them with their natural properties. The choice of illustration aims to mimic the recognizable features of bananas.",

      "question": "Is the banana holder depicted with a curved metal arm supported by a wooden base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the holder with a thin, metallic arm that arches in a curve, similar to metal due to its sheen and simplicity in line direction. The base appears to be brown and circular, suggesting wood. Though stylized, this representation aligns with a typical banana holder design where a metallic structure attaches to a wooden foundation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the bananas still rest naturally on the curved metal arm?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bananas are positioned in a manner indicating they are suspended from the top, mimicking how bananas naturally hang from the arm of a banana holder. The arrangement shows the bananas resting against the curved arm, which is consistent with a natural posture seen in real-life holders where gravity and the arc interact.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the illustration of Image B, the bananas appear to be joined where their stems meet, indicating they are part of a bunch. This depiction follows the natural occurrence of bananas being clustered together before being separated.",

      "question": "Does the wooden base of the banana holder retain its wood-like texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the base of the holder in a simple, smooth brown color, without intricate textural details that would suggest a wood grain. The style is stylized and does not capture the textured detail found in wood surfaces. Consequently, it lacks a wood-like texture.",
