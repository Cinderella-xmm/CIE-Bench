      "question": "Does the LEGO-style dog retain the golden color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO-style dog is depicted with a color that appears to closely resemble the original golden hue of a Labrador. The LEGO visual style simplifies and emphasizes certain colors, but the overall golden color is meant to simulate the original dog's coat. Based on its appearance, it retains the golden color typical of that breed.",

      "question": "Is the stop sign still octagonal in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a stop sign that visually appears consistent with a typical stop sign shape, which is octagonal. The sign's edges and angles indicate that it retains its standard octagonal design.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the stop sign retain the white \"STOP\" text?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stop sign is clearly depicted with the white 'STOP' text. This text is a defining feature of stop signs, and in the image, it remains prominent against the red background.",

      "question": "Is the LEGO-style dog still positioned sitting atop the stop sign?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement of the objects in Image B shows the LEGO-style dog placed in the same position as in Image A: sitting on top of the stop sign. The perspective and relative placement are maintained to emphasize this positioning.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background represented with gradient shading to depict the blue sky and clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses gradient shading effectively to create a background with a smooth transition of blue shades, simulating a sky. The presence of simple shapes or variations in color represent clouds, maintaining a representation of a sky in a more abstract form typical for visually simplified or stylized depictions.",
