    "Question": "Q3: Does the dark silhouette below the butterfly retain its general rugged shape?",
    "explanation": "The silhouette in Image B appears to maintain a rugged and uneven shape similar to that in Image A. This is determined by observing the undulating, irregular outline of the silhouette, which is a visual cue of ruggedness. Comparing Image B to Image A can affirm the silhouette's general tendency for rough shapes, and world knowledge indicates this is consistent with how silhouettes are often portrayed.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the butterfly still depicted as hovering above the dark silhouette?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is shown above the silhouette, as indicated by its position in the upper part of the image relative to the silhouette. World knowledge and spatial judgment indicate that the butterfly is occupying a hovering position over the silhouette by being vertically higher, consistent with perceptions of hovering or flying.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the dark silhouette below the butterfly retain its dark color contrast with the butterfly?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the silhouette as a dark contrast against the bright, blue-themed butterfly and its energy aura. This contrast is easily noticeable and maintains a visual dichotomy between the silhouette and the luminous elements above, utilizing world knowledge of color and contrast to confirm this dark-versus-light relationship remains strong.",
