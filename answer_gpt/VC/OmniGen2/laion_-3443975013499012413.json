    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the fish depicted in a continuous, coiled circular posture with its head pointing toward the upper right and tail curving beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the fish sculpture is visually represented in a distinct, coiled circular shape. Its head is clearly pointing toward the upper right side of the sculpture, while the body curves around and the tail is positioned underneath, confirming a continuous posture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there three distinct barbels extending from the lower jaw of the fish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examining the lower jaw area reveals notable detail; however, the presence of three barbels is not visually discernible or clearly defined, suggesting their absence or subtlety in design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the dorsal fin located along the upper back of the fish and shaped with a serrated edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dorsal fin along the upper back of the fish. The fin has a stylized design with alternating projections that resemble a serrated edge, reflecting creative design elements.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the scales arranged in overlapping rows along the body of the fish, running from head to tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scales are artistically designed to overlap consistently in rows along the fishâ€™s body. They span from the head towards the tail, suggesting a realistic representation of fish anatomy.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the tail of the fish curve underneath the body and connect near the head, completing a nearly full circle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the tail intelligently curving beneath the body. It visually merges or overlaps near the head, forming what appears to be a complete or nearly complete circular shape around the core of the sculpture.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there two pectoral fins visible on the side of the fish, one near the head and one further back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In reviewing the fish design in Image B, there is discernible detail of a singular fin positioned near the head. Another fin positioned further back is less apparent, suggesting the design emphasizes the forward fin prominently.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the fish carving contained within a square-shaped panel with rounded corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fish sculpture is a standalone piece and not within any panel or frame. Its presentation as a freestanding sculpture on a pedestal indicates the absence of surrounding panels or corners fitting such a description.",
