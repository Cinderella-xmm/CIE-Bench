    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the intricate iron lattice structure of the Eiffel Tower present, including its characteristic crisscross pattern and open framework?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower is depicted in a stylized miniature model within a glass dome. While the model captures the basic shape of the Eiffel Tower, it lacks the intricate iron latticework and crisscross pattern seen in the actual structure. The simplistic design omits the open framework that characterizes the real Eiffel Tower's engineering marvel. Hence, based on the visual representation provided, the intricate details are not present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the arched base of the Eiffel Tower visible, with a clear central passage beneath the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature model within the glass dome features a simplified version of the Eiffel Tower with an arched base. This model includes a clear central passage that mimics the architecture of the real Eiffel Tower's structure. The pathway beneath the arches aligns with the tower's feet and is visible, indicating the presence of a central passage beneath the structure.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the spire and crown structure at the very top of the Eiffel Tower present and clearly defined?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the Eiffel Tower as a simplified model within a glass dome. The top segment of the model includes a spire at the crown, resembling the structure's typical silhouette. However, due to the simplicity of the model, the detailed aspects of the spire and crown are not explicitly defined. Despite this, the presence of the basic spire shape is evident.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the rows of lampposts and bare-branched trees symmetrically arranged along both sides of the central path leading to the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement within the dome includes lampposts and bare-branched trees that are symmetrically placed along the sides of the path leading to the tower. This symmetrical setup mimics the alignment often seen in real-life settings for aesthetic balance, although the scale and complexity are reduced to fit within the miniature display.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there figures in the foreground positioned facing the Eiffel Tower, with some appearing to take photographs or observe it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature model within the glass dome includes small human figures, but they are simply styled and do not display specific actions like taking photographs. They are positioned facing the tower, suggesting observance but due to the scale and simplicity of design, details such as photographing actions are not distinctly illustrated.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the central pathway extend directly toward the Eiffel Tower, creating a strong linear perspective with convergence at the towerâ€™s base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The second image features a central pathway that leads up to the Eiffel Tower within the glass dome model. This path is straightforward and would naturally guide sightlines toward the tower, creating a linear perspective typical in such designs, emphasizing the path's function and the tower's centrality in the setup.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the ground fully covered in snow, with visible accumulation around the base of the tower and along the path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene within the glass dome simulates a winter setting with a snowy environment. The ground appears to be fully covered in snow, and this continues around the miniature tower's base and along the pathway, indicating snow accumulation throughout the scene.",
