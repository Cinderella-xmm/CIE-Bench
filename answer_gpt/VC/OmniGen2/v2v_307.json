      "question": "Does the bandage retain its rounded rectangular shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bandage depicted retains a rounded rectangular shape, which is a common design for bandages as it allows for comfortable wear and better fit on the skin. This shape is visually confirmed by the curves on the top and bottom edges of the bandage, matching typical bandage designs.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the central adhesive strip still present in the same relative position and size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central adhesive strip is present and is positioned in the middle of the bandage, maintaining a standard size for efficacy in covering wounds. This placement is typical for adhesive strips to ensure maximum contact with the skin. Comparing to Image A, the adhesive strip is similarly positioned and seems to retain its size relative to the bandage.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the bandage retain its visible fabric texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible texture of the bandage appears smooth and lacks the distinct fabric texture shown in Image A. Bandages often have a textured surface to provide grip and absorbency, which Image A exhibits but Image B does not, showing a smoother appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the bandage's overall proportions consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bandage appears to uphold similar proportions as in Image A, with a consistent length-to-width ratio indicative of standard bandage design. This proportional consistency is key to ensuring functional coverage, thus the overall size and shape match Image A's design.",
      "weight": 1,

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a shadow cast by the bandage, contributing to its three-dimensional appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bandage does not exhibit a shadow, which detracts from a three-dimensional appearance. Shadows are critical in depicting depth and three-dimensionality, which Image A clearly shows with its directional lighting casting shadows that enhance the bandage's dimensionality.",
