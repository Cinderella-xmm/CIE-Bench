      "question": "Is the cardinal’s body predominantly bright red with a black facial mask?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal's body is clearly visible as predominantly bright red. The facial area is accented with darker tones, typical of a black facial mask seen in cardinals, which aids in identifying this bird species accurately. Thus, based on the visual clues and common knowledge of cardinal features, the answer is confirmed.",

      "question": "Does the blue jay have a blue crest and wings with alternating blue and white bars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B explicitly shows a blue jay with a visible blue crest and wings that feature alternating blue and white bars, consistent with the recognizable markings of a blue jay. This observation is supported by common ornithological knowledge about blue jay phenotypes.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there visible snow resting on the cardinal’s head and back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal is depicted without any snow on its head and back. Both the head and back are free from any snow cover, suggesting a controlled environment like a display box where snow would not naturally accumulate. Hence, based on objective visual observation, the answer is clear.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the blue jay have a black beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B closely, the blue jay is carefully illustrated with a black beak, aligning with common descriptions of this bird species. The use of color here is consistent with common knowledge of blue jays having black beaks, aiding affirmation.",
      "weight": 2,

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the birds perched on snow-covered pine branches with visible needles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the birds are not perched on natural branches but are instead placed atop snow-covered fixtures within enclosed sections, resembling a display box. There are miniature trunks with snow on them, but no natural pine branches with visible needles, indicating an artificial setup.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Does the cardinal have an orange-red beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the cardinal with a vibrant beak distinctly colored in an orange-red hue, consistent with standard cardinal characteristics. Such a detail is typical for cardinals and provides a clear visual touchstone for observation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the cardinal and blue jay positioned in separate vertical sections of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B reveals a structured layout in which the cardinal and blue jay are set within distinct, separate vertical sections of a display box. This division is visually explicit due to the boxed framework, affording each bird its own display space.",
