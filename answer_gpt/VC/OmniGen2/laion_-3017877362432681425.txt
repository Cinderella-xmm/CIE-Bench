    "Question": "Q1: Is the three-pointed star emblem present on the front grille?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a car with a distinct logo on the front grille that is not the three-pointed star typically associated with Mercedes-Benz vehicles. The logo appears to be different, and combining common knowledge that Mercedes-Benz vehicles have the three-pointed star emblem on the front grille, it can be concluded that this logo is different. In Image A, the classic three-pointed star logo on the grille confirms this emblem for comparison.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the gullwing doors open upward from the roofline, hinged at the top?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the doors of the car are not visible in any opened or closed position, thus there are no gullwing doors visible. Image A clearly displays a car with gullwing doors open into the air with hinges at the top of the roofline. Using knowledge of automotive design, gullwing doors would normally be seen extending vertically if present, which is not seen in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Is there a vertical slit-shaped air intake on the side of the car, just behind the front wheel?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays the front of the car directly, and thus any vertical air intakes on the side behind the front wheel are not visible from this angle. Comparing this with Image A, where the slit-shaped air intake behind the front wheel is clearly visible, Image B shows no evidence of such features due to the angle.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the 'SLS' badge visible on the side of the car near the rear wheel arch?",
    "explanation": "Image B provides a frontal view of the car where side badges or markings are not visible. Image A has a side view where the 'SLS' badge is clearly seen near the rear wheel arch. Without visibility of the side area, there can be no confirmation of such a badge in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the wheels have a multi-spoke alloy design with a five-spoke pattern?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not show the wheels in a manner where their spoke pattern can be seen in detail. Image A reveals a five-spoke alloy wheel design. Comparing for similar visual cues is not possible from Image B's perspective.",

    "Question": "Q6: Are the interior seats white in color and made of leather?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, only the exterior of the car is visible and no interior features such as the seating can be seen and described.

    "Question": "Q7: Is the license plate reading 'S MC 197' with a blue German flag strip on the left?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a different style for the license plate with different characters, not matching 'S MC 197'. The logo on the front and design elements also differ from what appears on a Mercedes-Benz. Image A clearly shows a license plate 'S MC 197' with a recognizable blue German stripe on the left.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q8: Does the car maintain a low-slung, long-hooded silhouette with a short rear deck?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a car with a low-slung design, appearing sporty and aerodynamically efficient, fitting the description of having a long, aggressive hood and a compact rear deck typically seen in sports cars. This silhouette evokes qualities of low aerodynamic resistance and sporty aesthetics. Comparing this with Image A's similarly styled vehicle supports the answer.",
    "answer": "Yes"
