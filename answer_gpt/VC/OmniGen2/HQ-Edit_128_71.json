      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The statue in Image B appears colored in a greenish-blue, verdigris hue.

      "explanation": "From the visual evidence in Image B, the statue stands upright with one arm raised holding the torch while the other arm is lowered holding the tablet.
