    "Question": "Q1: Is there a large, fully bloomed white rose positioned in the bottom-right area of the image?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, which features a floral mosaic on a brick backdrop rather than an actual rose bush as in Image A, there are stylized white flowers depicted in the mosaic pattern. Although there are multiple floral designs, there is no singular large, fully bloomed white rose positioned specifically in the bottom-right area. The floral patterns are distributed evenly across the mosaic structure and don't have real roses. Based on the artistic representation and mosaic artwork, the answer is 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a pointed arch window with decorative tracery visible on the upper part of the brick building?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals a mosaic panel within the brick structure without any real architectural features such as windows. The style of the mosaic does not include a pointed arch with tracery as it is largely decorative tile work representing flowers. Therefore, based on both the visual cues from Image B and architectural understanding, there is no pointed arch window present. The answer is 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the building have a visible corner formed by two intersecting brick walls meeting at a right angle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible corner formed by intersecting brick walls since this image does not show a real building structure. Instead, Image B consists of a symmetric tile mosaic surrounded by bricks. Without the presentation of typical building features like wall intersections or corners, there cannot be a right angle corner visible as described. Based on the visual interpretation of the mosaic artwork, the answer is 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there at least three distinct rose buds visible along the stems, including one with pink tips near the center of the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, what appears are conceptual representations of flowers in a mosaic form, not any real rose buds or stems. Given the artistic nature of the tiles, there is no depiction of actual rose buds, specifically none with pink tips or multiple distinct buds. This interpretation is based on the mosaic's decorative pattern rather than physical plant characteristics. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there dark green, serrated leaves present along the stems of the rose bush?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a mosaic pattern where leaves are depicted as flat green tiles, lacking any realistic serrated texture or detail seen in actual rose bush leaves. These stylized leaves, while green, do not mimic the serrated edges typical of real plant leaves. Combining art representation with botanical understanding, the answer is 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the roses positioned in front of the brick building, creating a clear foreground-background separation?",
    "explanation": "Evaluating Image B, the flowers depicted are part of a mosaic tile artwork directly integrated into the brick wall, not positioned in front. Since the flowers are an artistic representation fixed within the same flat plane as the mosaic, there is no foreground-background separation involving three-dimensional space as expected with real flowers against a building backdrop. Thus, the answer is 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is there a tall, vertical brick structure (buttress or tower) extending upward on the left side of the building?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not contain any real architectural elements like a buttress or tower. It focuses on a mosaic design surrounded by bricks without any evidence of large, vertical structural features typically associated with towers or buttresses. Based on the flat, artistic layout of the tiles and bricks, there are no tall structures presented. Hence, the answer is 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"
