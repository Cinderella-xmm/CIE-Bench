      "question": "Is the detailed texture of the elephant's skin, showing wrinkles and creases, preserved in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual information presents a uniform gray surface that lacks any discernible texture, detail, or features. The distinct wrinkles and creases characteristic of an elephant's skin, which involves intricate patterns and a rough surface, are not evident. Therefore, based on these observations, the texture typically associated with an elephant's skin is not preserved.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the elephant's posture, including the raised front leg and curved trunk, retained in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a uniform gray surface with no identifiable features or shapes that can be associated with an elephant's posture, such as the raised front leg or curved trunk. Without any discernible elements, the posture described is not retained in this image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the elephant's ears and trunk, consistent with its young age, maintained in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is entirely gray and lacks any identifiable parts or proportions indicative of an elephant, such as ears or a trunk. Therefore, without distinct visual features related to an elephant's young age or identifiable proportions, these aspects are not maintained in the image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the elephant positioned on the rock edge, with its legs and trunk maintaining their relative placement to the rock surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entirety of Image B appears as a uniform gray surface with no evidence of any elements, like a rock edge or placements of legs and trunk. Consequently, these spatial details concerning the elephant's positioning are not present in the image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the elephant face towards the right side of the image, preserving its profile orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not showcase any identifiable elements or orientations that could suggest an elephant facing any direction, including toward the right side, due to its homogeneous gray surface. Hence, the profile orientation described is not preserved.",
