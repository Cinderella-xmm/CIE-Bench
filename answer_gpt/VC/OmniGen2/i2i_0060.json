      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is a plate of food, consisting of slices of meat and carrots, placed on a white plate. The elements of Image B do not pertain to a baby elephant or its skin texture. Hence, it is clear that the image does not include a baby elephant, and therefore does not retain any features related to elephant skin texture.",

      "question": "Is the baby elephant depicted with small ears compared to its body size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a dish on a plate, entirely unrelated to elephants or their physical features. The absence of any elephant in the edited image makes it impossible to assess features like ear size. Thus, the description of a baby elephant with small ears is not applicable to Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the baby elephant retain a short trunk in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows culinary elements - slices of meat, carrots, and garnishing on a plate. There is no elephant depicted in Image B, so attributes like the size or presence of a trunk cannot be taken into consideration for this image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject matter is entirely different, focusing on a plated dish rather than any structural elements or outdoor settings. The image includes no indications of vertical blue metal bars, which would be associated with an enclosure or zoo habitat for an elephant.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses on a culinary presentation and is devoid of any ground surface or dirt. The image highlights a plate on presumably a white backdrop, which does not match the description of reddish dirt as found in Image A.",
