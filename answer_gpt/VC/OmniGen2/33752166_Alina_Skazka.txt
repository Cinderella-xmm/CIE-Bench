    "Question": "Q1: Is the V-shaped dual-wing silhouette of the building preserved in the edited version?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the overall shape of the building appears to retain its distinctive V-shaped silhouette, characterized by two wings extending outward from a central hub. This shape is recognizable by the angular architectural design, which is preserved despite any edits to the facade details. The visual coherence of this V-shape is maintained, allowing for identification based purely on structural layout.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the floors stacked in a consistent, repeating modular pattern from bottom to top?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the building with floors that have similar balcony designs, repeating architectural elements, including the overhangs and windows. This suggests a modular pattern where levels mimic each other's layout, reflecting a recurrent structural design that typifies modular construction seen in many apartment complexes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the windows and balconies aligned horizontally on each floor?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), windows and balconies appear to be horizontally aligned relative to each floor level. The visual cues such as the straight, even lines of window frames and balcony edges indicate uniform horizontal alignment, which is common in architectural design to ensure structural integrity and aesthetic uniformity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the two wings of the building symmetrically positioned relative to the central vertical axis?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wings of the building show symmetry, with each side mirroring the other around a central vertical axis. This is deduced from the equal angled placement and similar floor pattern distribution on each side of the central structure, reflecting architectural symmetry commonly found in buildings to balance visual weight and enhance aesthetic appeal.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the yellow awnings present on the balconies in their original positions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the yellow awnings can be observed on the balconies. They seem consistent with their appearance as organized color elements interspersed between other architectural features like windows and open balcony spaces. Comparing with Image A shows that these awnings are indeed in their original positions, contributing consistent color accents across floors.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a visible separation between the window openings and the projecting balcony overhangs on each floor?",
    "explanation": "Image B exhibits clear delineation between window openings and balcony overhangs, which can be seen as separate architectural elements. This distinction helps in identifying the functional and aesthetic layout typical in modern residential buildings, where balconies project outward from the main wall line to provide space differentiation between indoor and outdoor areas.",
    "answer": "Yes"
