      "question": "Are the eyes almond-shaped with a downward gaze, maintaining their original proportion and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character appears to be a stylized or cartoonish figure, commonly seen in chibi or animated styles. Such representations often feature simplified or exaggerated facial features, rather than realistic human attributes. Given this context, it's unrealistic to ascertain real eye shape or orientation akin to a human. Instead, any depiction of eyes in Image B would likely be simplistic and stylized, often without specific anatomical features such as a downward gaze.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the nose present with a visible bridge and tip, positioned centrally between the eyes and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) features a stylized character, likely having a minimalistic and simplified design, characteristic of chibi art styles. Normally, such styles do not emphasize detailed features like a nose with a bridge and tip, especially in a highly simplified presentation. Thus, it is improbable that Image B includes a detailed, anatomically realistic nose.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the mouth have a subtle upward curve at the corners, forming a gentle smile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given the chibi or stylized nature of Image B, simplified expressions are typical, often featuring basic lines or curves instead of detailed mouth shapes. While a gentle smile might be represented, it's more likely a simplistic curve rather than a realistic portrayal of subtle expressions, as seen in realistic faces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the subject seated cross-legged with knees bent and body leaning forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted in a standing posture, consistent with its formal and structured appearance. The visual cues indicate a formal pose associated with traditional attire, so the subject is not seated or in a relaxed pose as described.",

    {

      "question": "Is there a small gold stud earring visible in the left ear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a stylized figure with intricate headwear and accessories. These accessories are more ornamental, likely with dangling elements rather than simple stud earrings. The design complexity suggests a focus on embellishments over subtlety, thus not matching a simple stud earring description.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the skin tone light to medium with natural undertones, consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a character possibly rendered in a highly stylized or animated form, where realistic skin tones might not be focal. Given that chibi or cartoonish characters typically use a limited color palette, details like subtle natural undertones aren't usually represented within their design scope. Consequently, assessing realistic skin tones becomes less relevant.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the head tilted downward with the gaze directed forward and slightly down?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a stylized figure likely in an upright and formal posture, typical of representations involving traditional outfits and ornamental attire. Typically, such depictions focus on a balanced and direct pose to highlight the attire rather than a dynamic posture like a tilted head. Thus, the described posture does not align with the character's likely presentation.",
