    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the large dark gray ribbon bow still present and positioned on the front-left side of the bag?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object visible does not resemble a bag nor does it have any ribbon bows, specifically the large dark gray one seen in Image A. Instead, Image B shows a creature-like design without any ribbon bows. Thus, the large dark gray ribbon bow is not present in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the white artificial flower still visible and centered within the large gray ribbon bow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a creature-like design and lacks any ribbon bows with a white artificial flower centered within them, as seen in Image A. The shift from a bag with decorative elements to a character design indicates the absence of the large gray ribbon bow with a white flower in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the small gray ribbon bow with a white flower still attached to the right handle by a silver chain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display a bag but instead features a non-bag form that does not have handles, a chain, or any bow embellishment. Therefore, the small gray ribbon bow and its attachment method described in Image A are not present in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the silver chain still visibly connected to the small bow and the right handle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a bag or any components of a bag, such as handles, bows, or chains. Given that Image B is a different form (resembling a creature), those elements are absent, making the connection between the chain and bow or handle non-existent.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the bag’s body still cream-colored and shaped like a woven basket with horizontal ridges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the texture of the creature-like form has a similar woven basket appearance with horizontal ridges, it does not represent a bag anymore. The bag’s shape has been replaced by a creature shape, even if the texture remains similar.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the beige satin interior lining still visible inside the top opening of the bag?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no visible top opening with an interior lining in Image B since the form depicted is not a bag but a creature-like object. Image B's design lacks any indication of interior lining, emphasizing the transformation from Image A's bag to a creature-like figure in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the background still a white brick wall with a flat white surface beneath the bag?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B remains consistent with the background of Image A, showing a white brick wall and a flat white surface. Despite the change in the primary subject of the image, the background continues to be a white brick wall with a flat white surface, indicative of the same setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the text “JourFin LoveRibbon®” still visible in the bottom-right corner of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text “JourFin LoveRibbon®” remains visible in Image B, located in the same bottom-right corner position as in Image A. The consistent presence of the branding text suggests continuity between the two images regardless of the primary subject change.",
      "weight": 1,
