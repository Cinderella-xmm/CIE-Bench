      "question": "Is the small structure with a blue roof still present at the highest point of the ridge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no alteration observed near the highest point of the ridge where the small structure with a blue roof is situated. The structure can still be seen just as it appears in Image A. The large dragon figure introduced in Image B doesn't obstruct or replace the small building. Thus, based on direct visual observation, the small structure remains unchanged and visible.",

      "question": "Are the hikers still visible along the central trail, maintaining their original positions relative to the path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trail running along the ridge can be seen with hikers visible along it, similar to Image A. The presence of the dragon doesn't appear to affect the hikers or their positions on the path. Therefore, by visually comparing the two images and noting the hikers' locations along the trail, it is evident that the hikers remain in their original positions along the central path.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the ridge maintain its original undulating shape, forming a continuous elevated backbone from foreground to background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ridge's shape in Image B continues to maintain its original undulating form, as seen in Image A. The ridgeline flows uninterrupted from the foreground to the background, suggesting that despite the addition of the dragon, the overall shape and continuity of the ridge remain unchanged.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the trees and shrubs on the slopes of the ridge still present in their original locations and densities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the trees and shrubs along the slopes appear similar in location and density as in Image A. The dragon, while prominently placed, hasn't disturbed or obscured the vegetation on the ridge. Hence, based on visual confirmation, the foliage remains consistent in its placement and density across both images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sky still uniformly overcast with soft, diffused lighting, matching the original tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B retains the same overcast appearance as seen in Image A. There are no alterations made to the sky, and the lighting remains soft and diffused, consistent with the original image. The dragon does not affect the sky's ambiance or tone.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the grassy areas on both sides of the path still green and undisturbed, retaining their original texture and color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grassy areas flanking the path are consistent with their state in Image A. Although a sizable dragon is now present atop the landscape, the grass retains its green color and appears undisturbed, maintaining its original texture and color.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the distant hills still visible in the background, fading into mist as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals the distant hills in the background, remaining visible and blending into a misty horizon, much like in Image A. The imagery of the background hills is unaffected by the dragon addition, maintaining their original visual characteristics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are the rocky outcrops at the lower edge of the ridge still visible in their original positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon occupies space near the lower part of the ridge, covering the rocky outcrops observed in Image A. Because of this obstruction, the original rocky terrain is no longer visible, replaced by the dragon's features which obscure the rocks.",
      "weight": 1,
