      "question": "Are the refrigerators depicted with a stainless steel finish and reflective surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the refrigerator has a sleek, metallic appearance that is typical of stainless steel finishes. This finish is known for its reflective surface, appearing smooth and shiny. Such a texture is common in modern kitchen appliances, indicating that the refrigerator indeed has this specific finish.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do both refrigerators retain the double-door design with water/ice dispensers located on the freezer compartments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is only one refrigerator visible instead of two. The single refrigerator shown maintains the double-door design. The water/ice dispenser is correctly located on the left door, which is typically the freezer compartment in a side-by-side refrigerator setup. However, the presence of only one refrigerator instead of two means the answer is 'No' for both retaining a double-door design, as only one is visible.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "question": "Are the refrigerators displayed in their original proportions and sizes relative to each other, without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is only one refrigerator present, unlike the two in Image A. Therefore, there is no basis for comparison of proportions or sizes relative to each other in the edited image. This indicates that the two are no longer displayed in their original proportions and sizes.",

    {

      "question": "Are the control panels and water/ice dispensers positioned correctly on the freezer doors, consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The single refrigerator shown in Image B maintains the position of the water/ice dispenser on the left door, consistent with how a freezer is typically designed in a side-by-side model. This aligns with the refrigerator in the original image (Image A) which also has the dispenser on the left. Thus, the positioning is consistent.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cabinet above the refrigerator retains its dark gray color and shaker-style design, which features simple, recessed panels typical of shaker cabinets. This design is consistent with the original image where similar cabinets are present above the refrigerators.",
