      "question": "Is the white marking on the dog's snout and muzzle clearly visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which depicts a sculpture of a dog, the white markings are indeed clearly visible on the snout and muzzle. The white color contrasts sharply against the black areas of the sculpture, which makes these markings easily distinguishable. The lighting within the display box further highlights these features, ensuring that the markings maintain their visibility.",

      "question": "Does the dog still have a predominantly black coat with clear contrast against the white markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dog sculpture in Image B exhibits a predominantly black coloration. The black areas are well-defined and contrast sharply with the white markings on the snout, muzzle, and parts of the face. This clear contrast helps to emphasize the patterns and features of the dog, making them pronounced and visually distinct.",

      "question": "Is the dog depicted in a relaxed yet alert posture in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the posture of the dog sculpture appears relaxed and static as it is designed to showcase aesthetic features rather than convey an active or alert stance. The sculpture's posture is more about a display than capturing an alert demeanor, with the dog simply sitting within the display box rather than actively engaging with its environment.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ears of the dog in the sculpture in Image B are positioned symmetrically and sit naturally atop the head, reflecting a typical anatomical placement. This natural positioning contributes to the realistic appearance of the sculpture, adhering to expected canine features.",

      "question": "Do the dog's eyes retain their reflective quality in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes on the dog sculpture in Image B do not exhibit the reflective quality typically seen in real dog eyes. As it is a sculpture, the eyes are crafted to imitate the appearance but lack the dynamic reflection and liveliness present in a real dog's eyes.",
