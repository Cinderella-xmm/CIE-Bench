    "Question": "Q1: Is the eagle’s head white?",
    "explanation": "In image B, the eagle's head is indeed depicted as white, consistent with the typical coloration seen in a bald eagle. The bright white head is distinct and clearly differentiated from the darker body and wings, which is a characteristic feature of this species. This observation aligns with known attributes of bald eagles.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the eagle have a yellow beak with a hooked tip?",
    "explanation": "In image B, the eagle is shown with a yellow beak that curves downwards at the tip, resembling the hooked shape common among birds of prey like the bald eagle. This beak shape is critical for tearing flesh, reflecting the predatory nature of eagles.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the tail feathers white and fanned out?",
    "explanation": "In image B, the eagle's tail feathers appear white and are clearly fanned out in a way that is typical for a bald eagle when adjusting its flight or landing. This fan shape allows for better control and maneuverability during flight.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the body of the eagle primarily dark brown?",
    "explanation": "In image B, the body of the eagle is displayed as dark brown, which is characteristic of the bald eagle’s plumage apart from its distinctive white head. This common coloration for the bald eagle supports the recognition of the species.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the wings fully extended upward and outward in a soaring pose?",
    "explanation": "In image B, the eagle's wings are depicted as fully extended upward and outward, which is a posture consistent with a soaring or gliding pose. This wing position minimizes energy expenditure while maximizing lift during flight.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the eagle have a visible yellow eye?",
    "explanation": "In image B, while the eagle is depicted with detailed features, the eye color is not distinctly visible due to the display method and angle. Bald eagles typically have yellow eyes, but this detail seems obscured or not clearly presented in the image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do the wings show layered feather patterns with darker tips and lighter bases?",
    "explanation": "In image B, the eagle's wings exhibit a pattern of layered feathers, with darker tips and lighter bases. This pattern is a typical representation of the aerodynamic and structural feather arrangement seen in birds like eagles, aiding in flight efficiency.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Is the overall silhouette of the eagle consistent with a bald eagle in mid-flight?",
    "explanation": "In image B, the silhouette of the eagle, with its distinct white head, yellow beak, extended wings, and dark body, is consistent with the recognizable profile and attributes of a bald eagle in mid-flight. The pose and specific features affirm this identification.",
    "answer": "Yes"
