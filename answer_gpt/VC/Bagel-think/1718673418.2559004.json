    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the elevated rocky outcrop forming the base of the island still present with its original silhouette and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the island is floating in the sky instead of being based on a rocky outcrop surrounded by water as in Image A. The base is different, with a hanging shape with vines trailing down, giving it a distinctive floating appearance. Therefore, the original silhouette and position of the rocky outcrop have been significantly altered.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the houses arranged in a dense, tiered cluster ascending the slope of the island?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the houses are indeed arranged in a dense, tiered fashion that ascends the structure of the floating island, similar to their arrangement in Image A where they are built up the slope of a rocky base.",

      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question": "Is there a visible road that connects the dock to the main cluster of houses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a dock or a road connecting any part to the main cluster of houses; instead, the entire island is floating with limited infrastructure visible, just small platforms for hovering vehicles.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no water present as the island floats amidst clouds, hence there is no wooden dock structure extending from the island into a body of water.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground consists of floating islands and clouds with large mushrooms. There are no trees visible in the foreground in the same way as in Image A where they are distinctly present.",

      "question": "Are there large mountain peaks visible in the background behind the island?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of floating elements among clouds and large mushrooms, without any mountain peaks visible as in Image A where large, distinct peaks can be seen behind the island.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting suggests that the sunlight is coming from the upper left, casting shadows down and towards the right, as evidenced by the shading on the buildings and elements in the scene.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings have maintained the red-tiled roofs and earthy tones for the walls, similar to Image A. This consistency gives a unified aesthetic to the architectural style in both versions.",
