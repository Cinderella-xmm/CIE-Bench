      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycles are red, blue, beige, and black, matching the colors of the bicycles in Image A. The colors appear consistent in both images. By retaining the distinct hues of each bicycle, it can be concluded that the original colors are preserved.",

      "question": "Are the original designs and structural details of the bicycles preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, we see that the bicycles maintain their design and structural details in terms of frame shape and components such as wheels and handlebars, compared to Image A. The edited image has not altered these aspects, ensuring the original designs and structural details are preserved.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycles have the same positioning and arrangement as seen in Image A. The order and spacing between the bicycles are identical in both images. Thus, the original arrangement and relative positions are preserved.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shadows in Image B align closely with the bicycles and correspond with the window grid lines, similar to Image A. The fall of these shadows and their alignment with the window grid remains intact, ensuring consistency.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting still emanates warmly and diffusely through the window, similarly to Image A. This lighting casts a soft hue over the objects in both images, indicating the original lighting is preserved.",
