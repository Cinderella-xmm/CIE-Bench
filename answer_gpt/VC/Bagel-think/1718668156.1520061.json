      "question": "Is the amber-colored liquid visible in the short glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the short glass contains a liquid that has an amber hue, which is visually apparent due to both the color of the liquid and the lighting conditions in the image. The amber color is distinct and can be identified by recognizing common beverages that might have such a coloration, like iced tea or certain cocktails.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is a yellow straw inserted into the short glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visibly distinct straw in the short glass with a bright yellow color, making it easily identifiable. This is a common scenario where straws are used in glasses for sipping drinks, which corroborates with real-world knowledge about beverage presentation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are ice cubes visible within the short glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows ice cubes inside the short glass, clearly visible due to both the transparency of the glass and the way the light interacts with the ice. This observation matches real-world drinking scenarios, where ice is frequently added to cold beverages.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tall glass completely filled with ice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tall glass appears to have an illuminated outline with a circuit-like design and is not shown as being fully packed with ice. The artistic representation suggests a creative edit rather than a practical depiction of being fully filled with ice.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Are the sail-like shells of the Sydney Opera House visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an artistic rendition of the Sydney Opera House, represented with blue neon-like outlines rather than the realistic depiction. The iconic sail-like shape of the Opera House is still recognizable through this artistic interpretation.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a stone ledge beneath the two glasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glasses are positioned on a surface; however, rather than a stone ledge, it appears to be a digitally altered or neon-outlined surface. Through understanding digital alterations, one can conclude that the original stone ledge is not present here.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the two glasses positioned side by side on the ledge, with the short glass on the left and the tall glass on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the two glasses alongside each other, with the short glass shown on the left and the tall glass on the right. Such positioning is common in image composition to provide balance and symmetry, and the visual cues confirm this arrangement.",
