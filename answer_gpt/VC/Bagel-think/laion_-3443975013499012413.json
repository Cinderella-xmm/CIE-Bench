      "question": "Is the fish depicted in a continuous, coiled circular posture with its head pointing toward the upper right and tail curving beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fish is seen as part of a crystal sculpture. The fish is styled in a dynamic and geometric form, appearing almost as a 3D abstract representation rather than a realistic depiction. The head of the fish is directed toward the upper left, and the overall posture does not form a continuous, coiled circle. Instead, the sculpture focuses on angular forms and the play of light. Therefore, the posture described in the question does not match the depiction in the edited image.",

      "question": "Are there three distinct barbels extending from the lower jaw of the fish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fish in Image B is represented with angular and faceted designs typical of cut glass or crystal, lacking detailed features such as distinct barbels that one might expect in a realistic depiction of a fish. The artwork focuses on modern, abstracted forms rather than biological accuracy, and there is no visual evidence of barbels extending from the fish. Hence, the fish does not have three distinct barbels in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the dorsal fin located along the upper back of the fish and shaped with a serrated edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dorsal fin is difficult to discern due to the abstract and angular nature of the sculpture. The design focuses more on geometric shapes rather than realistic features. In such a stylized depiction, the presence of a serrated edge resembling a dorsal fin is not clearly visible. Therefore, the dorsal fin in the edited image doesn't meet the description given.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the scales arranged in overlapping rows along the body of the fish, running from head to tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fish in the edited image is depicted using geometric patterns instead of naturalistic scale formations. While there are elements of the design that resemble scales, they are not arranged in naturalistic overlapping rows but rather as part of the abstract and stylized aesthetics often found in crystal or glass art. Hence, there are no traditionally arranged scales present.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the tail of the fish curve underneath the body and connect near the head, completing a nearly full circle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fish sculpture in Image B exhibits a design where the tail and body create dramatic curves but not in a manner that completes a nearly full circle from tail to head; instead, the design incorporates sharp angles and distinct segments commonly found in abstract forms. The posture doesnâ€™t exhibit the continuity required to nearly form a full circle from tail to head.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there two pectoral fins visible on the side of the fish, one near the head and one further back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the abstract and angular design of the sculpture in Image B, specific anatomical features like pectoral fins are not distinctly visible. The focus is on craftsmanship and the reflective qualities of the material, which prioritizes aesthetic forms over anatomical detail. Thus, the absence of clear fin placements means there are no two pectoral fins visible as described.",

      "question": "Is the fish carving contained within a square-shaped panel with rounded corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fish is part of a freestanding crystal sculpture placed on a pedestal. It is not contained within any panel, square-shaped or otherwise. The structure is emphasized by its geometric and angular shapes independent of any border or panel encasement. Thus, the fish is not set within a square panel as described.",
