    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the vessel positioned in the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vessel appears to be a decorative, bejeweled container rather than a simple vessel. It is positioned closer to the right side of the image rather than centered. The glowing silhouette emerging from it draws attention away from the center, emphasizing its slightly off-centered position.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a circular tray directly beneath the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a bejeweled container placed on the fabric without any visible circular tray beneath it. The container sits directly on the fabric with no separation or base supporting it.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does vapor or smoke originate from the top opening of the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a bright, luminous silhouette emerging from the container, resembling the appearance of vapor or smoke, but it is more defined and shaped like a figure. This suggests that some form of mystical or magical essence is emanating rather than simple smoke.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a container with a rounded, ornate shape rather than a conical or upward-tapering form. Its design is more like a crown or an elaborate pot covered with jewels and ornaments.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the vessel placed on a flat, patterned fabric surface that covers the visible ground plane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the container is indeed placed on a horizontally laid fabric surface that exhibits a vibrant and intricate pattern, covering the entire visible ground, indicating it serves as a decorative tablecloth.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a small opening at the top of the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vessel in Image B does not have a small, defined opening at the top. Instead, the top part is more of a decorative, jewel-encrusted design with no distinctly visible small aperture that resembles an opening.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the tray made of a material visually similar to the vessel (e.g., terracotta)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible tray underneath the container, hence, there is no comparison of material between a tray and the vessel. The container itself is richly adorned with jewels and intricate patterns, which do not resemble terracotta.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Does the fabric beneath the vessel display a structured geometric pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fabric beneath the vessel exhibits a clear and vibrant geometric pattern with repeated shapes and colors, creating a structured and symmetrical appearance typical of decorative textiles.",
