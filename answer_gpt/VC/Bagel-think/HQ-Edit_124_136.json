    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the figure seated in a cross-legged position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's legs are not crossed; instead, the figure is seated with both feet flat on the ground. This posture is evident as the figure is sitting on a bench with feet visible. Common knowledge about seating positions and the visibility of the feet on the ground indicates the absence of a cross-legged position.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the right hand positioned above the strings in a plucking gesture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right hand of the figure is indeed positioned above the strings of the instrument. This suggests a plucking gesture as is common practice when playing string instruments.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the left hand positioned on the neck of the instrument with fingers pressing the strings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left hand is on the neck of the instrument with fingers appearing to press down on the strings, which is typical when playing string instruments to alter pitch. This positioning is visually consistent with how string instruments are often played.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the figure facing forward with the head slightly tilted upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure appears to be facing directly forward, with no indication of the head being tilted, based on the alignment of the turban and shoulders.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure has a long, flowing white beard and mustache, which is clearly visible. This is consistent with traditional depictions of wise or elder characters.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the figure wearing a brown, textured turban?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is wearing a blue mosaic-style headdress, not a brown textured turban. The headdress is ornate and significantly different from a turban in style.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a visible soundboard area on the instrument?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the instrument does feature a visible soundboard area, which is consistent with string instruments to help project sound. This part is identifiable by its distinct pattern and location on the body of the instrument.",
