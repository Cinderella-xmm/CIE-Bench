      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's right hand is visible and positioned near the chest or shoulder area. This is deduced from the part of the forearm and hand resting close to the body, which matches common postures for relaxed or contemplative stance in artistic representations.",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the figure is slightly turned toward the viewer, which is evident from the visible orientation of the chest and the angle of the shoulders. However, due to the blurred nature of the face, it is difficult to determine the exact angle at which the face is turned.",
