      "question": "Is the keychain version of the character still predominantly yellow in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain character is noticeably yellow, which matches the predominant color scheme of the original Psyduck character from the Pok√©mon series.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keychain in Image B features a character with a prominent, flat, and wide bill which is primarily colored yellowish, akin to the distinguishing bill of Psyduck. Given these visual cues, it is apparent that the characteristic appearance of the bill is preserved.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain character is depicted with large, round eyes and a somewhat confused, vacant stare, alongside holding its head with both hands, which is a recognizable puzzled demeanor associated with Psyduck. This interpretation is inferred from the eyes' positioning and expression.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in the keychain version does not exhibit small triangular ears; instead, it has small appendages which are more rounded, consistent with Psyduck's design which lacks distinctively prominent or pointed ears. The visual observation aligns with the world knowledge of the character's design.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows that the character on the keychain is rounded and bulbous in shape, consistent with the body shape associated with Psyduck's typical depiction. This is indicated by the overall roundness and the plump outline of the character.",
