    "Question": "Q1: Is the cactus still spherical in overall shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus shows a spherical shape similar to a globe with symmetrical sides. This conclusion is drawn from the visual impression of a round object, common to many cacti in nature that grow in a ball-like form. Despite additional features like crystal-like elements, the fundamental spherical geometry remains intact.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the vertical ribs of the cactus clearly visible and maintaining their segmented pattern?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the vertical ribs of the cactus are prominently visible, displaying a clear segmented and ridged pattern. This pattern is typical of many types of spherical cacti, aiding in identifying key features despite the presence of extra ornamental elements like crystals.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the main body of the cactus still predominantly green in color?",
    "explanation": "Image B retains the primary green color of the cactus body, which is typical for cacti, signifying their natural chlorophyll presence. The green color is visible despite the addition of decor and embellishments, indicating that its main hue remains unchanged.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the cactus positioned vertically and resting on a flat surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus is upright, similar to its typical growth pattern in nature when contained in a pot. The cactus remains stationary and vertical within its stone-like container, suggesting a stable positioning on the surface. The visual indicators show that the cactus does not tilt or hang, confirming its vertical position.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a textured, flat surface beneath the cactus container?",
    "explanation": "Image B lacks the textured, flat surface seen in Image A. Instead, the container seems to rest on sand or an uneven surface without distinctive texture or pattern. Comparing this with Image A, which shows a wooden, lined texture, allows us to identify the difference in surface styles.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the cactus placed directly above a supporting structure (such as a pedestal or pot)?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the cactus resting in a cylindrical stone-like container, which acts as its pedestal or pot. The cactus is partially encased within this structure, maintaining the traditional placement found in potted plants and supports, confirming that it is placed directly above this supporting structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the light source coming from the upper left, casting shadows toward the lower right?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the light source is visually identified as emanating from the upper left corner, akin to the bright sun depiction. Light rays and shadows directed toward the lower right indicate consistent lighting positions typical of a natural sunlight scenario, reflecting a similar pattern found in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
