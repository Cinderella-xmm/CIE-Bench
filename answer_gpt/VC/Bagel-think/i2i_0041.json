      "question": "Do the sheep retain their interaction posture (one feeding the others) in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep from Image A have been replaced by chibi characters, which are anthropomorphic figures wearing winter clothing. These characters are standing next to each other, but there is no interaction suggesting feeding as there is in Image A where one sheep appears to be feeding the other two. The edited image alters the posture and interaction by making them look straight ahead, without any feeding activity.",

      "question": "Is the green metal railing still placed in the same relative position near the sheep in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi characters are standing next to a green metal railing, resembling the placement near the sheep in Image A. The railing appears to occupy a similar position in relation to the characters as it did in relation to the sheep, preserving the spatial arrangement where the figures are adjacent to the railing.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the snowy ground and background indicative of a winter setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a plain background without the snowy textures visible in Image A. The edited image transitions from a realistic winter setting with snow on the ground and trees to a clean, animated style devoid of elements indicating a season. Therefore, the winter-specific features like snow have been removed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a simplified cartoonish depiction with no detailed background. The wooden fences present in Image A are not visible in Image B. The edited image simplifies the background to eliminate distinguishing features such as the wooden fences.",

      "question": "Do the chibi characters in the edited image retain shapes that clearly resemble sheep?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters do not resemble sheep but instead have human-like attributes and are wearing colorful winter clothing like scarves and hats. In contrast to the sheep in Image A, these chibi characters have a stylized appearance typical of cute anthropomorphic designs. The transformation from sheep to chibi characters altered their species-specific features to a fictional style.",
