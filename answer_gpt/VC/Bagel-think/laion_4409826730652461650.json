      "question": "Is the tan and white fur pattern, including the white blaze on the face and chest patch, present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited graphic clearly maintains the tan and white fur pattern of the horse, similar to cartoon illustrations and simplified depictions often found in animations or comics. The presence of the white blaze on the face and a patch on the chest is visually clear, consistent with the artistic portrayal of fur patterns. Based on this recognition, the pattern from Image A is maintained.",

      "question": "Are the dark brown mane and tail present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a horse with clear representations of a mane and tail, both in dark brown color. These features are similar to those found in real-life animals and typical animated representations, serving as essential identifiers for a horse character. The similarity with Image A's mane and tail color is evident.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the brown fabric bridle with a wooden handle present on the horse’s head in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is illustrated with a bridle-like feature over its head, but it appears exaggerated and artistic, lacking specifics of material or handles. The wooden handle seen in Image A's detailed toy depiction is not discernible in the edited, simplified rendering.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes the depiction of wheels attached to the horse, stylizing them significantly. They are dark brown in color, similar to Image A, indicating the motif is preserved despite the transformation into a drawing.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rocking base is illustrated in a simple cartoon-style fashion with no visibility of branding or detailed texture found in a real product. The artistic rendition focuses on simplified visual elements rather than realistic product features.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the visual representation of a white blaze on the face and a white chest patch in a clear, cartoon-typical manner, similar to Image A but adapted into a simplified artistic form. This makes these features distinctly apparent.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the horse's face is stylized, the essential features of yellow eyes with black pupils and a pink mouth are present, adhering to the characteristics seen in Image A, consistent with typical horse animations or caricatures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artistic simplification removes finer details like logos or markings present in real objects. Such details typically demand realistic rendering and are usually omitted in stylized or cartoon drawings.",
