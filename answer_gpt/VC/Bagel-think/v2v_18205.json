      "question": "Is the horse depicted with a dark mane running along its neck and a long, dark tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse has a mane that is lighter in color, more like ivory than dark, and its tail is also lighter, consistent with the overall color scheme resembling a sculpture. Commonly, horses have darker manes and tails compared to their bodies, but Image B seems stylized in a way that aligns with a more uniform, sculpture-like appearance. A detailed comparison of Image A shows a typical horse color with a dark mane and tail, aligning more with real-world expectations.",

      "question": "Does the elephant have two visible, curved white tusks extending from its mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the elephant indeed has two tusks that curve downward, identifiable by their lighter color contrasting the elephant's body. In typical representations, these tusks would be white or ivory, even if the materials used are different in an artistic setting. Comparing with Image A, there are similar tusks, emphasizing the realistic aspects of elephant anatomy, but without the explicit sculptural color.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a flat wooden platform positioned between the horse and the elephant, supporting the horse and resting on the elephant’s back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the platform between the horse and elephant has no distinct wooden attributes and seems ornately designed as though it's carved from the same sculptural material as the animals. Wooden platforms generally have a distinct grain or color suggesting wood, whereas Image B presents a consistent artistic style. Image A, however, clearly visualizes a wooden platform with grain texture and color expected of wood, enhancing real-world recognition.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both the horse and the elephant depicted in profile view, facing toward the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows both the horse and elephant in profile view facing left, consistent with typical anatomical displays or artistic portrayals where animals face the same direction for balance. Image A similarly has both animals facing in the same direction, emphasizing typical composition techniques for uniformity in visual narrative.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the elephant have a long, segmented trunk that curls upward at the tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's trunk indeed appears long and curls slightly upward, although the segmented texture often observed in elephants is missing due to the smooth sculptural style. Real elephants have trunks with discernible segments or ridges used flexibly in their surroundings. Image A follows this typical segmented appearance more closely, aligning with real-life textures.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background a uniform beige color with a subtle paper-like texture and no additional scenery or objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is not uniform beige; it features statues and architectural elements around the main subjects, suggesting the setting is elaborate and likely simulating a museum or palatial environment. Background appearances usually enhance either the simplicity or complexity of the main image focus. Image A's background shows a consistent beige backdrop with textures akin to paper, removing additional visual noise and focusing on the presence of the animal artworks.",

      "question": "Is the horse’s body primarily a rich brown color with black lower legs, mane, and tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is sculpted to resemble marble or ivory, lacking the rich brown body and dark accents typical in real horses' coloration, which helps in identifying horse breeds or individual appearances by their varied colors. Image A clearly follows these typical color schemes, showcasing the rich brown with darker elements, delivering a realistic depiction known in equestrian interpretations.",
