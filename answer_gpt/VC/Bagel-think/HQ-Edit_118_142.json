      "question": "Does the transformed book retain a rectangular shape with visible binding and page structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book is transformed into a more decorative element within a diorama. Although it still has a rectangular front, it does not retain the traditional rectangular book shape with visible binding and page structure seen in Image A. The book in Image B is more of a facade or a display item without pages or regular binding visible. The conclusion stems from evaluating the visual change from a traditional book to a diorama component.",

      "question": "Does the quill retain its feathered shaft and tapered tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome reveals a quill still maintaining its characteristics such as a feathered shaft and tapered tip. Despite being placed in a diorama setting, these elements remain intact and visible, similar to the quill seen in Image A, confirming its basic structure and appearance.",

      "question": "Does the inkwell retain a container shape with visible dark liquid inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the previous inkwell seen in Image A is absent and replaced by diorama figures and a decorative setting without the presence of a traditional inkwell with dark liquid. This observation is based on the transformation from a writing setting to a sculptural arrangement, which naturally excludes the presence of an inkwell.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the book, quill, and inkwell positioned in a way that suggests they function together as writing tools?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the diorama transforms these items into purely decorative objects without functional interrelation as writing tools. The figures and encased presentation indicate a different purpose, distinct from their purely functional arrangement in Image A. World knowledge suggests that writing tools are used consecutively, but Image B's artistic display separates them from their original function.",

      "question": "Does the diorama retain a vintage aesthetic with dark wood, brass, and aged materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and B share a vintage aesthetic. Image A presents a vintage writing environment, including dark wood and brass items. Image B retains this aesthetic within the diorama through the use of similar materials and color tones, such as dark wood on the base and brass on the stand that houses the quill. These elements reflect historical styles, maintaining the vintage atmosphere.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and B exhibit ornate borders on the book’s cover. This decorative style features intricate floral designs, giving it a historical or antique appearance. This consistent element between the images reflects a stylized detail associated with vintage book designs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature an inkwell like the one supported by a tray seen in Image A. Instead, the diorama configuration is more structural, lacking the individual items associated with traditional writing setups. Thus, there is no supporting tray visible for an inkwell in Image B.",
