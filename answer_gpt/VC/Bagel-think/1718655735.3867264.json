      "question": "Does the edited image retain the angular, filigree-patterned metallic mask covering the upper face, including the prominent crest and eye-covering section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the angular, filigree-patterned metallic mask is visible, covering the upper face with a prominent crest and a design that includes an eye-covering section. This is evident from the intricate design and structure observed in the mask area. Comparing this to Image A, we notice similar characteristics in terms of design and placement, confirming that the mask is retained.",

      "question": "Are the butterfly wings retained with their original veined structure and mottled brown-orange coloration, even if rendered with a metallic or shimmering surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings exhibit a structured veined pattern and a mottled brown-orange coloration, resembling butterfly wings. Despite potential differences in surface texture, the overall layout and coloration match typical butterfly wings. Image A presents these features distinctly, and similar traits are discernible in Image B, affirming their retention.",

      "question": "Is the thin wire or cord extending from the base of the left wing still present and connected to the wing structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a thin wire or cord appears to extend from the base of the left wing, maintaining connectivity with the wing structure. This element is detectable due to its placement and the manner in which it attaches to the wing. Image A also shows this feature, and its presence in Image B affirms that it is retained.",

      "question": "Does the outfit retain the halter-neck silhouette with lace-like embroidery along the torso and arms, including the high waist and fitted form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outfit displays a halter-neck silhouette and lace-like embroidery, especially noticeable along the torso and arms, with a high waist and fitted form. These characteristics align with features classically associated with a fairy or fantasy outfit. Image A illustrates similar attributes, corroborating that these features are preserved in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the fairy depicted in a side profile pose, with her head slightly turned toward the viewer and her gaze directed forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the fairy in a forward-facing pose without a side profile, as it is held in a frontal view posture with no apparent turn of the head or redirection of the gaze. Image A also does not display a side orientation, so the pose remains unchanged, confirming a frontal depiction.",

      "question": "Are the dangling beaded earrings still visible on the subject’s ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays no noticeable dangling beaded earrings from the subject's ears, as the visibility of such ear accessories is absent. Image A might exhibit such features, but in Image B, this detail is omitted, indicating their absence.",

      "question": "Are the subject’s eyes closed and her lips painted red, matching the original appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visibility of the eyes and lips is limited due to facial obscurities, rendering it challenging to confirm their status. Given the inability to assess whether the eyes are closed or lips are painted red directly within the observable features, the answer aligns with being unable to confirm this characteristic. Image A might show the feature more clearly, but Image B’s lack of these details signifies a difference.",
