    "Question": "Q1: Is the lime green body of the saree adorned with small golden diamond-shaped butis evenly distributed across the fabric?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the statue's attire resembles a traditional saree, potentially suggesting similar adornments. However, the statue is primarily sculpted in marble with no indication of such a specific patterned fabric. Small adornments might not be visible in a sculpture and cannot be compared to fabric patterns, which require intricate craftsmanship and color contrasts to be seen, particularly in a monochrome context such as marble.",
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the pallu feature a blue and gold striped pattern with repeating elephant motifs in gold zari?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, there is no indication of a fabric or pallu with such detailed patterns. The sculpture depicts a draped appearance, yet due to its marble nature, it doesnâ€™t convey detailed textile designs like patterned fabrics. Gold zari work with its distinct metallic shine is not visible in this monochromatic statue representation.",
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the blouse royal blue with golden embroidered detailing along the neckline and sleeve edges?",
    "explanation": "The edited image features a marble statue without any distinct color or embroidery that can match a royal blue blouse description with specific detailing. Intricate embroidery relies on contrast between materials and colors, neither of which is represented in the monochrome marble medium.",
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a necklace with red and green stones positioned around the neck?",
    "explanation": "The edited image shows a statue where a necklace-like structure is present, but due to the marble medium, no colored stones are depicted, merely the sculpted suggestion of jewelry. The color and stone specifics seen in actual jewelry cannot be visually seen in a monochrome sculpture.",
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there earrings matching the necklace visible in both ears?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the statue does not exhibit visible earrings that match the necklace's description as mentioned. Typically, earrings involve small, intricate details, which might be less prominent or non-existent in marble sculptures, especially when no contrasting color feedback exists.",
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a golden bangle present on the right wrist?",
    "explanation": "The edited image shows a marble statue with an indication of a bracelet-like element around the wrist, but it cannot exhibit a golden appearance, lest the contrasting metallic shine of gold. The limitation of a single medium color prevents this."
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q7: Is there a bindi visible on the center of the forehead?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, there is no bindi present or indicated on the statue's forehead. Such a feature would rely on color or raised detail that stands out from the marble background, which is not apparent here.",
    "answer": "No"
}
