      "question": "Is the girl depicted in a posture that suggests she is interacting with the skateboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl is positioned with her feet on the skateboard and one hand on the railing, which suggests she is balancing or getting ready to interact with or ride the skateboard. The posture indicates an engagement with the skateboard rather than merely standing. Based on these observations and the typical behavior associated with someone standing on a skateboard, the conclusion is she is interacting with it.",

      "question": "Is the man depicted in a posture that suggests he is interacting with the skateboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is standing next to the girl, facing her and leaning slightly forward, with one hand on the railing. His posture is more indicative of casual interaction with others or observing, rather than interacting directly or actively with the skateboard. The position does not suggest any direct engagement with the skateboard itself.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the girl and the man positioned next to each other, leaning against the railing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the girl and the man are depicted next to each other with their hands on the railing. The alignment and positioning suggest they are leaning against it, or at least using it for support. This posture is consistent with a casual stance next to a railing.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows one skateboard under the girl's feet. The silhouette-style representation limits detail, but there are no additional visual cues of a second skateboard. From the visual information provided, only one skateboard is definitively depicted in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the outline of a tent-like structure with a triangular top, similar to Image A. The tent occupies the same background space, indicating a preservation of relative shape and placement despite the stylized transformation.",
