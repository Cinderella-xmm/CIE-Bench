    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the subject retain the original facial structure, including the shape of the eyes, nose, and lips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face is intentionally blurred, obscuring details about the eyes, nose, and lips. Without these visible features, it's impossible to assess facial structure, hence the recognition of facial features depends on visibility, which is lacking.",

    },
    {

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible braids extending from the sides of the head. The headdress obscures the hairstyle, suggesting an absence or change in hair design compared to Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the subject facing directly forward with a neutral expression, maintaining eye contact with the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face is blurred, making it impossible to determine the direction of gaze or expression. While the body suggests a forward-facing position, facial details are undeterminable.",
