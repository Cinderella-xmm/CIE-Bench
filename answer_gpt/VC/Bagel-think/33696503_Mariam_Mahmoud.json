      "question": "Is the orange circular lifebuoy still present and clearly visible in the same position near the netting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orange circular lifebuoy is clearly visible near the netting along the shoreline. Analyzing Image A shows the same object, positioned against the netting on a sand surface, common in water safety equipment to help people stay afloat. The lifebuoy remains in the same position and is easily identifiable in the edited version.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dark mesh netting still visible along the shoreline, connected by vertical poles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dark mesh netting along the shoreline is visible and connected by vertical poles. Cross-referencing with Image A where the netting serves as a barrier, the visual information indicates the netting remains a feature in Image B, serving the same function here.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the shoreline maintain its original diagonal slope from the bottom left to the top right of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals that the shoreline maintains a diagonal slope from the bottom left to the top right of the frame. When compared with Image A, this angle provides a broad view of the shoreline, which is consistent in both images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the orange lifebuoy physically connected to one of the vertical poles of the netting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orange lifebuoy appears to be physically connected to a vertical pole, as seen in the lifebuoy's proximity to the pole. In Image A, the same connection of the lifebuoy to a pole indicates a securing measure common near water edges. Both images confirm this connection.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible white foam patterns in the water immediately adjacent to the shoreline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows visible white foam patterns in the water adjacent to the shoreline, which is a common feature in water bodies where waves meet the shore, also visible in Image A. The presence of these patterns contributes to the dynamic nature of the ocean surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the sand along the shoreline still light beige in color, without significant discoloration or tinting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sand along the shoreline appears light beige in color. This is consistent with Image A, where the natural sand color is undisturbed by any significant tinting or discoloration. Sand of such color is typical in beach environments.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are at least three vertical poles visible along the netting, evenly spaced from the foreground to the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a detailed look reveals more than three vertical poles spaced evenly along the netting from foreground to background. This corresponds with Image A, where the poles support the netting in a similar fashion, suggesting a consistent design feature in both images.",
