      "question": "Is the carrot still bright orange in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot is bright orange in color, a common characteristic of healthy carrots. The bright orange hue of carrots is frequently associated with their ripeness and nutritional content, being rich in beta-carotene. The lighting in Image B highlights the vibrant orange color, ensuring it remains evident. This observation aligns with common expectations of carrot appearance based on world knowledge.",

      "question": "Does the carrot maintain its conical shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot retains its conical shape with a tapering root that broadens at the top end where the plant's foliage begins. This shape is typical for carrots, allowing efficient growth in soil and easy extraction during harvesting. Visual cues indicate the presence of this conical shape from the narrower point rooted in the substrate to the wider top.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the green leaves still present at the top of the carrot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows green leaves emerging naturally from the top of the carrot. Carrots typically have leafy greens that grow from the top end of the root vegetable. These leaves are present in Image B, evidenced by the visible stems and leaflets sprouting from the carrot despite being in a fabricated environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tapered top end of the carrot with visible roots still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a tapered top end of the carrot where the root is slightly exposed, paralleling the bottom part of harvested carrots commonly pictured. This top end has visible fibrous roots, indicating its connection to the soil, which aids in absorption and stability during growth. The tapering and root visibility are apparent as per the cues of Image B.",

      "question": "Is the carrot still positioned upright in the substrate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the carrot positioned upright in a substrate. This orientation is typical for growing carrots, as it mimics their natural growth form. The position facilitates optimal root anchoring and foliage exposure to overhead light, confirming the upright status in the visual evidence provided.",
