      "question": "Is there a tall, pointed spire rising from the center of the church roof, topped with a cross?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a noticeable tall, pointed spire rising at the center of the church roof. However, there is no cross evident at the top of the spire. This is evident from the visual cues in the edited image, where the spire's design is simplified and does not include a cross. Given the context of church architecture, a cross is a typical element, but it's absent here. Therefore, combining these visual observations with world knowledge about church structures, the conclusion can be drawn.",

      "question": "Is there a centrally located arched doorway beneath a triangular pediment on the main façade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main façade of the church features a prominent arched doorway that is positioned centrally. Above this doorway, a triangular pediment, typical of classical architectural styles, is visible. Analyzing visual cues from the image, common architectural features, and arrangement are clear, supporting the affirmation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the roof surfaces covered with red tiles, particularly on the main gable and side slopes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the roof surfaces depicted in a stylistic representation. While they reflect a warm color scheme consistent with red tiles, the exact texture and appearance typical of traditional red tiles are abstracted. Thus, in the artistic representation, they don't distinctly resemble red tiles. However, it's implied through color usage.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there multiple arched windows visible on the upper levels of the church façade, arranged symmetrically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the artistic depiction in Image B, multiple arched windows are visible on the upper levels of the church façade. These are arranged symmetrically, reflecting a deliberate and balanced architectural design common in churches and reinforced by the visual cues in the image where symmetry is a stylistic choice.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the main body of the church constructed from light-colored stone blocks or masonry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the church using a cartoonish, abstract art style that doesn’t provide detailed texture or material information. The church appears to have light-colored surfaces with a smooth illustration style, ideally representing light-colored stone or masonry. Based on typical architecture representations and the use of light tones in Image B, it seems plausible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the church façade consist of a central section flanked by two symmetrical side sections, with a spire rising from the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the design suggests a church façade with a central section flanked by two symmetrical sections. The pointed spire indeed rises prominently from the center, indicating classic central symmetry often used in churches.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the spire's very tip, there is no cross visible. Studying the final vertical element provides clarity. Despite church architecture typically including such features, this illustrative version doesn’t include it, simplifying the spire structure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The main entrance in Image B is markedly placed under the central gable, aligning well with the roof's peak. The accompanying symmetrical and ethereal elements draw attention to this centralized entrance, aligning with standard architectural practices.",
