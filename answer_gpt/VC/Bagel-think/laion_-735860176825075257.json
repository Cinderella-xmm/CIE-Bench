      "question": "Are the black-and-white half-timbered gable ends visible and positioned at the top of the central and right-side sections of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building has design elements that mimic a half-timbered style, with what appears to be white panels bordered by a color that seems to have been altered to a reddish hue in the editing process. This indication of a half-timbered design suggests that the gable ends would have been black-and-white originally based on conventional styles of such architecture. In Image A, we see the original architecture indeed featuring black-and-white half-timbered gable ends. The structure and positioning appear consistent across both images, thus confirming the presence of the architectural element despite the color change.",

      "question": "Is there a black arched door located on the left side of the building, embedded within the brick wall below the window ledge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, on the left side of the building, there is an arched door visible. While the color has been altered to a reddish tone in the edited image, the shape and position remain consistent with an embedded archway door in the middle of a brick wall. Image A confirms that this door is indeed black originally.",

      "question": "Is the sign reading \"Leeds Parkway Hotel\" present beneath the entrance awning, aligned horizontally above the main doors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the awning has been altered in color to bright red, and no legible text is visible on it due to the editing style. In Image A, a sign reading 'Leeds Parkway Hotel' is clearly present under the awning. Since the edited version lacks any discernible text on the awning, it means it is not visible in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there rectangular planters with colorful flowers positioned along the base of the building, both in front of the black arched door and near the entrance steps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the presence of planters, albeit with a stylized color and shape, placed in locations similar to the open spaces visible along the building base, indicating an attempt to represent flowers and planters. Image A confirms these are rectangular with colorful flowers. Despite the altered artistic representation, this suggests an intent to depict similar arrangements in the edited image.",

      "question": "Are there multiple windows with white frames arranged in grid patterns, including dormer windows on the roof and a bay window on the right side of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the windows appear stylized with contrasting colors. The window shapes and locations do match those grid-patterned and bay windows characteristics in such architectural styles. Image A shows that there are indeed white-framed grid-patterned windows and dormer windows on the roof, confirming the building's design features have been preserved in Image B despite the color alterations.",

      "question": "Are the main entrance doors located centrally under the awning, consisting of two wooden doors with glass panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the position of the entrance under the central awning is consistent with the design. However, due to the artistic modifications, the details of the doors are indistinct, and identifying them as wooden with glass panels is not feasible. In Image A, the doors are clearly visible as wooden with glass panels, but such details are not discernible in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the colors have been altered, it's evident there is an attempt to portray a brick structure through the visual texture applied. The placement suggests an echo of the original structure seen in Image A, where the building is indeed made from red brick with an arched black door embedded. The lower section being a brick structure with an arch, albeit altered in color, correlates with the original depicted aspects.",
