        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the croissants are depicted with a golden-brown color and an appearance that suggests a flaky texture, typical of croissants.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cupcake frosting prominently features a swirl pattern similar to decorative icing techniques used in baking.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a cupcake with blue frosting, which matches one of the original frosting colors (blue) from the first image. However, the frosting colors pink and yellow are not evident, as the remaining frosting is red, diverging from the initial color scheme.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of tartlets with berries as seen in Image A. Thus, there is a departure from retaining the detailed arrangement and coloring of red and blue berries within tartlets in the edited image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a rearranged layout of pastries. Unlike in Image A, where specific desserts are grouped and positioned distinctly, Image B disperses elements like a map or illustration, without retaining the relative positions or groupings as seen in the original.",
