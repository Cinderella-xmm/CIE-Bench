        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is dressed in the same blue garment that is recognizable from the original.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure is positioned on what visually resembles the edge of a bridge or platform.
