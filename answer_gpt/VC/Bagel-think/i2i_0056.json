        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the foreground features a chibi character instead of a horse, so the horse's coat and mane are not visible. Therefore, the image does not retain any specific features of the horse, including the brown coat and dark mane.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image replaces the horse with a chibi character wearing a construction outfit. This character stands upright, thus the image does not depict any grazing posture reminiscent of a horse.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, a small structure that resembles a white house is present in the background, similar to the buildings seen in the original image. Thus, the white house remains visible in the edited version.",
