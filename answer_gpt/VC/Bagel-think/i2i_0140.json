      "question": "Does the quilt pattern retain its distinct pink, green, and white geometric and floral motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quilt pattern appears to be altered with more watercolor-style vibrant colors. While there are still visible geometric shapes and floral motifs, they do not distinctly retain the original pink, green, and white color scheme seen in traditional quilts. The colors look more abstract and artistic with a wider spectrum, suggesting that the original specific color motifs are not retained.",

      "question": "Are the two beds still placed parallel, with the nightstand positioned centrally between them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beds are clearly still placed parallel to each other as observed from their alignment. The nightstand remains positioned centrally between the two beds, holding a similar role in the layout as seen in conventional bedroom setups.",

      "question": "Do the two framed wall art pieces remain above the respective beds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the watercolor effect applied to the image, it is apparent that there are framed items above each bed at approximately the same positions as a standard decor setup. This indicates that the framed wall art remains above the respective beds.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the decorative pillows have been altered to match the artistic style of the image. The left pillow appears to have more pinkish hues similar to magenta, whereas the right pillow is more of a bluish shade, closely resembling teal. Although artistic, the general color scheme of magenta on the left and teal on the right is still maintained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the position and presence of a nightstand between the two beds. The nightstand is still white, and the vase with what appears to be pink flowers is also visually consistent with the artistic edits, reinforcing the presence of these items in their respective positions.",
