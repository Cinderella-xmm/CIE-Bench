    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the alternating pattern of light and dark squares on the chessboard preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chessboard shows a pattern of alternating light and dark squares, which is characteristic of a standard chessboard. This pattern helps in defining the layout and is consistent with traditional chessboard design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the king located in the central position of the visible row of black pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central position among the visible royal chess pieces such as the king or queen can be identified by the size and shape. The central piece does not resemble a king due to its lack of a crown; rather, it can be mistaken for a queen based on its attributes.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there exactly two bishops, two knights, and at least four pawns visible in their original positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, positions and number of characteristically shaped pieces were checked. However, only one bishop visible conflict with two required, thus not matching the setup typically associated with standard chess positions.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the shadows of the chess pieces extend diagonally toward the bottom-left of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows of the chess pieces are directionally analyzed by seeing where they fall relative to each piece. They appear to be extending toward the bottom left, which is indicative of the lighting direction.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wood grain texture of the chessboard surface visible across the light squares?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the contrast and details show a clear wood grain pattern visible on the light squares, which adds texture and depth to the chessboard.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a blurred background with horizontal structural lines visible behind the chessboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is noticeably blurred and includes some horizontal lines that indicate structural elements behind the chessboard, giving context and depth to the scene.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there exactly eight black chess pieces visible in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, different chess pieces were observed and tallied. While the pieces are not traditional black, their positions fill a similar row, but only seven pieces can be counted.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the background of the image blurred while the foreground pieces are in sharp focus?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus technique employed clearly delineates the sharp detail of the foreground chess pieces against a blurred background, illustrating depth-of-field effects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
