      "question": "Is there a visible gular pouch located beneath the lower mandible of the beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image depicts a cartoonish bird where the gular pouch is represented by a smooth area beneath the beak. The design does not emphasize the details of a gular pouch, which is normally found in pelicans as part of their anatomy. Hence, the pouch is not visible in the edited image. The absence of anatomical details typical of a pelican's pouch contributes to the conclusion of no visible gular pouch.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the feet clearly webbed with visible claws at the tips of each toe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows cartoonish bird feet drawn as simplified orange shapes without webbing or claw details. The feet lack the anatomical details such as webbing and claws that are seen in real pelicans. World knowledge about pelican anatomy, which typically includes webbed feet with claws, indicates the absence of these features in the edited version.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the feathers on the body composed of layered, striated structures with visible individual feather shafts and overlapping edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The feathers in Image B are depicted as simplified and uniform patterns rather than detailed structures seen in actual birds. Unlike natural feathers that have overlapping edges and visible shafts, the cartoon style depicted uses repetitive and abstracted forms without detailed striations. The lack of complexity leads to the conclusion of 'No'.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bird have a long neck curving down from the head to a broad, rounded body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon bird does have a long neck that is streamlined and curving from the head down to the body, imitating a posture typical of pelicans. The stylized representation maintains the essence of the bird's long neck attached to a rounded body. Hence, the details on the neck and body match world knowledge of pelican anatomy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are both legs positioned under the body, supporting the pelican in a grounded standing pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts the bird in a stylized manner where legs are not clearly shown under the body in a typical standing pose; the legs are abstract and not anatomically correct. Pelicans generally have their legs visibly positioned to support them standing, but Image B does not showcase this detail clearly. Therefore, comparison with Image A would show a contrast, confirming 'No'.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a single dark, round eye visible on the side of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon bird features an exaggerated stylistic large eye, which is round and prominently visible on the side of the head. Although it follows a typical cartoonish convention and not real-life pelican features, it matches the description provided due to its visibility and position.",

      "question": "Is there a small tuft of feathers raised at the crown of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not show any tuft of feathers at the crown; instead, the bird is depicted with a blue hat-like accessory. Image A shows the natural tuft, comparing this from the real image reveals an alteration where the tuft is replaced, leading to 'No'.",
