      "question": "Is the river present beneath the bridge, flowing from the background toward the foreground with visible white water over mossy rocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a river visible beneath the bridge, flowing from the background towards the foreground. The river displays white water indicative of flowing over obstacles, which are specifically mossy rocks, common in natural streams. This observation is drawn from the visual elements of the rushing water and the textural appearance of the rocks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there moss-covered rocks visible in the river, especially near the center and right side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, moss-covered rocks are indeed visible in the river. These rocks are prominently positioned near the center and along the right side of the image. The characteristic greenish texture on top of the rocks indicates moss, which commonly covers rocks in moist environments like rivers.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are multiple fallen logs visible along the left and right riverbanks, some partially submerged in the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several fallen logs are observable along both sides of the riverbank. These logs are scattered along the edges of the river and some extend into the water, partially submerged. This is evident from the orientation and partial submersion of the logs as seen in the image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a canopy of green leaves overhead, allowing dappled sunlight to filter down onto the bridge and river?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a scene where a canopy of green leaves is clearly visible above. The effects of dappled sunlight are observable as it streams through the foliage, casting patches of light onto both the bridge and river, suggesting an intricate play of light consistent with a thick canopy overhead.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there several large, moss-covered tree trunks leaning toward the bridge from the left bank, with one prominently curving over the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are multiple large tree trunks leaning toward the bridge from the left bank. One prominently curves over the structure, covered in moss which gives them a greenish texture that further accentuates their presence. This observation aligns with typical forest imagery where trees grow toward light or are shaped by environmental factors.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the image captured from a low-angle viewpoint, looking upward at the bridge from near the river level?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perspective indicates a low-angle viewpoint, with the line of sight directed upward towards the bridge. This is evident from the elevated presentation of the bridge structure and the river level being close to the image's foreground, which are indicators of a low-angle capture.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the bridge structure extend horizontally across the river, supported by towers on both sides, forming a continuous span?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bridge indeed extends horizontally across the river. It is supported by towers on both ends, maintaining a continuous span over the river. This description holds true given the appearance of the bridgeâ€™s structural design and its connection between two distinct points.",
