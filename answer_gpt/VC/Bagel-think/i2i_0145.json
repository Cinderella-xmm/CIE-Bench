      "question": "Is the horse depicted with its original white coat and blonde mane and tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The horse in Image B appears with a white coat along with a flowing blonde mane and tail. Upon observing Image A, the horse also has a white coat and blonde mane and tail, which is unchanged in Image B. World knowledge suggests a horse's coat and mane/tail color are distinctive features and can be easily identified through color consistency.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the horse retain its posture of being in mid-gait?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is depicted in a dynamic posture indicative of mid-gait while running, with its front legs raised and body angled as though in motion. Upon comparison with Image A, the horse also exhibits a similar posture. General understanding of horse movements confirms this as part of their running gait sequence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the horse's original hooves visible and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the hooves of the horse can be clearly seen, showing a realistic appearance. When analyzed alongside Image A, there is no visible change or alteration in the hooves. Hooves are important features in horse anatomy and typically remain consistent unless intentionally altered.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the horse's body proportion consistent with its original form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse maintains a proportional body consistent with its form in Image A. The musculature, leg length, and overall body size appear natural and unchanged. Understanding of horse anatomy, which usually consists of strong, muscular forms, supports the conclusion that there are no proportional changes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the horse's eyes and facial expression unaltered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the horse with seemingly unaltered eyes and facial expressions that are similar to those in Image A. The expression shows alertness, which aligns with horse expressions in both images. Knowledge of animal expressions, particularly in horses, which are characterized by alert and calming demeanors, suggests no alteration in facial features.",
