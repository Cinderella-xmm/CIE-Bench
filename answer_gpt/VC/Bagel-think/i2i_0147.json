      "question": "Are the ketchup and mustard still visibly drizzled on the hot dogs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hot dogs are topped with slices of cheese and crispy bacon bits rather than ketchup and mustard. The drizzle of condiments is not visible due to the addition of these new toppings. Therefore, based on the visual evidence, the answer is no, the ketchup and mustard are not visible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buns appear as a light golden color with a slightly toasted appearance. This resembles the appearance of the buns in Image A, indicating that there is no significant difference in their toasted texture or color.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B still shows the hot dogs being cooked on the grill, with visible black grill bars and bright orange flames underneath, just as in Image A. The visual elements remain consistent in terms of the grill and the flames.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hot dogs remain properly situated inside their buns, similar to their positioning in Image A. The addition of cheese and bacon does not alter their alignment within the buns.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B continues to have a dark background, which sets off the brightness of the flam and the colors of the hot dogs and their toppings, similar to Image A. This consistent use of contrast helps to highlight the food as the central subject of the image.",
