        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla carving is shown sitting with its left hand positioned under its chin. This pose represents a thoughtful gesture and is common iconography used in such sculptures.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden carving in Image B uses stylized lines and contours to depict features commonly associated with gorillas, such as a strong jawline and wide nose. However, these are simplified due to the carving's nature, yet they show enough resemblance to suggest the features are intended to match a silverback gorilla.",
