      "question": "Is the fallen log still present in the foreground, lying diagonally across the cave floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual area corresponding to the cave floor in the foreground still shows a dark object lying diagonally across it, similar to what can be observed in Image A. Given that the log is a prominent feature that is likely unchanged, it can be deduced that the log remains present. The world knowledge about similar rocky environments suggests that such objects, like fallen logs, often do not change much between photos unless intentionally removed.",

      "question": "Does sunlight still enter from the arch opening and illuminate the right side of the cave interior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a distinct light source entering from the arch opening, clearly highlighting parts of the interior. This suggests sunlight is entering, much like in Image A where the sunlight naturally illuminates the cave. The knowledge of natural lighting helps conclude that sunlight still affects this area.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the rocky, uneven ground surface visible beneath the arch and extending toward the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visual inspection of Image B shows a continuation of the uneven rocky surface which is a prominent feature in Image A. This rocky surface is a likely characteristic of a cave environment, and unless there are specific edits that alter this extensively, it is reasonable to assume it remains visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bright sky and distant tree-covered hillside still visible through the arch opening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arch opening still includes a bright area suggesting presence of the sky. However, the modifications seem to include additional elements that obscure parts of the view. From the remaining visible section, the details fail to confirm the visibility of specific elements like the tree-covered hillside as observed in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the cave interior structured with converging rock walls and a clear path leading toward the arch opening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite significant artistic modifications added to the scene, the foundational cave structure remains clear. The innate structure of the cave interior with its converging rock walls and pathway remains distinctive and continues to guide visual attention toward the arch, a common trait in cave photographs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the surrounding rock walls still composed of layered sedimentary rock with natural weathering patterns and beige-to-brown coloration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the natural appearance of the rock walls, with their layered and weathered structure. The coloration, although possibly altered slightly due to editing effects, continues to exhibit the natural beige-to-brown palette typical of sedimentary rock. Therefore, significant changes to these characteristics do not appear to have been made.",
