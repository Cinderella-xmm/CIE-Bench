    "Question": "Q3: Is the acacia tree present with a broad, flat canopy and extended horizontal branches above the elephant?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a smaller-scaled tree in the box, but it does not resemble a traditional acacia tree with a broad, flat canopy and extended branches.

    "Question": "Q8: Is the lighting consistent with a source from the upper left, casting shadows on the right side of the elephant and grass?",
    "explanation": "Image B reveals lighting typical of an indoor setup with shadows and reflections that do not originate from the upper left as would be consistent with natural sunlight casting distinct directional shadows seen in outdoor scenes like Image A. Instead, shadows and reflections are dispersed throughout the enclosed box area.",
