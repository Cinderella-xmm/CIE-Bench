      "question": "Is there a visible red flower-like motif present in the central area of the transformed object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central area of the transformed object is dominated by glowing elements resembling gemstones and feathers, rather than red flower-like motifs. The colors and patterns displayed do not correspond to a flower-like appearance but instead appear as decorative features resembling a phoenix egg. Thus, this area lacks any distinct flower-like design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a continuous blue geometric pattern forming a border near the upper edge of the transformed object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible continuous blue geometric pattern forming a border near the upper edge. The focus of the design is on a phoenix egg, with vibrant glowing colors and complex structures, none showcasing a blue geometric border pattern. The geometric patterns are strongly associated with traditional motifs, absent in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there green leaf-like shapes integrated into the surface design of the transformed object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface design of the transformed object in Image B includes fiery elements and gemstone-like structures without the presence of green leaf-like shapes. The design appears to depict a mythical object (phoenix egg) with decorative features like gems, making any leaf-like inclusion unlikely.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the patterns outlined in black to define individual elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The patterns on the transformed object in Image B are developed through glowing colors and elaborate design elements but are not outlined in black. The object exhibits intricate designs such as feathers, jewels, and flames without using black outlines to define these features.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the pattern arrangement radially symmetric around the center of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design concentrates on mythical and fantasy elements like a phoenix egg. While there's symmetry around the center with the gemstone placements and feather arrangements, such symmetry is intentional for aesthetic purposes and not for pattern arrangement as is typical for traditional designs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors blue, red, green, and black used throughout the design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dominant colors are more red, orange, and golden hues representing a fiery phoenix-related theme with glowing gemstones, removing the use of traditional dominant colors like blue, green, and black associated with the original design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the transformed cup (now phoenix egg) positioned within or upon the transformed saucer (now nest)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the phoenix egg clearly situated atop the transformed saucer (now styled as a nest). This is evident as the egg is seen resting centrally upon the round plate, which is consistent with design choices coupling mythical themes with nested imagery.",
