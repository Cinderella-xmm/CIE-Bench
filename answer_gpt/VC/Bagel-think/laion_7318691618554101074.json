      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there exactly eight upright objects arranged in a tight vertical cluster within the container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, I observe the container holds upright objects that resemble decorative swizzle sticks or stirrers, topped with jewel-like ends. By counting the visible upper parts of these sticks, I see there are six distinct items. These objects are closely arranged, forming a tight cluster. Since there are only six sticks, the answer is clear based on visual evidence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a bed of small, uniformly shaped spherical objects filling the lower portion of the container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B shows that the container is primarily filled with glass and doesn't contain any additional filler in the lower portion, such as spherical objects like beads or pearls. The design of the cut glass itself gives a textured appearance, but this isn't indicative of additional contents. Therefore, the container lacks a bed of small, spherical objects.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a decorative band located precisely at the upper rim of the container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the container lacks any sort of band, ribbon, or lace attached near its upper rim. The surface is clear with no added adornments, offering an uninterrupted view of the contents. This absence of a decorative band at the rim contrasts with any assumptions a band might typically entail.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the container transparent, allowing full visibility of the contents inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The container in Image B is made of clear, possibly cut glass, which, despite its decorative etchings, allows visibility to see what's inside. This transparency ensures that the objects contained within can be clearly observed, even though the glass's design adds decorative elements.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all the objects positioned vertically, with their tips pointing upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, all the sticks with decorative jewel ends are protruding upwards out of the container. Their vertical arrangement ensures each decorative tip faces upward, which suggests they are likely intended for display purposes. This vertical, upward orientation is a striking feature of the arrangement.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there at least three distinct sizes of objects visible in the cluster (large, medium, small)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects in the container appear to have similar sizes, particularly the stems. However, the jewel-like ends differ, with some being larger and others smaller. Despite this variance in the top adornments, the differentiation isn't clear enough to classify distinct sizes across a range of large, medium, and small objects.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the container resting on a flat, horizontal surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the container is placed on a visible flat tabletop or counter. This surface is smooth and level, providing a stable base for the container. The reflection of the container on this surface further affirms its horizontal and flat nature.",
