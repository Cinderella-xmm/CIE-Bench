      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the region where the face would be is obscured, indicating alterations. Since the question specifies analysis of her facial features which are not visible in the image, common sense dictates that the answer is influenced by the alteration.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glasses appear as part of an illustration rather than an object in a photo, with some difficulty in distinguishing the tinted lens due to the blurring. However, the shape and presence of glasses align with the original design.",
