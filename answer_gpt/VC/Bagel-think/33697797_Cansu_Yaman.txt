    "Question": "Q1: Is the gray stone-paved floor present in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the floor appears to be stylized and does not clearly resemble a typical gray stone-paved surface as seen in real-world settings.

    "Question": "Q2: Are the metal support beams and window grid patterns visible in the greenhouse structure?",
    "explanation": "Image B diverges from the structural and architectural cues of a typical greenhouse. The fantastical elements like glowing spheres and dense plant foliage obscure any view that could include metal support beams or window grid patterns. Thus, such structural features are not distinctly visible in the edited image.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are visible wheels attached to the base of the shelving units?",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the large plant with broad green leaves positioned in the foreground on the right side of the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible structure resembling a plant with broad leaves on the right side, but given the heavily stylized nature of the image, it doesn't match the realistic depiction seen in Image A. Despite these changes, the overall placement suggests that a plant is still prominent in this position.",
