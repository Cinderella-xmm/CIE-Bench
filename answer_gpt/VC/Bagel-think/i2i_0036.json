        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's fur shows a combination of black and brown hues, notably around the lower part of the face and neck area. This indicates that the fur is not entirely black. This conclusion is drawn from observing the color variations in the cat's fur in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible tie around the cat's neck. The cat appears to have glasses and a notebook, suggesting a different thematic style compared to a formal tie. Based on this visual cue, it can be concluded that the tie is not present in Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's eyes are shown as bright yellow, visible behind the glasses it is wearing. This indicates that the color of the eyes remains unchanged, supporting the conclusion from the visual cue in Image B.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and B show the cat on a carpet, which appears to be beige. This is determined by observing the light brown color of the carpet in Image B, which matches common knowledge of beige color tones.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible structure that looks like a bookshelf in the background. This is determined by noting the arrangement of what appears to be books and DVDs on shelves, which aligns with what would typically be expected in a bookshelf setting.",
