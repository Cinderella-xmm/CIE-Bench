    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the skater captured mid-air while performing the trick?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater is shown at a significant height above the ground, which indicates he is mid-air. His posture and the position of the skateboard suggest he is performing a jump or trick. This aligns with common skateboarding tricks where skaters leap off the ground while manipulating the board.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the skater's hat still feature the geometric pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater's hat appears to have the same design as in Image A: a geometric pattern. This can be inferred from the distinct shapes and lines visible on the hat in both images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the skateboard positioned below the skater in mid-flip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard is visible below the skater and is not parallel to the ground, indicating a mid-flip movement. This suggests the skater is executing a trick where the board rotates or flips under his feet.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the building facades and tree branches visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows tree branches and building facades behind the skater. Despite any stylistic changes, these elements remain discernible in the background, giving context to the urban environment of the scene.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a clear blue sky above the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area above the scene exhibits a clear blue color, indicating a clear sky. Blue skies are commonly seen in outdoor photography, especially in clear weather.",
