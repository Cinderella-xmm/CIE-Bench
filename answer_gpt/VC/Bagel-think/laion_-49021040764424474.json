      "question": "Is the \"Wildtrak\" badge visible on the lower side fender of the vehicle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vehicle is constructed from LEGO bricks and its design mimics a real pickup truck with basic elements. A badge or emblem like 'Wildtrak' requires detailed printing or shaping, which is not typically present in standard LEGO builds. Therefore, there is no visible 'Wildtrak' badge in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the tailgate fully lowered, exposing the truck bed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO truck features a tailgate made of bricks that is in a horizontal position, indicating it is fully lowered. This fully exposes the truck bed in the same way a real vehicle's tailgate would.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a LEGO truck with what appears to be two sets of doors modeled on it. The LEGO representation of the truck includes clear separations indicating front and rear doors on the passenger side.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rear taillights of the LEGO truck are represented by red bricks. Due to the simplified nature of LEGO models, the colors do not indicate different sections such as clear or red parts.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO model does not show a typical roof rack but may include LEGO elements suggesting additional detail. However, it does not resemble a real roof rack found on full-sized vehicles due to the constraints of the medium.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the windows and bed surround of the LEGO truck are designed using black LEGO pieces, indicating black trim along these areas as a stylistic choice consistent with actual vehicle designs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO truck's rear wheels are embedded within an arch surrounded by a different colored set of bricks, signifying a wheel arch just like in a real vehicle.",
