      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration is a street art-style depiction and the face area is blurred out, preventing any detailed comparison of face shape or facial features like glasses. The artistic style typically exaggerates or completely alters realistic features for stylization. Since the face is not clearly visible, we can't determine if it maintains the original face shape or glasses.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the man's tie features a detailed, possibly narrative pattern, which is an important visual feature. In Image B, the illustration depicts an abstract character that doesn’t distinctly show a tie. The focus is on a dynamic pose rather than detailed clothing patterns. Given the illustration’s style, it does not include the specific pattern of the tie.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A shows a suit jacket with a subtle checkered pattern. However, Image B's illustration emphasizes bold outlines and dynamic action typical of graffiti. There are no specific details indicating a checkered pattern on the clothing of the illustrated figure, focusing more on shape and movement rather than fabric patterns.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A shows the man wearing a striped dress shirt beneath his suit. In Image B, the illustration style is very abstract, focusing on bold lines and colorful backgrounds typical of graffiti art, without specific details like a striped dress shirt being maintained. The illustration does not include such fine details of clothing.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A shows the man with a short-cropped hairstyle. In the illustration of Image B, the artistic style commonly simplifies or completely changes personal features such as hairstyles for stylization. There’s no depiction of any hairstyle due to the abstract nature and lack of facial details in the illustration.",
