    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the fountain located at the exact center of the garden layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fountain is depicted as a focal point of the garden's geometric layout. The hedges and walkways all seem to converge towards the fountain's position, indicating it is meant to be perceived as central. Such centralized arrangements are common in formal gardens to create symmetry and balance.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the hedges and flowerbeds form a symmetrical radial pattern centered on the fountain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the garden design features hedges and flowerbeds that are arranged in a symmetrical fashion around the fountain. The layout appears radial, with pathways and greenery extending outwards from the central fountain, which is a common feature in gardens designed for visual harmony.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there an arched gateway at the far end of the central path, aligned with the fountain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a central path extends from the fountain towards the distant section of the garden, but it leads to a pair of colorful illuminated pillars instead of an arched gateway. This indicates a deviation from typical garden entrances.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there traditional houses with thatched roofs and chimneys visible beyond the garden wall in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the introduction of fantasy elements in Image B, the background still shows traditional houses with thatched roofs and chimneys. These elements reinforce a classic countryside setting, which remains consistent with traditional garden views.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there pink roses clustered in the immediate foreground, closest to the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the immediate foreground displays pink flowers, suggesting they are roses similar to those found in the original layout. Their position as the closest flowers to the viewer suggests they maintain the visual prominence and beauty they had initially.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there purple lavender plants arranged in a ring around the base of the fountain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there are plants around the fountain, the arrangement around the base doesn't clearly present a defined ring of purple lavender as in the original. Changes in color and arrangement of elements around the fountain suggest a different layout.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there two tall, cone-shaped topiary trees flanking the entrance to the garden?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the presence of modified vertical elements resembling topiary tree shapes flanking the path remains but they have taken on a more fantastical form. Despite this transformation, these elements continue to flank the pathway.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is there a visible horizon line separating the sky from the distant landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background portrays a landscape where the sky clearly meets the distant ground features, creating a visible horizon line. The presence of such a line helps in establishing spatial depth and continuity between the garden and the surrounding area.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Are pink roses, purple lavender, and red tulips all present in the garden in their original positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the garden contains a variety of colorful flora, the positions of the pink roses, purple lavender, and red tulips appear altered from the original. The arrangement does not conform exactly to the initial layout observed in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
