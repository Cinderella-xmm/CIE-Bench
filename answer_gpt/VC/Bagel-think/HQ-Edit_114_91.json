      "question": "Is the anvil’s pointed horn still present and positioned at the same end of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the anvil retains its original shape, including the pointed horn, which remains at the end of the object. This is verified by visual identification of the anvil's typical form, where the horn is designed for shaping metal. The positioning in Image B aligns with the traditional design and orientation, similar to the original observed in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the hammer retain a wooden handle connected to its head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer is depicted with a wooden handle attached to its metal head. Analyzing the image shows clear continuity of the handle from the base to the head of the hammer, indicating retention of the handle material and structure. A comparison with Image A confirms consistency in the hammer's design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hammer resting diagonally across the anvil’s flat surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B reveals that the hammer is positioned diagonally across the flat surface of the anvil. This diagonal orientation indicates the resting stance, commonly employed for convenience during metalworking ensconced in a traditional workshop setup. Image A shows a similar orientation, confirming the positioning remains unchanged.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a multi-paned window with frosted glass visible on the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a window composed of several panes with a frosted glass appearance is visible on the left side. This type of window is characterized by its diffused light transmittance, common in workshop settings to ensure privacy while maintaining ambient light. Image A also shows the same window configuration, confirming it remains intact.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are multiple metal tools mounted vertically on the greenish-gray wooden wall behind the anvil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a series of metal tools mounted vertically on the wall behind the anvil. The arrangement and alignment of these tools are indicative of typical tool organization in a workshop for easy access. A comparison with Image A shows the same positioning of tools, demonstrating no change in arrangement.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are green ivy leaves visible growing over the window frame and wrapping around the base of the anvil and hammer handle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly exhibits green ivy plants creeping over the window frame and encircling parts of both the anvil and hammer handle. This plant growth signifies a natural, untamed environment often associated with abandoned or seldom-used workshops. These features are consistent with those seen in Image A, confirming the presence of ivy.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the anvil sitting on a wooden workbench showing signs of wear and dust accumulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the anvil is positioned on a wooden workbench that exhibits characteristics of wear, including dust and worn surfaces, reflecting a realistic depiction of a workshop environment subjected to continuous use over time. Comparison with Image A further supports this condition via shared visual traits of aging and maintenance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there visible roots and organic debris scattered on the surface of the workbench?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "An analysis of Image B demonstrates the presence of roots and organic debris distributed across the workbench surface. This scattered arrangement adds to the portrayal of natural growth overtaking a human-made environment, consistent with findings from Image A, suggesting persistent natural intrusion.",
