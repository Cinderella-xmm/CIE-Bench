        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beige sofa shows three cushions arranged similarly to Image A.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the wood-paneled section of the wall is visible next to the potted plant, just as it is in Image A. The paneling adds texture and style to the wall beside the plant. This suggests an unchanged view, ensuring the wall features in both images are consistent.",
