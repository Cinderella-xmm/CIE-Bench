      "question": "Is the “GIOROUR” logo clearly visible on the balance beam?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the balance beam displays an engraved logo which reads 'GIOROUR'. This readability is achievable as the letters are prominently marked on the beam surface, making the brand name easily discernible. Combining this visual cue with knowledge of how logos are often prominently displayed on sports equipment, the logo is clearly visible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image of the gymnast on the balance beam in Image B illustrates her in an athletic pose with only one foot fully contacting the beam while the other leg is raised in a balancing pose. This indicates that both feet are not firmly placed on the balance beam. The positioning is a typical stance in gymnastics that is used to show balance and poise.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beneath the balance beam, a blue color can be observed, suggesting the presence of a protective mat commonly used in gymnastics settings to ensure the safety of athletes. The blue mat is distinct from the beam and support structures, allowing it to be easily recognizable.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examination of the support legs for the balance beam reveals a logo on the blue supporting structure where it reads 'GOTS'. This identification is based on the placement of the brand markings typically placed on supportive structures for recognition and branding purposes.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On inspection of Image B, the gymnast's hairstyle features a neat bun positioned on top of her head, and the bun includes a securing measure that is typically in the form of a hair tie. The tie is not visibly red, which is inferred based on potential visual discrepancies like lighting or editing choices.",
