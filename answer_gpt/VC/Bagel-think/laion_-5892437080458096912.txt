    "Question": "Q1: Is the subject's face, including the almond-shaped eyes, straight nose, and closed mouth with red lips, preserved in the same position and form?",

The editing has blurred or obscured these elements, making them unrecognizable. Therefore, the position and form as described cannot be verified.",
