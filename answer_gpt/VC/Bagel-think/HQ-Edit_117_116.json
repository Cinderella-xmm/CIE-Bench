      "question": "Are the pink-red feathery flower clusters present in both the foreground and background, positioned on slender green stems?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pink-red feathery flower clusters are indeed present in both the foreground and background. They are clearly positioned on slender green stems, which is evident from the visual cues showing the flowers attached to thin green lines that extend upwards. This arrangement suggests that the flowers are part of a plant structure, typically how they naturally grow.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a clear, symmetrical reflection of the dragonfly visible on the water surface directly beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragonfly's reflection is very prominent and clear on the water surface, directly beneath its position. The reflection is symmetrical, showing the same orientation and structure as the dragonfly itself, which is indicative of a calm and reflective water surface capable of producing such a clear reflection.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the water surface calm and reflective, with small sparkling particles scattered across it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The water surface in Image B does appear calm and reflective, as evidenced by the clear reflection of the dragonfly and other elements like the flowers. Additionally, there are visible small sparkling particles or droplets above the water's surface, enhancing the reflective quality and the overall serene appearance of the scene.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the dragonfly hovering just above the water surface, with its body parallel to the water plane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragonfly seems to be hovering close to the water surface, but its body is not exactly parallel to the water plane; it's angled slightly upwards. However, it still maintains a position that is close to the surface, suggesting a hovering action.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a bright, diffused light source in the upper center of the image, casting a golden glow through the green foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a bright light source in the upper area of the image, but it is more blue-toned rather than a golden glow. This light diffuses through the foliage, adding to the overall illumination of the scene. However, the tone of the light is not golden, indicating a different color balance in the editing.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there slender green stems and leafy structures extending from the water, supporting the pink-red flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, slender green stems and leafy structures do extend from the water, supporting the pink-red flowers present in the scene. These elements provide structural support to the flowers, which is visually evident from the connections between the flowers and the stems.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the background composed of blurred green foliage with visible patches of sunlight filtering through?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is indeed composed of blurred green foliage, which creates a sense of depth and natural ambiance. However, the sunlight filtering effect is not as pronounced due to the bluish light tone rather than the warm sunlight often associated with such effects. The use of a different light tone changes the typical perception.",
