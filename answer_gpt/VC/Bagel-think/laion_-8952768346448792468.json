    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the platinum blonde hair with visible waves and braided sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair color does not appear as platinum blonde but more closely resembles a dark brown or possibly auburn shade. It features an updo with decorative elements rather than the loose waves and braids seen in Image A. This is evident by observing the difference in hair styles and colors between the images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the facial features, including the jawline and eye shape, accurately preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the faces in Image B are blurred, any discernible facial features would likely not resemble those in Image A due to the significant differences in the artistic style and costume choice, which suggest differing contexts or character portrayals.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the subject depicted in a standing position with a slightly bowed head and hands clasped in front of the waist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is indeed depicted in a standing position with a posture that suggests a slightly bowed head and hands clasped in front of the waist. The overall body positioning closely resembles the original image, indicating that the key positioning has been retained despite other alterations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is a dagger present in the subjectâ€™s hands, held vertically with both hands clasping it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the subject with their hands clasped together in front of their waist, but there is no visible dagger held vertically. The inspection of the hands and their positioning does not indicate the presence of any weapon.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is positioned centrally between two lines of figures, as indicated by the symmetry and spacing of the background figures parallel to the subject's standing position. This central positioning is a common tactic used in art to draw focus and context to the central figure.",
