    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the hat still a wide-brimmed bucket hat with a broad, outward-facing brim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat still possesses a wide-brimmed shape that is characteristic of a bucket hat. The brim faces outward in a similar manner to what is typically seen in such hats. The changes in Image B mostly involve the pattern and colors of the hat, but not its overall shape or structure.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the eyes, nose, and mouth in their original positions and shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The section of the image where the eyes, nose, and mouth would be located is blurred out in both images, making it impossible to determine their positions and shapes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair appears to have retained its original light brown color and wavy texture on the visible portions. Despite the stylistic changes to other parts of the image, the hair itself hasn't been altered in terms of color or texture.",

      "question": "Is the visible portion of the clothing a white sleeveless top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible portion of the clothing now appears to have a teal color instead of the white seen in Image A. The pattern corresponds with the changes made to the hat. Therefore, the top has been clearly altered from its original white color.",

      "question": "Is the background a solid white with no additional elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the background is a solid white with no additional elements or distractions, ensuring focus remains on the hat and the person wearing it.",

    {

      "question": "Does the hat have a rounded crown with consistent height relative to the brim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hat in Image B maintains a rounded crown, similar to its original form in Image A. The height and overall structure remain consistent, indicating that despite pattern changes, the shape has not been altered.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the lighting even and bright across the face and hat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the lighting appears to be even and bright across the hat area, suggesting that no significant shadows or uneven lighting affects the hat. This implies controlled and uniform lighting conditions were maintained in Image B.",
