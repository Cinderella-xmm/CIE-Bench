    "Question": "Q1: Is the central dome present and positioned directly above the main structure?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a gingerbread model resembling a building. The model includes a distinct feature - a dome centrally positioned at the top. This design choice mimics traditional domed architectures, confirming the dome’s presence and alignment directly above the main body of the structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a golden star located at the very top of the dome’s spire?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the gingerbread dome features an icing design that resembles spikes or drips, but no golden star. The decorative icing is not colored gold nor shaped like a star, indicating that the top is not adorned with such a detail.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Are the windows arranged in a symmetrical grid pattern across the building’s front face?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the front face of the gingerbread building with a grid-like arrangement of windows, executed using white icing to represent the frames. The symmetry and regularity in the design reflect a grid pattern, consistent with architectural styles that prioritize symmetry.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a row of vertical columns forming a portico at the ground level of the building’s front?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible vertical columns forming a portico at the ground level. The lower section of the gingerbread structure appears to be flat without any column-like designs, indicating an absence of a portico.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there two large trees with golden-yellow foliage positioned symmetrically on both sides of the building?",

}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a straight paved road running in front of the building, parallel to its base?",

    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the building have a square base with rounded corners on the upper levels before transitioning into the dome?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the gingerbread structure on a square base, transitioning into an upper part with rounded corners before the dome. This architectural feature is visually represented through the gradual change from square to rounded sections, a common design in domed buildings for aesthetic harmony.",
    "answer": "Yes"
