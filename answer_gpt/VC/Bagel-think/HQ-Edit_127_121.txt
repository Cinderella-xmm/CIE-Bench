    "Question": "Q1: Is the circular orb-web with clearly defined radial and concentric threads still present and structurally intact?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the orb-web is visible with a clear circular shape and well-defined radial and concentric threads. This aligns with typical characteristics of arachnid webs used for capturing prey, maintaining its structure even in the edited version.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the branches positioned in a natural arc around the web, supporting it from multiple directions?",
    "explanation": "In both images, the branches indeed bend naturally around the web, with leaf structures seen supporting the web from multiple directions. The edited image retains the same branch arrangements as seen in the original image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the leaves retain their oval shape, visible venation, and glossy surface texture?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the oval shape, clear venation, and glossy texture of the leaves are preserved, identical to the characteristics depicted in Image A. This indicates consistent portrayal of leaf features in the edited image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there small, clear water droplets visible on the surfaces of some leaves?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the continuation of the presence of small water droplets on the leaves, similar to those observed in Image A. These droplets contribute to the realistic depiction of foliage in both images.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the background a soft, uniform pale blue-gray sky without additional elements such as clouds or sun?",
    "explanation": "In both the original and edited images, the background is depicted as a soft, uniform pale blue-gray sky, lacking any distracting elements like clouds or sun, maintaining a consistent backdrop focused on enhancing foreground details.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the web’s radial threads visibly connected to the branch ends at multiple points?",
    "explanation": "Image B demonstrates visible connection points between the radial threads and the branch ends, consistent with the structural and logical design seen in a spider’s web. This feature echoes the depiction in Image A, indicating the integrity of the web's attachment points.",
    "answer": "Yes"
