      "question": "Is the pig’s snout clearly visible with two distinct nostrils and a rounded, pink shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig's snout is prominently displayed, with two distinct nostrils apparent in the art style. The snout is round and pink, which aligns with the literal depiction of a pig's snout as commonly understood from both real-life and stylized illustrations. This is evident from the clear outlines and the artist's use of colors.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the pig’s ears large, upright, and pink with visible inner ear details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig’s ears are large and upright, consistent with a typical pig's ear posture. They are predominately pink with some visible details, an exaggerated feature often found in caricatures or cartoonish representations to accurately convey the species even in stylized art.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the sunglasses red in color with round lenses and a thin frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sunglasses worn by the pig in Image B are green in color with round lenses, contrary to the description. The frame is bold rather than thin, tailored for a cartoonish aesthetic that doesn't match the specification of being red and thin.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a black turntable with a silver platter, tonearm, and mixer controls beneath the pig’s hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a pig holding a microphone, with no visible turntable present. The setting suggests a performance rather than a DJ scenario. Thus, the description of a turntable with its components does not apply here.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are black over-ear headphones draped around the pig’s neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig holds a microphone with no over-ear headphones visible around its neck. The absence of headphones is consistent with a focus on vocal performance rather than music production, aligning with the illustration's theme.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the pig wear a red short-sleeved shirt with a visible collar and sleeves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pig in Image B is not wearing any clothing that includes a shirt, collar, or sleeves. As the character is depicted in a simplified cartoon form, clothing details seem to be omitted to maintain the cute, minimalistic design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the pig’s front hooves placed on the turntable platter and mixer controls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig is holding a microphone and there are no turntable or mixer controls depicted. The scenario suggests singing rather than DJing, and hence, the pig’s hooves are not interacting with any musical equipment.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the pig’s skin pink with visible texture, including subtle wrinkles and light reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a pig with a pink hue, consistent with many cartoon visuals where pigs are portrayed with this common color. However, the art style is simple and does not provide visible texture, wrinkles, or detailed light reflections. The design focuses more on stylization rather than realistic detail.",
