        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure on the badge appears with a recognizable crown and posture, which is characteristic of the Statue of Liberty. The statue is holding an object resembling a torch in its raised hand, a notable feature as seen in iconic imagery of the Statue of Liberty. Therefore, based on these visual cues, the badge does incorporate the Statue of Liberty holding a torch.",

      "question": "Is the Eiffel Tower depicted with its signature metal framework on the badge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the region within the badge where prominent structures are illustrated, but the specific framework details commonly associated with the Eiffel Tower are not visible. It primarily emphasizes the Statue of Liberty and the London Eye. Thus, the Eiffel Tower with its signature metal framework is not depicted on the badge.",

      "question": "Does the London Eye appear as a circular structure with gondolas on the badge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, within the circular badge, there is a representation of a Ferris wheel-like structure with visible gondolas along its circumference. This matches the iconic design of the London Eye, known for its circular structure with surrounding gondolas. Therefore, it is indeed depicted on the badge.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visual inspection of Image B reveals that the badge combines elements of the Statue of Liberty and the London Eye prominently, with no clear presence of the Eiffel Tower. Thus, these three landmarks are not all displayed together within the badge.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground clearly features a hand grasping the badge, with the fingers wrapped around its base and the hand taking up a significant portion of the image. This is a prominent aspect of the composition.",
