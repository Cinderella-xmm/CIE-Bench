      "question": "Are the irises of the eyes still blue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows vibrant blue hair which could indicate the presence of blue elements within the image, commonly associated with futuristic themes. Even though the face is blurred, based on the styling and complementary coloration choices, it would be logical to assume that blue irises may still be featured. However, the blur does not allow verification.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the facial structure, including the nose, jawline, and cheekbones, unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Facial features such as the nose, jawline, and cheekbones are typically distinctive for a subject as modeled. Image B displays a blurred face, making it difficult to recognize or compare specific facial structure details, such as the contours and outline. Therefore, without direct visibility, alteration cannot be assessed.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the subject positioned with a slight leftward turn of the body while facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's body is captured at a slightly angled perspective, with the torso shown from the side, hinting at a leftward turn although still facing forward. This aligns with common poses to accentuate costume details, typically forward-facing yet angled.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both arms positioned naturally at the sides of the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows no visible arms outside the futuristic attire, which conceals the natural arm position. This indicates that the arms may likely be inside or positioned naturally beneath the suit, so they appear concealed by form-fitting materials or blended with the photogenic posture.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the skin tone consistent with a natural light complexion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is shown with futuristic elements and lighting. Given these factors, skin tone might appear altered by artificial lighting or editing choices. Nonetheless, a natural light complexion is typically consistent with realistic styling choices for such themes, even if blur and lighting make direct assessment challenging.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the lips closed in a neutral expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has the subject's face blurred; direct lip analysis is not feasible. However, futuristic thematic styling often opts for minimalistic expressions to keep focus on outfit aesthetics rather than emotional display, suggesting a neutral expression might have been retained.",
