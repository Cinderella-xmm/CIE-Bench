      "question": "Are distinct horizontal sedimentary layers visible in the rock face of the cliff?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there isn't any visible cliff with horizontal sedimentary layers because the image primarily features a fantasy-like creature. Sedimentary layers are geological formations typically seen in nature, especially on cliff faces or canyon walls, but they're absent since the focus is on the creature. Without any cliff present, the visual cues necessary to identify sedimentary layers cannot be discussed.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a bright, linear reflection of the sun visible on the water surface extending from the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image is centered on an artistic rendition of a fantastical creature, without any visible water body. Without a sea, lake, or any body of water depicted in the scene, there cannot be a sun reflection on water. Usually, a linear reflection of the sun would be visible in a landscape featuring a horizon line of water, casting light from the position of the sun across the surface.",

      "question": "Are there multiple small boats visible on the water surface in the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Assessing the edited image, it focuses on a mythical creature, and no water body is depicted. Therefore, there can't be any boats visible on the water surface. Typically, small boats would be visible as silhouettes or small shapes on the horizon or water surface in a landscape painting or photograph that includes water.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are shrubs and small trees growing along the upper edges and crevices of the cliff?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image illustrates a fantastical creature without portraying a cliff with vegetation growing. Normally, vegetation like shrubs and small trees could be found along cliffs in nature, where there is enough soil for roots to take hold. However, without any landscape element resembling a cliff, these features cannot be assessed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are large, irregular boulders and grassy patches present in the foreground near the cliff edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "This edited image is a fantasy artwork focusing on a creature and lacks the landscape detail such as cliffs, boulders, and grassy patches. Large boulders and grass might typically feature in a naturalistic setting depicting cliffs, but this artistic creation does not include such natural terrain elements.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the sun located low on the horizon, emitting a warm golden glow across the sky and water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image revolves around a fantastical creature with no evident sun, horizon, sky, or water. While the artwork may have some similar atmospheric lighting effects suggesting warmth or glow, these effects aren't created by a sun on the horizon as it would be depicted in a landscape with sky and water.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the cliff edge form a steep, continuous drop-off directly into the water below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In this edited image, thereâ€™s no depiction of a cliff or water. It is primarily focused on a mythical creature and does not include natural features such as cliffs or bodies of water. Thus, we cannot describe or compare any steep drop-off or other related geographical features.",
