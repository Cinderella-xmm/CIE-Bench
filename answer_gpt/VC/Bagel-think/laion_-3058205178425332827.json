    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the bell tower with a domed roof and two arched windows clearly visible and structurally intact in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stylized and cartoonish depiction rather than a realistic rendering. While the structure is visually intact, it does not maintain realistic architectural accuracy typical of bell towers. Based on the cartoonish style, it could be identified as complete but simplified.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the large, dark mountain with a distinct peak visible in the background behind the city?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a stylized mountain with a distinct peak visible. It's rendered in simplified cartoon form, but the presence of a large mountain is obvious.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the docks and harbor structures clearly visible extending into the blue body of water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized representation of the docks and harbor structures is not detailed or prominent. The cartoon style prioritizes larger features rather than intricate details like docks. In a comparison, Image A presents clearer harbor details. Thus, Image B lacks clear docking structures.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the red-tiled rooftops of the foreground buildings still present and clearly colored in warm reddish-brown tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B’s depiction of rooftops retains warm tones but in a more vivid cartoon red than the possibly more realistic reddish-brown tones found in Image A. The presence of reddish hues is maintained but altered in tone and style.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the sky retain a dominant pink and purple gradient transitioning toward the horizon, with blue tones over the sea?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a gradient in the sky with pink hues, transitioning into blue tones over the water. The colors are vibrant but consistent with the gradient transition from Image A. The cartoon representation does not alter the gradient significantly.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the city positioned between the foreground rooftops and the distant mountain, with the sea to the right side of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B maintain a spatial arrangement of the city between foreground structures and the mountain in the distance, with the sea to the right. Image B’s rendition preserves the basic layout despite its cartoon style.",
