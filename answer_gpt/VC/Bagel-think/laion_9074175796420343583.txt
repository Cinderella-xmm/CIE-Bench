    "Question": "Q1: Is the crisscross lattice pattern of pastry strips visible on the pie's surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pie's surface features a checked pattern, which is a crisscross texture typical in latticework. However, it appears more like a cartoon depiction of a lattice, with less distinct strips than a real pie. This suggests the editing process transformed the realistic lattice pattern into a stylized cartoon interpretation, which still retains the general idea of a crisscross pattern.",

    "Question": "Q5: Are dark red sections of fruit filling visible through the gaps in the lattice crust?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no dark red sections of fruit filling visible.
