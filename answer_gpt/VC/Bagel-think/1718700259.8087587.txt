    "Question": "Q1: Is the \"POLICE\" and \"CME\" text present on the driver’s side door in the same position and font style?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text on the driver's side door says 'SALEE' and 'FAIE,' which is a typographical alteration, common in LEGO models for legal or branding reasons. Visually, it retains the same position and general font style but with different letters. In Image A, the lettering is 'POLICE' and 'CME.' Thus, while the position and style match, the content does not, making it a noticeable difference due to the letters being different.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the gold-colored badge emblem with a shield and star design located on the driver’s side door?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a gold-colored badge is present on the driver's side door; its visual characteristics imply a decorative purpose similar to actual police cars. Image A also features a badge emblem on the door. Both badges appear in the same position, maintaining the design theme, albeit the LEGO version likely simplifies the details. Therefore, despite the simplification, the badge is in the same place indicating the same design intent.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the rooftop light bar have the exact red-blue-red-blue color sequence from left to right?",
    "explanation": "The rooftop light bar in Image B shows a sequence that matches the typical pattern of police car light bars but uses LEGO's color format, which appears as red-blue. Although in real lift this would appear as red-blue-red-blue, it's visually consistent with traditional police lights albeit much simplified. Compared to Image A, which displays a clear red-blue-red-blue pattern, it is not exactly the same owing to the simplification, making the answer incorrect.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the front grille composed of horizontal slats with a central chrome bar?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the front grille is represented by a simplified LEGO aesthetic where a grid-like pattern is displayed in usual LEGO style, diverting from typical car grilles which have clearly defined horizontal slats. Image A depicts a realistic grille arrangement with discernible slats and a possible central section. The LEGO version doesn't accurately present this structure.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the license plate displaying \"LIP\" above \"CHICAGO POLICE\"?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO license plate displays altered text for branding or style reasons, appearing as nonsensical symbols or letters due to LEGO's detail limitations. Image A shows 'LIP' and 'CHICAGO POLICE.' The LEGO version's text doesn't match either layout or wording.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the car maintain the four-door sedan silhouette with a long hood and trunk?",
    "explanation": "Image B clearly depicts a four-door sedan shape, a prevalent design for patrol vehicles, replicated through LEGO's block formations that vaguely maintain the body style. Image A, an actual car, clearly displays this vehicular form, and despite simplifications, Image B retains this core aspect.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the rectangular headlights and amber turn signals positioned symmetrically on the front fenders?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the headlights and signals are represented by smaller LEGO pieces yet clearly maintain symmetry on the front, adhering to general car design principles. Image A shows accurate rectangular arrangements. Despite the simplistic approach in LEGO form, symmetry is intact in both images.",
    "answer": "Yes"
