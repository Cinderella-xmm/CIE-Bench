        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi illustration is designed based on visual cues such as clothing style and posture, which portrays the tennis player with the right arm extended slightly forward holding what could be an implied racket, and the left arm raised with the index finger pointing upwards, mimicking a fist pump action prevalent in sports to symbolize victory or encouragement.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a sticker illustrating a tennis player where the focus is on the representation of the player through styles and emblems.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is wearing a red dress and white visor, suggesting a close match to the basic shapes seen in tennis silhouettes. The visceral representation uses red shades likely to provide a thematic representation, but not matching the original orange dress from Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character as a chibi version where accessories like rackets are stylistically simplified. However, there isn't a specific representation of a black-filled shape resembling a tennis racket. The accessory detailing is minimal throughout all elements, including gestures suggesting the match of illustration style over particulars.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi character illustrated in Image B portrays a sports-related gesture similar to a fist pump, commonly seen in tennis as a sign of celebration or motivation. The visual cues of the left raised arm help define the symbolic tennis gesture, linking sports context and action representation.",
