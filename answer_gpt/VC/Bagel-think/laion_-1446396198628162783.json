      "question": "Is the NASA logo clearly visible on the left shoulder of the space suit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the space suit features a distinct NASA logo on the left shoulder. This can be observed in both the original and edited images as a visible circular logo that is iconic and represents NASA, which is common knowledge for those familiar with space agencies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red trim bands visible on the upper arm and lower leg of the space suit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit exhibits red trim bands on both the upper arm and lower leg, which are common design elements on space suits for identification and aesthetics, often used to distinguish different parts of suits or personnel.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question": "Is the white backpack unit attached to the back of the suit, with coiled white hoses extending down the sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a white backpack unit on the astronaut's back, accompanied by coiled white hoses that extend down the sides. This configuration is a typical setup for space suits, where such units provide life support and are visually connected via hoses.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the helmet’s visor partially raised, revealing part of the astronaut’s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show the helmet's visor as partially raised; rather, it has been blurred to conceal the face. In typical scenarios, helmet visors are either fully closed or positioned discreetly, but here the visor is maintained as down.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut is indeed standing upright with their body facing the right side of the image. This orientation is confirmed by the direction of the suit's frontal features and the alignment of the hoses and backpack.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hoses are clearly connected from the backpack to the suit at the torso area. This connection is crucial for the functionality of space suits, as it links life support systems to the suit’s integrated parts.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks the blue tarp that is present in Image A, which is used in various settings to protect surfaces or designate working areas. The absence of the tarp suggests a more refined, edited context for presentation.",
