        "Yes",
        "No"

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bit of the key retains the distinctive shape that resembles a cross or puzzle piece, similar to Image A. The cutout pattern is visually the same, indicating it has been preserved. Understanding that key bits often have defining shapes for specific locks supports the observation that this shape hasn't changed between the images.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shaft of the key in Image B exhibits segmented fluted ridges, which are decorative and common in ornate keys. Observing these features helps confirm they have remained unchanged from Image A, where the fluted design was likely originally intended to add grip or aesthetic detail.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The key in Image B shows a metallic bronze/gold color consistent with the appearance in Image A. This suggests the color scheme has been retained, often associated with decorative or antique keys. The metallic appearance gives a sense of authenticity and value, which has been consistently maintained in both images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the key is vertically aligned with the bow at the top, the shaft extending downward, and the bit at the bottom, which matches the orientation seen in Image A. This orientation is typical for how keys are depicted or displayed, emphasizing the vertical structure and functionality.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a wood grain texture that continues vertically, especially recognizable in the background around the key, similar to Image A. This suggests the texture is part of the setting, adding depth and realism to the scene, often used in backgrounds to convey warmth and natural aesthetics.",
