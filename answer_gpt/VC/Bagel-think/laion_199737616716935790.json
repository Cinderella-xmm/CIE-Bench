      "question": "Is the skull face with grinning teeth and hollow eyes located on the rear fender of the motorcycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle is depicted as a small, blocky assembly similar to a LEGO model, encased in a clear box. Analyzing the rear fender area, there are no visible designs or decals on this particular model, as it lacks detailed graphics. In contrast, Image A shows a more detailed design of a motorcycle with decal graphics that include a skull on the rear fender. Therefore, based on these observations, there are no such graphics in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a skull face with grinning teeth and hollow eyes positioned on the front headlight cowl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no skull or similar graphic is present on the front headlight cowl because the motorcycle in this image is a simplified, blocky representation without detailed graphics or decals. In Image A, there is a distinct skull graphic located on the front section of the bike. Given this comparison, Image B does not have the skull face on the headlight cowl.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the blue angular stripes present along the fuel tank, side panels, and front fairing in the same geometric configuration as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blue angular stripes in Image B are part of a blocky, geometric motorcycle model without intricate details. The stripes appear to be simple blue blocks assembled onto the model without following the specific configuration seen in Image A. Therefore, comparing the detailed graphics of Image A to Image B's simplistic representation, the geometric configuration does not match.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the “V-SDI” and “VFORCE3” decal visible on the lower side panel near the foot peg area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the simplified nature of the LEGO-like model, none of the detailed decals and logos present in Image A, such as 'V-SDI' and 'VFORCE3', are visible. Image B lacks any textural or graphical decals present in a real motorcycle's design as depicted in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the motorcycle shown in a side profile view facing toward the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the motorcycle model in a side profile view facing towards the left side of the image, opposite to the typical right-facing view seen in Image A. Thus, according to the visual cue in Image B, the model is oriented leftward.",

      "question": "Is the exhaust pipe located beneath the seat and curving downward toward the rear wheel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no clear depiction of an exhaust pipe due to the blocky design. The model doesn't have detailed mechanical parts like an exhaust pipe as seen in real motorcycles such as in Image A. Therefore, the exhaust pipe configuration can't be observed in this simplified model.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B represents the seat as a simple, blocky structure typical of LEGO-style models, lacking a smooth or curved surface or a raised backrest which is more characteristic of full-scale motorcycle seats as illustrated in Image A.",
