        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall behind the objects is light blue. This is visible through the overall hue and the lighting in the image, which reflects a soft, pastel color typical of a light blue wall. The unchanged position and lighting reinforce that the wall maintains its original light blue color.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crib is still present on the right side of the image, with clear visibility of its vertical bars and curved headboard.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the crib mattress still patterned with yellow and gray designs that resemble clouds. Although the new figures do not obscure the view, the pattern carries forward the same visual characteristics as in Image A, indicating the patterns were retained.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floor in Image B remains covered with a beige carpet. The texture and color of the carpet, which appear soft and neutral, lend continuity to the flooring from Image A, confirming it retains the same beige tone.",
