      "question": "Are the cabinet doors and drawers designed in a shaker style in both views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, analyzing the cabinet doors and drawers, they feature a flat center panel with square edges, typical characteristics of shaker style designs. Without referring to Image A, the style remains consistent throughout the visible parts, suggesting a classic and simple aesthetic. With this common style knowledge, it's clear that both views in Image B maintain the shaker design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do both the top-down and side views show two rectangular sink basins with consistent dimensions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible sections show two sinks which appear as rectangular basin designs under rectangular mirrors. Since the perspective is limited, direct details on dimensions aren't visible, but they seem consistent based on the mirror alignment and surrounding faucet positioning. Image A, consistently showing two rectangular basins, helps affirm that Image B mirrors this design, despite its angles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the black faucets present above each sink basin in both views with the correct orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the faucets are positioned above the sinks and oriented upwards, which visually appears correct based on a typical bathroom setup. In comparing this to Image A, where faucets are similarly oriented above each sink, Image B replicates this setup appropriately.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the countertop depicted in both views as a light-colored marble texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the countertop with light coloring and slight veining that resembles marble, a common choice for such design aesthetics. Image A enhances this comprehension, confirming that Image B indeed features a similar marble-like texture for the countertop in both visual perspectives.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains structural consistency with three central drawers flanked by two doors, typical of a standard dual-sink vanity. Comparing with Image A, both images show an identical layout, with no discrepancy in the arrangement, ensuring that Image B mirrors the original layout faithfully.",
