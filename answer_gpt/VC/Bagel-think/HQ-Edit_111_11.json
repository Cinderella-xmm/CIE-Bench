      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the facial features are blurred and not visible, making it impossible to discern the presence or absence of wrinkles or specific details like vertical lines on the forehead or crow's feet around the eyes.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the lighting appears different, and specific light sources above and behind the subject, as seen in Image A, are not discernible due to changes in the background and ambiance. Consequently, shadows on the subject's face do not follow the same pattern.",
