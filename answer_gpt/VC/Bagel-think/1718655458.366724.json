      "question": "Is the flowing brown and gray marbled pattern visible on the surfaces of the LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine the presence of a marbled pattern on the LEGO bricks in Image B, we focus on the visual cues. The LEGO bricks show an intricate surface design with warm brown elements that appear to imitate a marbled texture, visible through veins and sections on the bricks. This analysis is based on recognizing the characteristic patterns associated with marbling, which include irregular veins and color patches. Therefore, recognizing these brown patterns as marbling confirms their presence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the LEGO bricks rendered with a white base color accented by warm brown and gray marbling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO bricks in Image B display a predominant gray base color rather than white, which is accented by warm brown elements that resemble marbling. World knowledge about marbling that typically blends various colors helps identify these brown features as marbling accents. However, gray is the primary background color, not white.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the marbled veins follow an organic, irregular flow rather than a geometric or repetitive pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the marbled veins on the LEGO bricks are irregular in appearance and follow an organic pattern rather than a geometric or repetitive one. Observational analysis helps identify organic marbling characteristics such as non-linear, unpredictable flow and variations in thickness, which are evident in the bricks' surface features.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both warm brown and gray veins present together in the marbled pattern of the LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO bricks in Image B contain visible warm brown marbling, but there are no distinct gray veins integrated with it. The gray appears as the base color rather than as part of the marbled pattern, thus analysis shows that only the warm brown contributes to the marbling.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the LEGO bricks visually appear to be made of a marble-like material based on their surface pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the surface of the LEGO bricks imitates a marble-like pattern due to the intricate vein structure and color use resembling marble stone. World knowledge of marble's visual properties such as vein patterns and coloration allows for the assessment that the bricks appear marble-like.",
