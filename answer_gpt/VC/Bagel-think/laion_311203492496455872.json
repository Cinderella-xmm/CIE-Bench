    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the red circular insignia still present on the left lapel of the suit jacket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit jacket does not have a traditional design. It is a brightly colored, abstract patterned jacket. Given this transformation in the suit design, typical elements such as insignias might not be preserved. The lack of a red circular insignia indicates that it has likely been omitted in this edited version.",

    {

      "question": "Is the ear clearly visible on the left side of the head in its original anatomical position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ear is indeed present and correctly positioned anatomically on the left side of the head, beneath the vibrant pink, stylized hair. It maintains its original shape and visibility.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the mouth open in a natural smile showing the upper row of teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the blurring on the face area where the mouth would typically be seen, it's impossible to discern any details about the mouth, including whether it is open or smiling.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face is blurred, preventing visibility of any details of the nose, such as its shape. Therefore, the question about retention of shape and distinct features can't be ascertained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orientation of the head appears to be a straightforward frontal direction rather than a three-quarter profile, as inferred from the alignment of the visible ear and suit.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given the edited illustrative nature of Image B, it lacks realistic shadowing effects typical of photographs, making it unclear to discern such detailed lighting effects.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a distinctly colored and aligned shirt collar beneath the abstract suit jacket, maintaining its proper positioning relative to the neck, even though the style is highly stylized.",
