      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls feature a vibrant lime-green color, which is visually consistent with the lime-green appearance seen in sporting goods such as tennis balls and contemporary cleats.

      "question": "Do the nesting dolls retain the textured surface resembling the cleat's material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cleat in Image A has a smooth, leather-like texture, distinct from the fuzziness of a tennis ball. In Image B, the nesting dolls display a pebbled texture that reflects the cleat material. This indicates an effort to incorporate the aesthetic of the cleat's surface into the design of the dolls.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, the nesting dolls do not exhibit the fuzzy texture color synonymous with a tennis ball. However, the color and seam pattern are reminiscent of a tennis ball's design, illustrating a clever design merging elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nesting dolls in Image B are characterized by rounded, compact shapes, contrasting with the elongated shape of a typical soccer cleat seen in Image A. This indicates that the dolls maintain a distinct form factor, not adopting the cleat's silhouette.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls exhibit a rounded shape, echoing the form of a tennis ball. This suggests a deliberate design choice to evoke the spherical nature of a tennis ball within the dolls' structure.",
