      "question": "Is the helmet equipped with two curved horns and a central white feather-like adornment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the chibi character is wearing a helmet with two horns that are curved outward and upward, symmetrically positioned on either side. However, there is no visible central white feather-like adornment on the helmet. The absence of such an adornment can be verified by the clear visual structure of the helmet provided in the image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the character hold a round shield with a central boss and rivets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the chibi character does not hold a round shield. The character is positioned inside a snow globe with trees and there is no indication of any shield, thus lacking the features mentioned like a central boss and rivets.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a sword sheathed at the character’s back with a visible hilt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, unlike Image A, does not feature a sword sheathed at the character’s back. The character inside the snow globe is devoid of any visible accessories such as a sword or hilt.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the shoulder pauldron feature a swirling Norse-inspired engraved pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi character inside the snow globe does not display detailed engraving on the shoulder area resembling a swirling Norse-inspired pattern. The miniature design does not focus on intricate details, unlike the original image where such patterns are prominent.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Does the tunic have fur trim along its edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a chibi character in a simplified form, and while the character has clothing, there is no defined fur trim along its edges. The design lacks the elaboration seen in Image A, where fur trim is visible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character inside the snow globe exhibits a cartoonish design without detailed textures such as metallic finishes. The edited image opts for a simplified representation, eliminating the textures seen in full realistic armor.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the horns on the chibi character’s helmet are indeed curved outward and upward, positioned symmetrically on either side. This detail remains consistent even in the simplified figurine representation within the snow globe.",
