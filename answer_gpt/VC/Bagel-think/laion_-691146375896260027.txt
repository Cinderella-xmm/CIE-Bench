    "Question": "Q1: Is the overall bombe (curved, outward-bulging) silhouette of the commode preserved in the LEGO version?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO version of the commode is designed to mimic the bombe silhouette by using bricks to create an outward-bulging and curved form. This is evident in the way the sides and front are structured, using angular brick placement to suggest a swell in the shape, replicating the characteristic curved design of the original furniture style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there exactly two drawers stacked vertically on the front of the dresser, each framed by brass mounts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO commode appears to have features that suggest two horizontal panel separations representing drawers. These panels are framed by white LEGO bricks that stand in for the brass mounts. While the panels can be identified as drawer representations, the clarification on how accurate they might appear differs slightly from a real dresser.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the herringbone and starburst marquetry pattern visible on the front of both drawers in the LEGO version?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the front of the LEGO dresser with a uniform yellow surface, suggesting no intricate patterns. Real marquetry, such as herringbone and starburst patterns, is extremely detailed and involves complex designs that are not represented by the simple brick layout of the LEGO dresser.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the ornate brass mounts with acanthus leaf scrolls present around the edges of both drawers and along the side panels?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO dresser uses white bricks as a simple substitute for what are ornate brass mounts in the original design. While the arrangement of bricks resembles the general framing of these details, they lack the intricate acanthus leaf scroll designs found on the real commode.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the legs curve outward in a cabriole fashion and terminate in brass sabots?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO-based commode attempts to mirror the cabriole legs using bricks angled slightly outward. However, the strict geometric nature of LEGO does not allow for flowing curves, and there are no indications of brass sabots (foot coverings) present on the leg terminations.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a scalloped apron below the drawers, following the curve of the bombe shape?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a LEGO build that attempts to simulate this detail through brick placement that slopes and curves downwards, hinting at a scalloped apron. The execution, of course, lacks the smooth, flowing appearance of woodwork, but signals an attempt to replicate this design feature.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the top surface rectangular and flush with the upper edge of the dresser body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO commode features a clearly defined top surface made of rectangular bricks, which aligns with the top edge of the dresser structure, maintaining a flush design consistent with traditional commode construction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Are the decorative elements (brass mounts, marquetry, legs) symmetrically arranged on both sides of the dresser?",
    "explanation": "The LEGO version in Image B retains a degree of symmetry in its construction, mirroring the placement of panels and decorative brick outlines on both sides of the center. Although simplified, this symmetrical arrangement mimics how traditional decorative elements would appear on such furniture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
