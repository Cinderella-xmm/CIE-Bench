      "question": "Does the realistic cat figure retain the cream-colored body with dark brown points on the ears, face, paws, and tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a toy figure, not a realistic cat. The toy resembles a cat but is clearly a stylized, cartoonish version. It maintains the cream-colored body with dark brown points typical of a Siamese cat, which appear on its ears, face, and paws. Therefore, based on visual cues and the context of a figurine, the color pattern is retained in the toy, but it's not a realistic figure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the realistic cat figure have bright blue eyes with visible reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat figure is a toy characterized by exaggerated cartoon-like features, including very large and prominent blue eyes with visible reflections, tailored for a chibi aesthetic. Thus, while the toy has bright blue eyes with reflections, it's not a realistic figure.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the tail of the realistic cat figure curled tightly around its body, forming a dark ring underneath?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tail of the toy figure is not visible in a way that it forms a dark ring underneath the figure like the realistic depiction in Image A. The figure is in a box that doesn't showcase this feature distinctly.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the wooden windowsill present with visible horizontal planks and warm brown tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toy is housed inside a packaging box with a printed design that mimics window-like elements, including floral decorations, but lacks any detail resembling a wooden windowsill with horizontal planks. Thus, the wooden windowsill is not present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging design features floral motifs as part of the printed decoration on the box, but there is no distinct ceramic vase with blue floral pattern and pinkish-purple spherical flowers like in Image A. The vase is not physically or visually present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a toy figure with a smooth surface typical of manufactured plastic or vinyl, lacking the detailed and textured fur seen in the realistic cat of Image A. The representation is stylized and not designed to convey natural gradients and texture of real fur.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of a real window with an outdoor landscape, there is a box that has window designs with a drawn or printed floral and scenic background, not a real view with trees, hills, and an overcast sky.",
