    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the flag positioned at the top of the tallest central spire of the sandcastle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flag is located on the tallest central spire of the sandcastle, which is common for flag placements to signify the pinnacle point of a structure. This is derived from the visual position of the flag in relation to the other details of the sandcastle.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there two spiral staircases symmetrically positioned on either side of the central entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandcastle features one prominent spiral staircase leading up to the main entrance. This visual information indicates asymmetry in staircase placement, not symmetrical staircases on either side.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a central arched doorway with ornate latticework directly above it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a large central archway at the front of the sandcastle, and above it, elaborate decorations typical of latticework can be observed. This visual feature aligns with the typical design of grand buildings where central entrances are emphasized with ornamentation above.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there at least seven conical turrets visible around the perimeter of the sandcastle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are multiple conical turrets visible around the structure, totaling at least seven. This can be confirmed by counting the distinct conical shapes that are representative of turrets.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are starfish and seashells visibly present around the base of the sandcastle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict starfish and seashells around the base of the sandcastle as it appears protected under a glass dome with decorations contained within, contrasting Image A where such elements are present in a natural beach setting.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the sandcastle designed with bilateral symmetry along its central vertical axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandcastle demonstrates symmetrical characteristics along its central vertical axis. The placement of the central doorway and the flag on top supports this symmetry, a common feature in architectural designs to provide aesthetic balance.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there decorative carvings visible on the surfaces of the towers and archways?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows detailed and intricate carvings on the sandcastle, particularly around the archways and on the surfaces of the structures. This level of detail suggests attention to decorative artistry, typical in elaborate sand structures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the tallest tower located at the center of the sandcastle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon reviewing Image B, the tallest tower is indeed situated at the center of the sandcastle, marked by the central flag atop it, following typical architectural designs where the tallest part is often central for structural and visual prominence.",
