      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the layered petal structure around the rim of each vase, with individual petal shapes clearly visible and arranged in concentric rows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vases still feature a detailed rim embellished with petal-like structures. The petals are individually distinct and appear to be arranged in a layered fashion, creating a concentric pattern around the top edge of each vase. This is consistent with artistic ceramic designs where petals are often used as decorative elements, and the clarity of the shapes indicates detailed craftsmanship.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there exactly two vases present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the primary focus is on a single vase prominently displayed in front of a box featuring a similar vase as a printed image, which suggests a product packaging rather than two separate vases being present. The box includes elements of branding and is likely used for illustrative purposes. Therefore, only one actual vase is present in the image.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the interior of each vase still open and bowl-shaped, allowing visibility into the cavity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vase in Image B is designed with an open top, typical of a bowl shape, which allows full visibility into the hollow interior. This is evident from the clear depiction of the inside of the vase that follows a continuous curve from the rim to the interior, confirming the bowl-like design is retained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does each vase have a distinct, flared pedestal base beneath the main body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is shown with a flared pedestal base that supports the main body, typical of classical vase designs which often feature such bases for stability and aesthetic balance. The pedestal is visibly distinct from the main body of the vase, confirming this characteristic.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the two vases identical in shape, size, and orientation, with only minor positional offset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B only features one actual vase and one image of a vase on the box, suggesting that there are not two identical physical vases to compare. The box design showcases the vase as a product image, but it does not compel a comparison of physical attributes like orientation or size. Hence, there cannot be a positional offset for a comparison of two physical vases.",
