    "Question": "Q1: Is the toe box of the boot rounded?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the boot appears as an abstract, faceted object with sharp, angular lines creating a geometric and polygonal appearance. The toe box does not have a rounded shape; instead, it is composed of flat surfaces and angles. This suggests that the boot has a more angular design rather than a rounded one.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the boot have a V-shaped opening at the top of the shaft?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, despite the abstract representation, the top of the boot is characterized by a V-shaped cutout similar to western boots, although it's presented in geometric and angular form. The visualization still supports the presence of a V-shaped opening at the top.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a continuous white piping running vertically along the outer side of the shaft from the heel to the top?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the boot's design is abstract with black and white sections, but there is no visible distinct continuous white piping that runs vertically along the shaft's outer side. The abstract style does not depict traditional piping visually.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are decorative patterns present on both the upper shaft and the vamp area of the boot?",
    "explanation": "The boot in Image B exhibits a design composed of geometric shapes and angles. It does not have traditional decorative patterns that would be interpreted as designed motifs or stitches seen in typical boots, due to the abstraction of the boot's form into facets.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a distinct heel block elevating the rear of the boot?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear distinction of a heel in the boot design. Despite its abstract representation, the presence of a block-like structure at the rear indicates an elevation typical of a heel block.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the surface of the boot exhibit visible texture resembling leather grain?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents the boot with a surface composed of smooth, reflective, and angled geometric shapes. This design lacks any visible texture resembling leather grain as found in traditional materials.",
    "answer": "No"
