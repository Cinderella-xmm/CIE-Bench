      "question": "Are there exactly three triangular sails attached to the dhow, arranged in a staggered vertical line?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dhow has three triangular sails with intricate designs attached to it, positioned in a staggered vertical line, which is visually apparent from the sail arrangement and the layering based on perspective. This arrangement is similar to Image A, which features three triangular sails without intricate designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dhow have a wooden hull with visible arched windows and decorative lattice railings along the upper deck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a dhow with a wooden hull featuring visible arched windows and decorative lattice work along the upper deck. The ornate details are highlighted by the extravagant patterns on the sails. In Image A, similar architectural features are present, although the hull and detailing appear more subtle and realistic compared to B's stylized version.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the dhow oriented diagonally across the frame, with its bow pointing toward the upper right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dhow is oriented diagonally across the frame, with the bow pointing toward the upper right, which can be inferred from the angle of the sails and the direction of the hull. This diagonal orientation creates a dynamic composition in the frame. Image A also shares this orientation, confirmed by the visual perspective used.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there multiple small sailboats visible on the horizon in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display multiple small sailboats on the horizon in the background. Instead, it features fish in the water and distant architectural structures forming a skyline. Image A, however, includes multiple sailboats in the background, indicating a more typical maritime scene.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sun located low on the left side of the image, casting a bright golden reflection across the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include a sun reflection on the water, as the emphasis is on the bright and stylized design elements rather than realistic light effects. Image A, however, does show the sun located low on the left side with its golden reflection across the water surface, typical for a sunset scenario.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a visible wake and reflection of the dhow beneath its hull on the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the dhow is shown in water, there is no visible wake or water reflection beneath the hull. The water is stylized with decorative motifs instead of realistic wave patterns. Image A does display wake and reflections, indicating movement through water.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the dhow have a long, pointed bow extending forward from the hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the dhow with a prominent long, pointed bow extending forward from the hull, a characteristic measured by design aesthetics. Such a bow adds to the traditional maritime vessel design. Image A also shares this characteristic, albeit in a realistic setting of the dhow design.",
