      "question": "Does the robot still have two distinct upward-pointing antennae on its head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot’s head clearly features two upward-pointing antennae, which are typical in designs to suggest communication equipment or sensors on robots. These antennae are visible because they protrude distinctly from the top of the head, and this design element is easy to discern against the relatively uncluttered background. Given their distinct appearance, world knowledge about common robot designs supports the conclusion that they are still present.",

      "question": "Is there a blue-tinted visor visible on the robot’s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examination of the robot's face reveals a blue-tinted area, likely indicative of a visor. Visors are commonly used as protective eyewear or display screens in robot designs, and the blue hue provides a clue to its function as such. The reflection and hue are discernible enough to conclude this element is present.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there red glowing elements present on the robot’s chest and eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible evidence of red glowing elements on the robot's chest or eyes. Typically, glowing elements on robots serve as indicators, but there is no depiction of such features in this image, with the chest and eyes showing no red light emission or color.",

      "question": "Are the segmented armor plates with visible panel lines and rivets still present on the robot’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot displays a sturdy and detailed exterior, featuring segmented armor plates. The presence of panel lines and rivets are typical indicators of segmented armor as they show the construction detail and modular assembly commonly found in robot designs, suggesting that these features are still present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no distant city skyline such as tall towers or construction cranes visible in the miniature landscape. This landscape primarily focuses on a plain with two trees and some small features that are not distinctive architectural structures such as a skyline would have.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes small green trees clearly present in the miniature landscape, particularly visible at the edges of the platform on which the robot is showcased. Trees are often included in such miniatures to give a sense of scale and natural contrast, making them easily recognizable in this setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain a visible dust cloud beneath the robot's right foot. The robot is standing on a structured platform in a miniature display, which usually does not depict dynamic environmental effects such as dust clouds.",
