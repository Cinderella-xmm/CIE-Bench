      "question": "Does the edited image retain the original four blades of the ceiling fan?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ceiling fan has four blades in a symmetrical arrangement around the central hub. This visual information aligns with the common design of a four-bladed fan. Given this setup, the edited image does indeed retain the original four blades of the ceiling fan.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the central hub structure of the ceiling fan still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's a clear presence of a central hub structure from which the fan blades are extending. This resembles the traditional design of ceiling fans where the central hub acts as the point of rotation for the blades. Thus, the central hub structure is still present in the edited image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image preserve the metallic texture and color scheme of the ceiling fan?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fan blades and hub exhibit a metallic texture and a similar grayish-silver color scheme. This is consistent with Image A, which also features a metallic texture and color. The edited image retains this aspect in its design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the blades arranged symmetrically around the central hub in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "The blades in Image B are evenly spaced and extend from the central hub, maintaining a symmetrical layout typical of ceiling fans. This symmetry is consistent with a balanced structure needed for efficient fan operation, confirming that the arrangement is symmetrical.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the connection points between the blades and the central hub visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the connection points where each blade meets the central hub can be seen clearly. These points are vital for the structural integrity of the fan, indicating how the blades are attached and enabling their rotation. Thus, these connection points are visible.",
