      "question": "Are the brown and white mesh patterns visible on the giraffes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffes are depicted in a cartoonish style, and although the pattern is stylized, the brown and white mesh-like spots, which are characteristic of giraffes, are still clearly visible. This patterning helps identify the animals as giraffes and maintain a resemblance to their real-life appearance.",

      "question": "Are the ossicones present on the giraffes' heads?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Ossicones are the horn-like protuberances on a giraffe's head. In Image B, although the giraffes are in a cartoonish form, the ossicones are still present and depicted atop their heads, aligning with common knowledge of giraffe anatomy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the giraffes positioned naturally relative to the grassy field and trees in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the cartoon style, the giraffes appear to be standing on the ground and are positioned in a way that suggests they are part of the scene, relative to the grassy field and trees. Their placement is consistent with how giraffes would usually be seen in their natural habitat.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background composed of grass, trees, and rocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes stylized representations of grass, trees, and rocks. Even though the style is more simplistic and cartoon-like, these elements are clearly identifiable, demonstrating consistency with a natural setting similar to Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the general body structure of the giraffes, including their legs and torso, remain intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the giraffes in Image B are rendered in a cartoon style, their body structure is recognizable, maintaining the elongated neck, legs, and torso characteristic of real giraffes. This stylization does not compromise the fundamental structure that signifies a giraffe.",
