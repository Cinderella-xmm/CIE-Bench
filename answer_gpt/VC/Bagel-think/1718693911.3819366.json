        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's fur is shown with very bright colors filled in certain areas, indicating a stylized or artistic representation rather than a lifelike depiction.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat appears to be sitting in a manner that suggests a typical upright posture with the front paws forward. The lines in the illustration indicate the positioning of the body and its limbs in a manner conforming to a sitting posture. This analysis is based on how the cat's body is traditionally drawn or stylized in such art forms.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a stylized representation looks like a hot dog is placed in front of the cat, but the hot dog depiction does not show any zigzag mustard pattern on top. Instead, the details are simplified with plain colors.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the harness is represented with clear line drawings indicating it wraps around the neck and chest area of the cat. However, the buckle and pouch-like attachments seen in realistic images may not be depicted with all the intricate details due to the stylized nature of the art.",
