        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sofa appears to be black, which aligns with common designs for minimalistic or modern living rooms. There are multiple cushions visible on the sofa, and they appear to be evenly arranged, providing a neat and organized look. This observation is consistent with the original design philosophy of having symmetric or orderly arrangements in interior decor.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the large painting is positioned centrally and directly above the sofa, suggesting intentional placement to create a focal point in the room's design.
