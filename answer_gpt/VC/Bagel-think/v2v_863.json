      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No\n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is represented as a chibi-style figure. This type of representation typically emphasizes cuteness and exaggerated features. The elephant in Image B has noticeably large, round eyes, an oversized head, and distinct ears. The ears are indeed large relative to its body, which is characteristic of an elephant, and the trunk is evident, with small tusks displayed. By taking these visual cues into account, the large ears, tusks, and trunk are retained but stylized.",

      "question": "** Does the edited image show the elephant in a posture that suggests it is carrying something heavy?\n**",
      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No\n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is depicted in a playful, chibi-style with a happy and relaxed demeanor. The posture is upright and carefree, not showing any physical signs of strain or effort one would associate with carrying something heavy. Furthermore, there is no visible object being carried, nor any indications of such an activity, suggesting a light-hearted rather than burdened appearance.",

      "question": "** Does the edited image retain earthy tones and a textured appearance for the elephant's skin?\n**",
      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No\n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant appears as a smooth, cartoon-like figure typical of chibi art, with a simplified and toned-down color palette. The skin texture is not realistic or textured, but rather smooth and homogeneous, and the color is a uniform gray, which shifts away from the earthy tones and textures present in realistic art styles.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a cheerful, whimsical setting with playful elements like the cartoonish elephant and cereal box. It has a warm and inviting tone with soft lighting, contributing to a serene and harmonious atmosphere. Bright colors, rounded forms, and a non-cluttered background further add to the calming and pleasant ambiance.",

      "question": "** Does the cereal box design visually represent robust whole grains, nuts, tropical fruits, and natural sweeteners?\n**",
      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No\n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "The cereal box design in Image B shows illustrations of a bowl filled with what looks like cereal grains, surrounded by stylized images of various fruits like lemon, tomato, and an unidentified orange fruit, as well as beans. These visuals suggest an inclusion of whole grains and fruits, though not explicitly showing nuts or directly identifiable tropical fruits. The design focuses more on simplicity and style, evoking a natural, healthy theme without being explicit about each ingredient.",
