    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the lion’s head medallion present at the center of the desk's front panel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central panel of the ornate box depicts intricate patterns and golden embellishments, yet lacks the distinct feature of a lion’s head. By interpreting these visual cues and comparing them with common representations of a lion’s head medallion, this specific detail is absent.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the quill maintain its feather shape, even if stylized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The quill in Image B is designed with a feather-like shape, featuring the shaft and barbs characteristic of a quill, regardless of its stylization into metal or an exaggerated form. This demonstrates consistent visual symbolism of a feather.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the book depicted as open, showing two pages of aged, yellowed paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not display a book with visible pages. Instead, it shows a closed box. Based on these observations and the absence of visual cues related to an open book, the scene deviates from portraying pages directly from a book.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the desk retain its dark wood texture and finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an object with intricate carvings and gold motifs but lacks the appearance and characteristics of dark wood as seen in traditional desks. Therefore, based on these observations, the dark wood texture is not present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B shows a plain beige surface without any window features. This contrasts with a detailed arched window structure typical in architectural designs involving leaded glass panes.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are tall bookshelves with rows of leather-bound books visible to the left of the desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B predominantly displays the ornate box and writing set without any depiction of bookshelves or books. The setting lacks the context of a library or study with visible bookshelves.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering Image B, there is a consistent use of brown and cream colors, but the presence of deep red/blue shades is absent. The color scheme is predominantly brown and gold, suggesting a different palette than the original scene's mix",
