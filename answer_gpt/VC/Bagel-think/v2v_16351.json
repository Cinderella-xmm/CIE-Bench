      "question": "Are the individuals' facial features, hairstyles, and body types retained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the individuals' hairstyles and their body types underneath the clothing appear consistent with typical representations of Italian football jerseys and suits, indicating that their general silhouette might be maintained. However, facial features cannot be assessed due to blurring, thus we cannot confirm if those specific traits are retained.",

      "question": "Is the man in the suit still gesturing with his hands in the same manner as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man in the suit is making the same hand gesture, extending his hands outward, which is consistent with the original image. This suggests that his body language and movements are maintained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the three individuals remain in the same relative spatial positioning as in Image A: the man in the suit is on the right, the two individuals in jerseys are on the left. This implies consistency in their relative positions.",
      "weight": 1,

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B still shows the individuals in similar attire as Image A, including the man in a formal suit and the individuals wearing football jerseys. This indicates that their outfits have not changed.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an armchair occupying the central space, which draws the observer's attention similarly to the jersey in Image A. This serves as a visual replacement and focal point compared to the earlier image.",
