      "question": "Is the cabin’s roof clearly shaped as an A-frame with snow covering its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a cabin with a distinctly triangular roof structure typical of an A-frame design. The light blue shading indicates snow coverage, a common feature for such cabins in wintry settings. Snow appears to be distributed evenly over the roof's surface, emphasizing the cabin's location in a snowy environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a chimney located at the peak of the roof, from which smoke is rising?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a chimney positioned near the peak of the cabin’s roof. Smoke is visible rising from the chimney, suggesting it is in use, likely for heating or atmosphere. Chimneys are often located at or near the highest point of a roof to efficiently funnel smoke away, particularly in cabins designed for colder climates.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there exactly three illuminated windows on the upper level and three on the lower level, including one central window on the ground floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two illuminated windows visible on the upper level of the cabin, flanking the central axis of the structure. On the lower level, three windows are visible: two flanking the porch area and one central window on the ground floor. The analysis highlights there are fewer windows illuminated on the upper level compared to the description in the question.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the walls of the cabin constructed from visible horizontal logs with chinking between them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows walls that appear structured from horizontal logs, suggestive of a log cabin design. However, a closer inspection does not show visible chinking between logs. While the cabin maintains a rustic log appearance, the detailing lacks clarity that precisely identifies the presence of chinking.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there tall, snow-covered evergreen fir trees surrounding the cabin on all sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays tall evergreen trees covered with snow surrounding the cabin. Evergreen firs are typical in such wintry scenes, providing an ambient backdrop and emphasizing the cabin's secluded, forested environment. The cabin appears embraced on all sides by these trees, enhancing the sense of isolation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there smoke visibly rising vertically from the chimney into the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chimney emits smoke that ascends vertically into the sky, forming a clear grey stream. This aligns well with the characteristic activity of a chimney in use during colder weather conditions. Vertical smoke suggests an absence of strong lateral winds affecting its direction.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates glowing string lights adorning the roofline beneath the eaves of the cabin. These lights contribute to a festive or decorative appearance, which is typical in holiday or celebratory winter scenes. The lights accentuate the cabin's warm and inviting atmosphere.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features small shrubs placed symmetrically on either side of the cabin’s front porch. These shrubs appear snow-covered, consistent with the overall wintry theme. Such arrangements are typical for cabin landscapes, adding to the picturesque and charming composition.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a split-rail fence partially submerged in snow in the foreground, extending from the cabin toward its left and right sides. The snow accumulation suggests the fence has been exposed to significant snowfall, reflecting typical conditions around such a cabin in a snowy environment.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B captures falling snowflakes dispersed throughout the scene, notably around the cabin and in the sky. The visual representation of snowflakes enhances the perception of an ongoing snowfall, which is typical in creating a dynamic and atmospheric wintry landscape.",
