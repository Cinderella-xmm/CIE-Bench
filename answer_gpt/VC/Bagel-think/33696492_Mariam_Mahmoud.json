      "question": "Are there exactly three chairs positioned in a row, facing the bookshelf wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed three chairs visible positioned in a row, facing toward the bookshelf wall. They are evenly spaced and directed forward, clearly indicating a seating arrangement with a view of the shelf. This is consistent with the question's description.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there two hanging pendant lights located above the seating area, one closer to the center and one toward the right edge of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hanging lights above the seating area are visible. However, instead of the typical pendant lights, there are three stylized lights; two are shaped like mushrooms and one has textual design, which deviates from the described arrangement of two simpler pendant lights. This mismatch with the question's setup makes the answer 'No.'",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the floor display a pattern of parallel diagonal shadows cast by sunlight entering from the right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible shadows cast on the floor, nor is there any indication of diagonal shadow patterns caused by sunlight from any particular direction. Instead, the floor appears uniform, lacking such pronounced lighting effects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a full-height wall of wooden shelves running along the left side of the room, divided into multiple evenly spaced rectangular compartments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall of shelves runs along the background and not specifically on the left side. These shelves are divided into evenly spaced compartments but adorned with decorative elements like white birds, giving a more magical touch rather than being strictly utilitarian.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the floor composed of light-colored wooden planks laid horizontally, extending from foreground to background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floor comprises light-colored wooden planks that are laid horizontally, extending from the foreground into the background. The design of these planks is consistent with the description provided.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features different decorative objects in the shelves, including unique items such as white birds and other ornamental pieces, but there is no specific white vase or clearly identifiable blue box with text. The arrangement is more fantastical, unlike the question's reference to specific objects.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the primary color palette includes natural green hues, indicative of moss and forest elements, as well as brown and other earth tones due to the stylized design. Although some brown is present, these choices are complemented by greens and other colors, deviating from a solely golden-brown scheme.",
