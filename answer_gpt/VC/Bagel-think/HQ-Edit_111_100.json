      "question": "Is the fan-shaped headdress with radiating elements present on the warrior’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the warrior has a block-like structure resembling a simplified headdress with geometric features like a LEGO design. However, it lacks the intricate, fan-shaped details seen in typical radiating headdresses. Thus, given this design style, the presence of a traditional fan-shaped headdress is not evident.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a circular emblem located at the center of the chest plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts the chest area of the warrior with rectangular block designs typical of a LEGO style. There is no circular emblem visible; instead, there are blocky, linear features. Therefore, the circular emblem at the center of the chest plate is absent.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is a spear held in the warrior’s right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a sculpted LEGO warrior figure where the right hand holds an object. This object has the semblance of a spear-like shape, with a pointed design, typically associated with the tip of a spear. Hence, a spear is indeed held in the warrior's right hand.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the torso and legs covered in layered, scale-like armor pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the warrior's torso and legs showcase clear block-like, rectangular designs, typical of LEGO construction, which do not resemble the layered or scale-like appearance seen in traditional warrior armors. Hence, the layered, scale-like armor pieces are not present.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the statue placed on a white pedestal with two visible plaques at the front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pedestal in Image B is white, and two rectangular plaques are visibly attached to the front side. These plaques suggest information typically provided in galleries. Thus, they indeed accompany the white pedestal.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are framed landscape artworks visible on both side walls of the gallery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows framed artworks decorating both sides of the gallery walls. Each side contains multiple frames, and though specific landscape details are not distinguished, the characteristic square frames confirm the presence of framed artworks.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the statue centered in the gallery space with equal spacing to the side walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO warrior statue is positioned such that there appears to be regular, balanced spacing from the central statue to each gallery wall, providing a symmetrical visual appearance within the gallery setup.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is a shield-like object held in the warrior’s left hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the warrior’s left hand is visible, clutching an object that does not exhibit typical shield characteristics—such as being broad and flat. Instead, it seems to be empty or without a shield-like form. Therefore, no shield-like object is held.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Does the warrior have a broad nose, deep-set eyes, and a stern mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image portrays the warrior figure with a blocky LEGO-style face. This style doesn't include realistic facial features like a broad nose, deep-set eyes, or any mouth expression. Hence, these specific facial features are not depicted in this image.",
