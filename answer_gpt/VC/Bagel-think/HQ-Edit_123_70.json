    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the bear's body shaped with a distinct hump over the shoulders and a broad, muscular back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear appears to have a distinct rounded back with some thickness indicating muscle. However, due to the illustration style, the hump over the shoulders is not clearly defined compared to real bear imagery, which typically should have a notable hump over its shoulders.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the salmon have a clearly defined forked tail fin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration style simplifies the depiction of the fish, resulting in the tail fin appearing less defined. The tail does not clearly exhibit a fork-like shape that is characteristic of many salmons.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the bear’s fur rendered with visible texture and layered shading, showing wetness and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bear in Image B is illustrated with some attempts at texturing its fur to depict depth, but the style lacks detailed layered shading that would convey wetness and realistic fur texture. The fur does not exhibit visible depth and wetness as seen in realistic renderings.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the salmon colored with a blue-green back and a silvery-white belly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The salmon in Image B appears to have varied color tones, with some resemblance to blue-green and silvery colors, but lacks clarity and distinctiveness in these specific colors due to the stylized illustration rendering.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible water splashes or ripples around the bear’s lower legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surroundings of the bear lack distinct water splashes or dynamic ripples that would be expected when an animal interacts with water; the depiction is static and does not illustrate this activity element.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the bear have a long, broad snout with visible nostrils and a rounded muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear's snout is portrayed simply with less detail. The nostrils and detailed muzzle shaping are not prominently visible due to the stylized art, which does not focus on anatomical accuracy.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the salmon positioned horizontally in the bear’s mouth, with its head protruding forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the position of the salmon in the bear's mouth is not oriented horizontally with its head protruding forward. The illustration depicts the fish in a somewhat non-specific positioning, without clear orientation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
