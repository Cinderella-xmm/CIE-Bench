      "question": "Are the four individuals still seated together in the same relative positions inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual cues show three chibi-style characters sitting together inside a snow globe, not four as in Image A. The relative positioning inside the snow globe may be similar to that in Image A, where individuals sit close together side by side on a couch, holding game controllers. However, since there are only three characters instead of four, it's not the same arrangement as in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the chibi-style characters retain identifiable facial features and clothing styles of the original individuals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, chibi-style characters typically have simplified and exaggerated features, making facial features less identifiable compared to realistic images. However, clothing styles such as long sleeves and color coordination can be simplified versions of what is visible in Image A. Both images depict characters in similar positions with controllers in hands, supporting that clothing elements might retain some resemblance.",

      "question": "Are the characters still holding game controllers in their hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi characters clearly have game controllers in their hands, similar to Image A where individuals are depicted holding controllers while seated. This visual cue indicates that this detail remains consistent between the two images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows chibi characters wearing casual clothing like sweaters and long pants, similar to the casual attire (such as sweaters and denim) visible in Image A. The use of long sleeves and the color tones also matches the casual style exhibited by the individuals in the original image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, within the snow globe, the chibi characters appear to be seated, indicated by their sitting posture and alignment. However, there is no clear and distinct representation of a couch or similar seating furniture as presented in Image A. Instead, the characters seem to be sitting on a flat elevated surface, which is not explicitly a couch.",
