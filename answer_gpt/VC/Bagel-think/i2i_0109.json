      "question": "Does the plastic figurine still hold a hammer that glows with blue lightning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine holds a hammer resembling Thor's iconic Mjölnir, which is glowing blue, suggesting lightning, a characteristic feature of Thor's weapon from the comics and movies. This detail is retained from Image A, where the character's hammer is similarly depicted. My analysis of Image B confirms the presence and glow of the hammer through visual cues such as the color and energy effect alongside world knowledge of Thor's abilities and weapons.",

      "question": "Is the detailed black armor with metallic and gold accents retained on the figurine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B maintains the detailed armor design, which includes black with metallic and gold accents. This matches the depiction in Image A, where Thor's costume is defined by an intricate armor sporting these colors. The evaluation of Image B's armor considers common traits of Thor's armor across various media inputs such as movies and comics.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the figurine with a red cape draped over the shoulders, consistent with Thor's typical costume. This is visually apparent in the figurine’s presentation, and the comparison to the original Image A confirms the continuation of this classic feature. Common representations of Thor include a distinctive red cape, a trait confirmed by visual analysis.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine displays long blond hair, mirroring Thor’s iconic hairstyle. However, the face is intentionally blurred, making the evaluation of a beard impossible without relying on Image A, which also depicts long blond hair consistent with traditional portrayals of Thor in media. The analysis is informed by visual recognition of Thor’s features, excluding facial hair due to the blur effect.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pose in Image B is not the same; the figurine is depicted with an arm raised holding the hammer, differing from the stance and position in Image A, where the character has both arms down. This analysis compares the posture and arm positions using visual inspection of both images.",
