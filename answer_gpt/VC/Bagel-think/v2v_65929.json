      "question": "Is the spatial arrangement and relative positions of the machinery consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the added colorful candy and chocolate elements, the machinery's spatial arrangement and relative positions appear to be unchanged compared to Image A. The same sequence of machinery and their alignment against the wall is visible, indicating consistency in their arrangement.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the ceiling trusses still providing structural support in the same manner as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the whimsical additions beneath, the ceiling trusses visually remain unchanged. They continue to provide structural support for the ceiling in the same manner as depicted in Image A, suggesting their functional role hasn't been altered.",

      "question": "Does the overall proportions and layout of the room match the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The proportions and layout of the room in Image B, regarding wall length, ceiling height, and overall spatial dimensions, appear consistent with Image A. The humorous addition of candy and chocolate elements does not seem to impact the actual architectural proportions or layout of the room.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the position and extent of the wall (now transformed into gingerbread) consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall's position concerning the machinery and overall room structure remains unchanged from Image A, despite its transformation into a gingerbread-like appearance. The extent or length of the wall appears consistent with its position in the original image.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the floor (now a river of chocolate) still serve as a base for the machinery in the same way as the original concrete floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the floor is depicted as a chocolate river, the machinery seems to maintain its grounding and arrangement consistent with Image A. The new graphical representation does not appear to affect the functional role of the floor as a base for the machinery and equipment's placement.",
