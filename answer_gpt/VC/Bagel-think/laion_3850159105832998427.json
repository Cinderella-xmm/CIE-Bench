      "question": "Is the \"Gibson\" logo in gold script visible on the headstock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area of interest is the headstock of the guitar. The 'Gibson' logo is commonly found on the headstock of guitars of this brand in a gold script font. Upon examining the headstock in Image B, one can see the familiar 'Gibson' logo clearly presented in gold script, consistent with the brand's typical design. This conclusion is drawn by recognizing the graphical style and position of the logo on the guitar, which aligns with real-world Gibson guitar appearances.",

      "question": "Are there exactly six fiery tendrils extending from the bridge to the headstock area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited elements of the guitar include artistic additions resembling fiery tendrils or serpentine appendages, which are visually distinct due to their bright and vivid colors against the darker guitar body. By counting the tendrils that extend from the lower to upper portions of the guitar, particularly from the bridge to the headstock area, we can see that there are indeed a total of six fiery tendrils. This detailed inspection involves identifying the individual tendrils and confirming their count, linked by these signature dragon-like features.",

      "question": "Is the guitar oriented vertically with the neck pointing upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the orientation of the guitar is established by the position of the headstock relative to the body. This particular image shows the guitar standing upright, with the neck clearly extending upwards and the broader body part down below, maintaining a vertical orientation standard to how guitars are generally displayed. This analysis revolves around the visual perception of vertical alignment from top (headstock) to bottom (body), which matches common ways of depicting guitars in images.",
