      "question": "Is the window located at the top center of the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the window is positioned at the top center of the house. The window is a small rectangular shape placed symmetrically between the edges of the roof. This placement is typical for a central window and is visually aligned with the peak of the A-frame roof.",

      "question": "Is the chimney positioned on the left side of the roof?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chimney is prominently visible and is located on the left side of the roof, as evidenced by its position on the left edge from the viewer's perspective. The chimney is a distinctive part of the building, with a black top and a metallic finish.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the house have an A-frame roof with a pointed peak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows that the house has a steep A-frame roof, characteristic of this architectural style. The roof forms an acute angle at its peak, which is a notable feature of an A-frame design, pointing sharply upward.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a large circular opening in the front of the house where the nest is located?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a large circular opening is present in the front of the house, where several gears and cogs are visible instead of a nest. The mechanical components take the place of where a natural nesting feature would traditionally be, suggesting a thematic shift in design from natural to mechanical.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the stork located inside the nest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stork is present within the large circular opening which is now filled with mechanical gears instead of a nest. The stork remains at the same relative position, although its natural surroundings have been transformed into mechanical ones.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there yellow flowers and a path visible in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Unlike Image A that has yellow flowers in the foreground, Image B lacks these elements. The foreground in Image B focuses on the house itself without any visible flora or path features. The scene is more industrial in aspect, without the natural elements present in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are green trees and a textured sky visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background does not feature green trees or a detailed, natural sky that Image A had. Instead, the space is stark, with a patterned yet less organic texture suggesting a more artificial or stylized environment.",

      "model_answer": "No",
