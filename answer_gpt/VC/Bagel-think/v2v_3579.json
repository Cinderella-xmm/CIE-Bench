      "question": "Is the salmon nigiri present with its characteristic orange-pink color and textured surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no pieces that exhibit the characteristic features of salmon nigiri, such as an orange-pink color and a textured surface. Instead, the image predominantly consists of sushi pieces that are small, uniform, and have green fillings, which are not indicative of salmon nigiri.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are multiple small, uniform sushi pieces with visible cylindrical shapes and fillings that appear to be green and some hinting yellow-orange. These features are characteristic of maki rolls, which typically have such a structure with distinctly visible fillings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays sushi pieces with a clear black seaweed outer layer, which is common in sushi preparations. The edges are visibly defined and create distinct shapes often associated with sushi rolls, especially maki rolls.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image clearly shows a white rectangular plate with rounded corners positioned centrally on a dark surface. This setup is typical for presenting food and is clearly visible and identifiable.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a clear glass containing a transparent liquid, presumably water, positioned in the top-left corner of the frame. This placement is consistent with typical table settings where a drink might be within easy reach.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a dark surface with visible gray veining, resembling a marble texture. This pattern is distinguishable and notable, suggesting a stylized presentation surface.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the glass of water located in the top-left corner, separate from the plate but within the same frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass containing liquid is positioned in the top-left corner, separate from the plate, yet still within the frame of Image B. This placement is typical for such an object and as observed, it maintains a distinct separation from the plate while being part of the overall image composition.",
