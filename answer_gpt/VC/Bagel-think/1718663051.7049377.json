    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there exactly one tree positioned in the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a singular tree positioned prominently in the center of the image, which is a common design in stained-glass style artworks where central figures are often highlighted. The tree's symmetrically arranged silhouette and placement are consistent with the artistic style that emphasizes a central focal point.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the tree have a clearly defined layered canopy structure with multiple horizontal tiers of foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree features a layered canopy structure with horizontal tiers of foliage. This is identifiable due to the distinct patterns within the silhouette that suggest multiple layers. The artistic representation uses lines and curves to mimic the natural layers of a tree's foliage, typical for stained-glass designs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the tree positioned in front of the mountain range in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree is placed in front of shapes that resemble mountains. The tree's outline intersects and overlays these background shapes, indicating its position in front of the mountain-like forms. This positioning creates depth typical in stained-glass art to represent layered scenes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible shadow extending from the base of the tree onto the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the representation of shadows is absent due to the nature of the stained-glass art style, which uses sections of color and line rather than depicting light and shadow play. The design does not incorporate realistic shadows extended from objects.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a flat grassy plain beneath the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area beneath the tree is not depicted as a flat grassy plain. Instead, it consists of abstract geometric sections typical in stained-glass art that use lines and color contrasts rather than realistic ground textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there mountains visible in the background behind the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes abstract shapes that resemble mountains. These shapes are situated behind the tree, creating a sense of landscape depth often used in scenic stained-glass artwork. The use of contrasting colors and curves is typical to represent mountains.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
