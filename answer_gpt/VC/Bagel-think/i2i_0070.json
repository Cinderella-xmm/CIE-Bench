      "question": "Is the train labeled \"BB 3017\" still visible and legible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train is visible, and the text 'BB 3017' on the front of the train is clearly seen. This conclusion is drawn from the recognizable and distinct typography on the train's front despite the change in lighting and background.",

      "question": "Are the railway tracks, including the parallel tracks beside the main line, still intact and correctly laid out?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground railway tracks are visible, but the parallel tracks beside the main line are not distinctly visible or clearly laid out. This assessment is made because the focus is mainly on the immediate track where the train is positioned, and the background details are obscured in darkness.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the train remaining centrally positioned on the railway tracks. This conclusion is based on the visual alignment of the locomotive along the track lines that are visible, indicating central placement.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train maintains its structural integrity with the white locomotive and the loaded freight car above it still visible and structurally sound. This conclusion is drawn from the unchanged shape and composition of the train.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the railroad signal on the left, marked with the number '3', is present. The conclusion is based on the visible structure of the signal even under the darker, star-lit background conditions.",
