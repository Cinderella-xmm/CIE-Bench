      "question": "Does the image retain the brown and white pattern characteristic of a giraffe on the nesting dolls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls exhibit a pattern that is highly reminiscent of a giraffe's spots, which are typically brown against a lighter, almost white background. This pattern is characteristic of a giraffe’s skin and is present on the nesting dolls.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the ossicones visible on the heads of the nesting dolls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls have small protrusions on the top of their heads that resemble ossicones, which are the horn-like structures found on a giraffe’s head. These features are consistent with the depiction of giraffes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the nesting dolls have elongated necks resembling those of giraffes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the largest nesting doll is shown with an elongated neck that is longer than normal for a typical nesting doll, reflecting the long neck of a giraffe. However, the smaller dolls have shorter necks compared to the largest one but still longer than typical nesting dolls.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are clearly arranged from the largest on the left to the smallest on the right. This arrangement is typical for nesting dolls, where each successive doll fits inside the previous one.",

    {

      "question": "Do the nesting dolls have long legs resembling those of a giraffe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls do not have any legs visible at all. They are designed in the traditional style of nesting dolls, which typically feature a solid base without separate leg components. Thus, they do not resemble giraffe legs.",
