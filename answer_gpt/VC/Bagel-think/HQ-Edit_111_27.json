      "question": "Is the geisha’s hair styled in an elaborate updo with multiple golden hairpins, floral ornaments, and dangling tassels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the stained glass style suggests a simple representation of objects. The hair is depicted in an updo, common in geisha styling, and there are decorative elements like red flowers and hairpieces represented by noticeable outlines, matching typical kimono era hairpieces. The original image likely had a more detailed depiction. Using world knowledge, a stained glass representation would imply an awareness of the original styling concepts, including such ornaments.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the geisha have a white-painted face with red lips and darkened eye makeup?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the usage of stained glass style means facial features are exaggerated or simplified. The face is mostly white, matching the traditional makeup style. Additionally, the inclusion of red lips and dark features in this contrast-heavy art form fits with geisha makeup. Image A reflects this traditional coloring which Image B simplifies through color choices common in stained glass.",

      "question": "Is the fan held in the geisha’s left hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fan is clearly visible in front of the figure, with the details indicating it is held in the direction that would be equivalent to the figure's left hand when positioned facing right. In Image A, this hand is on the right side of the view, corresponding with the left hand of the figure due to its pose.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the cherry blossoms arranged in an arching pattern above and below the geisha?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, cherry blossoms move from the top to the bottom in an arch-like manner. Image B uses red stained glass shapes to convey an overhead arc and a curved pattern crossing the geisha. In traditional representation and art, cherry blossoms often make a sweeping, cascading effect, echoed here in stained glass interpretation.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a large red bow tied at the back of the kimono?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a large bow at the back of the clothing, a classic element of geisha attire. The color red is evident, signaling the bow's presence. Image A emphasizes this with traditional detail, which Image B captures through bold outlines and color blocks indicating the bow's prominent placement.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geisha's position indicates a traditional profile view, with the silhouette facing right. Although specific facial details are simplified, the profile stance and body-facing direction echo the original pose from Image A, which also suggests this positioning.",
