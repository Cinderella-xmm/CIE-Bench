        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is shown with a black and white striped pattern, which is characteristic of the actual animal it represents. Although it is depicted in a more stylized, cartoonish form, it visually retains this defining feature. The stripes are typical of zebra patterns, known for their alternating black and white contrast, which remain consistent in both the original and edited images.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake is shown with a zebra-striped design, similar to what is present in Image A. Image B features a cake with alternating black and white stripes, which is consistent with the theme of a zebra-striped design. Comparing this with Image A, the cake retains the same unique zebra-striped aesthetic.",

      "question": "Is the zebra still leaning forward toward the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra, albeit depicted in a more stylized manner with a cartoonish perspective, appears to be positioned in a way that suggests leaning towards the cake. This is a continuation of the positioning seen in Image A, where the zebra is visibly leaning towards the cake.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake clearly features a single lit candle on top, as evidenced by the visible flame. This is consistent with the depiction in Image A, where the cake also has a single lit candle. The presence of one lit candle is a common feature that is used to indicate celebration, such as a birthday.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake is shown placed on what appears to be a flat surface consistent with a table, which mirrors the placement observed in Image A. The presence of the table or horizontal flat surface is implied by the consistent alignment of the cake and other elements relative to the base they rest on in both images.",
