    "Question": "Q1: Does the bandage retain its rounded rectangular shape?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the object is a Funko Pop-style figure, not a bandage. Its shape features a rounded head and a blocky body rather than resembling a bandage. Therefore, the object in Image B does not match the typical shape of a rounded rectangular bandage as seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the central adhesive strip still present in the same relative position and size?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure on the case or the toy does not match the central adhesive strip found on a bandage. The design elements on the figure are decorative and do not serve a functional adhesive purpose. In Image A, the central strip is visible and serves an adhesive function on the bandage. The absence of a functional adhesive strip in Image B means it does not match Image A in position or size.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the bandage retain its visible fabric texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the toy figure does not exhibit the texture typical of a bandage. The surfaces are smooth and stylized, representing a vinyl toy, unlike the fabric texture present in Image A. The bandage in Image A shows a textured, fabric-like surface which is not the case in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the bandage's overall proportions consistent with the original image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the overall proportions are of a stylized toy figure and not a bandage. The original bandage in Image A is elongated and thin, fitting the contour of a bandage, while the figure in Image B is hefty with different proportions, typical of Funko Pop figures. Thus, the proportions between the two images do not align.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a shadow cast by the bandage, contributing to its three-dimensional appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure does not cast a shadow typical of a bandage. The packaging and the design of the toy do not present the same lighting conditions as the bandage in Image A. In Image A, the bandage has distinct lighting highlighting its three-dimensional form with shadows, which is not replicated in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
