    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the original woman’s facial features, including the shape of her eyes, nose, mouth, and jawline?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s face is blurred, so the distinct facial features such as the shape of her eyes, nose, mouth, and jawline are not visible. Facial recognition is not possible due to the imposed blur effect, making it impossible to determine whether these features are retained.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the original woman’s skin tone preserved in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In Image A, the visible skin tone on the legs and hands is light. In Image B, the visible skin tones on exposed regions appear consistent with the first image's skin tone, suggesting that the tone is maintained. By observing the hands and any exposed parts of the body, one can determine consistency in skin tone.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the edited image preserve the walking posture with the left leg forward and the right arm bent?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is standing still, holding a fan with both hands. There is no motion suggesting walking, and the position of the arms is different from those in a walking pose. This indicates that the walking posture from Image A is not preserved in Image B.",

    "Question": "Q4: Are the hand positions preserved, with the right hand extended forward and the left hand near the hip?",
