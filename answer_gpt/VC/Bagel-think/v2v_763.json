    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the number \"18\" clearly visible on the back of the player's jersey?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are depicted as chibi-style figurines. The jersey of the character on the left shows a letter, possibly incorporating 'B', but it doesn't clearly indicate '18' as it does in Image A on the player's back.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the number \"18\" visible on the front left side of the player's jersey?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows a chibi character with a letter 'B' on the front of the jersey, rather than a full number like '18'. In comparison, Image A has '18' prominently on the front left side of the jersey.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the player wearing a purple jersey and a purple cap with a black brim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character on the left has a purple jersey and a purple cap, consistent with the real-life depiction in Image A. However, black brims are difficult to discern in the small chibi style, though likely intended.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the player's hands covered with white batting gloves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both chibi characters lack discernable fingers and gloves owing to their stylized form, unlike Image A, which shows the player wearing white batting gloves.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the player holding a black baseball bat with both hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the now-stylized representation means no clear bat hold is visible, it depicts a similar action with possible implied bat holding as seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a white baseball with red stitching visible in the air, approaching the bat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any visible baseball, whereas Image A shows a ball in motion towards the player.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the player in a crouched batting stance with knees bent and torso twisted forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi character is shown in an interaction rather than a batting stance, lacking the realistic detail seen in Image A where the player is crouched and ready to bat.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are both hands gripping the bat near the handle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lack of clear bat depiction in the chibi style makes this indistinct, while Image A shows the player gripping the bat near its handle comfortably.",
