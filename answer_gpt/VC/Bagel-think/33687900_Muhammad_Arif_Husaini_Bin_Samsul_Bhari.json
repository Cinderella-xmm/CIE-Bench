      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B retains the moss-covered rock formation visible at the top of the waterfall’s origin point as seen in Image A. The detailed rock texture and moss presence highlight the natural waterfall setting, remaining consistent across both images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dense tropical vegetation continues to be visible on both sides of the waterfall in Image B, forming a natural frame around the scene just as in Image A. This suggests that the edits focused primarily on the central waterfall element while preserving the lush surroundings, providing depth and context.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pool area at the waterfall's base remains in the same location, though its appearance has been modified with additional elements. The positional consistency of the pool area indicates that the change is centered around aesthetic modifications rather than relocating any geographical features.",
