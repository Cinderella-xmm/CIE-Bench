      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible light source coming from the left, casting shadows on the stone floor and walls of the archway. This creates strong and well-defined shadows, typical of direct sunlight or a strong directional artificial light, matching the setup in Image A. Both images have pronounced shadows, indicating a similar lighting intensity and direction. Therefore, the original lighting style, placement, and intensity of shadows from Image A is preserved in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no chest of drawers or any items atop such furniture visible because Image B features a stone archway with a wooden door, contrasting sharply with the indoor scene in Image A, which includes a chest of drawers with potted plants and books. The setup and arrangement of items on the chest of drawers in Image A are missing in Image B, indicating a different arrangement and setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stone surface leading to a wooden door, characteristic of a medieval or rustic architectural style. The floor is comprised of large stone slabs, consistent with the overall stone architecture. Image A, however, features wooden parquet flooring, which is clearly absent in Image B. This signifies that the parquet flooring texture from Image A is not present in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible furniture serving as a storage unit. The image focuses on an architectural feature - a stone archway and a wooden door. In Image A, the prominent storage feature is a wooden chest of drawers. Since Image B has no such furniture or equivalent object serving as storage, it lacks a primary storage unit.",

      "question": "Is natural light still illuminating the scene from the same direction as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B have strong directional lighting coming from the left side of the scene. In Image A, this natural light floods the room from the left, casting clear shadows on the floor and wall. Similarly, Image B shows sunlight illuminating the stone floor and walls from the left, indicating sunlight directionality is preserved. Therefore, natural light illuminates both scenes from a similar direction.",
