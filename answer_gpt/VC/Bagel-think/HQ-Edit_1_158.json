        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the details of the woman's hair are represented with simplified black outlines typical of a sketch style. This doesn't provide color or detailed hairstyling information as seen in a photograph. Thus, the hair in this representation cannot be evaluated for its color or style due to its lack of details.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the woman's hands are depicted as part of the simplified line drawing, showing both hands on the book. The placement of the hands suggests she is holding the book, but specific details like fingers wrapped around the edges cannot be verified due to the abstract style.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
