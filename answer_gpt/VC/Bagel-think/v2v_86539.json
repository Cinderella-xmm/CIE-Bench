      "question": "Do the characters retain their potato-like shape and texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are depicted with round, soft features and a smooth texture, giving them a potato-like appearance. This is consistent with the potato-like shape seen in typical cartoon or chibi designs where characters are simplified and rounded. The overall structure and presentation in Image B support the notion of a potato-like character.",

      "question": "Is the potato character in the first panel still depicted as exercising with dumbbells and wearing a green headband?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character in the first panel is not depicted with dumbbells. Instead, it is seated with crossed arms in front of a vertical structure, wearing a green headband but without showing any indication of exercising. This contrasts with an image of exercising with dumbbells, which would typically involve a character actively holding and possibly lifting weights.",

      "question": "Does the potato character in the second panel remain inside a cardboard box, indicating sleep?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character in the second panel is not shown inside a cardboard box. Instead, it is sitting on what appears to be bedding or a cushion, with an expression that doesn't clearly indicate sleep but rather contemplation or concern. This differs from the imagery of a character sleeping, which would generally show it in a recumbent position inside a box or on bedding with relaxed features.",

      "question": "Is the potato character in the third panel still seated at a table with food items, indicating eating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the third panel depicts the character with crossed arms sitting on a bench without a table in front. This differs from the image of eating, where the presence of a table with food items would be expected. Instead, this depicts waiting or resting with no interaction with food.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all three panels distinctly showing the activities of exercising, sleeping, and eating respectively?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, none of the panels distinctly show the activities of exercising, sleeping, or eating. The first panel does not show exercising as there are no dumbbells; the second panel does not depict sleeping as the character is seated on a cushion; the third panel does not show eating since there is no table or food items. The activities portrayed in the panels do not align with these specific actions.",
