        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each chibi character is depicted with travel-related items such as suitcases or backpacks. This is consistent with travel scenes, where individuals typically carry such luggage. Despite being in chibi form, these items are stylized versions of luggage recognizable due to their typical design elements, like handles and wheels (for suitcases). The presence of these items indicates interaction with travel-related luggage.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi characters are shown wearing outfits that resemble travel attire, including jackets and long pants or jeans.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays chibi characters in postures and actions implying travel activities. Many characters are seen holding or standing near luggage, a common scene in travel contexts like waiting at train stations.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style art effectively conveys specific types of luggage like suitcases and backpacks. Even in a simplified form, features such as the boxy shape of suitcases and the shoulder straps of backpacks make the items easily identifiable. The chibi drawings exaggerate these features for clarity and recognition.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B reduces the complexity of features due to the chibi style, key elements like hair style, clothing colors, and the presence of similar luggage enable recognition of the characters from Image A. The artistic exaggeration in chibi style highlights essential identifying characteristics while omitting unnecessary detail, allowing viewers to connect both images.",
