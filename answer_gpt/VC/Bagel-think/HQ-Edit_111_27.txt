    "Question": "Q1: Is the geisha’s hair styled in an elaborate updo with multiple golden hairpins, floral ornaments, and dangling tassels?",
    "explanation": "Based on Image B, the stained glass style suggests a simple representation of objects. The hair is depicted in an updo, common in geisha styling, and there are decorative elements like red flowers and hairpieces represented by noticeable outlines, matching typical kimono era hairpieces. The original image likely had a more detailed depiction. Using world knowledge, a stained glass representation would imply an awareness of the original styling concepts, including such ornaments.",

    "Question": "Q2: Does the geisha have a white-painted face with red lips and darkened eye makeup?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the usage of stained glass style means facial features are exaggerated or simplified. The face is mostly white, matching the traditional makeup style. Additionally, the inclusion of red lips and dark features in this contrast-heavy art form fits with geisha makeup. Image A reflects this traditional coloring which Image B simplifies through color choices common in stained glass.",

    "Question": "Q4: Are the cherry blossoms arranged in an arching pattern above and below the geisha?",
