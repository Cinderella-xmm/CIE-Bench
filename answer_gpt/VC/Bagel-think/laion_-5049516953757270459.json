      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the overall shape of the food arrangement a perfect heart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the food arrangement is shaped like a heart. A perfect heart shape typically has symmetry and well-defined curves, while the heart in Image B is formed using Lego-like blocks, resulting in a blocky and uneven outline. Based on common knowledge, this arrangement is not a perfect heart due to its jagged, pixelated edges.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the avocado shown as half-cut with the pit cavity visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, what appears to be an avocado is located near the top-center area of the heart. It is depicted as half a piece with what seems to be a recess representing the pit cavity. This is consistent with the visual cues for a half-cut avocado with the pit removed.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the asparagus stalks bundled together with a visible twine-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area representing asparagus is located on the left side of the heart. The blocks resemble stalks of asparagus, and a twine-like structure can be seen encircling them, imitating the way asparagus is often sold in bundles.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries grouped together at the top-left of the heart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top-left region of the heart shape houses block representations of small red, blue, and darker colored pieces that resemble strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries, given their typical colors and shapes. This arrangement mirrors how these fruits are often grouped together in such presentations.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a single red onion positioned near the broccoli and garlic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the right edge near the center, there's a block resembling a red sphere which is representative of a red onion. It's positioned adjacent to a block that looks like garlic and another representing broccoli. The visual cues align with the representation of these vegetables’ known colors and shapes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there at least three white mushrooms grouped together near the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, near the center, there are several light brown to white block structures that represent mushrooms. There appear to be enough clustered together in a way that suggests at least three, mimicking their shape and typical grouping.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a large red bell pepper at the bottom-right of the heart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom-right of Image B's heart, there's a block structure that appears in a long, red form, which aligns well with the general visual characteristics of a red bell pepper. This imitation and its position are consistent with the arrangement’s description.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the background a neutral gray surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B shows a plain, even color without texture or patterns, consistent with a neutral gray surface. By visual examination and understanding that a neutral gray is achieved by the absence of colorful distractions, Image B fits this description.",
