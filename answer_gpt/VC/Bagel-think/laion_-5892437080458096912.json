    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the subject's face, including the almond-shaped eyes, straight nose, and closed mouth with red lips, preserved in the same position and form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the face lacks details, and no facial features such as almond-shaped eyes, a straight nose, or red lips are discernible. The editing has blurred or obscured these elements, making them unrecognizable. Therefore, the position and form as described cannot be verified.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the subject’s hair color (reddish-brown) and tightly curled, rounded hairstyle preserved exactly as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject retains the reddish-brown hair color and a tightly curled hairstyle, appearing consistent with a rounded shape similar to Image A, despite the context change in clothing and background. This suggests preservation of the hairstyle and color.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the jeweled headpiece with a single dangling pendant at the center of the forehead preserved in the same location and form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject still has a jeweled headpiece with a single dangling pendant at the center of the forehead. The position and form of the headpiece appear to be consistent with what can be observed in Image A.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the right hand positioned on a decorative object (such as a hilt) and the left hand resting on the lap, maintaining the same relative placement and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right hand is positioned on the hip instead of a decorative object, and the left hand seems to maintain a similar orientation, but not on a lap. The relative placement has been altered significantly from Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the subject’s skin tone (pale with subtle rosy blush on the cheeks) preserved without significant alteration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's skin tone appears pale with a slightly different context due to the complete background change. However, without discernible facial features, the original subtle rosy blush on the cheeks can't be confirmed. The visible areas do suggest a maintained skin tone shade.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject maintains a forward-facing and upright symmetrical posture consistent with Image A, which indicates no significant change in the posture.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions seem consistent with a natural representation, similar to those observed in Image A. The head-to-body ratio, arm length, and torso width appear to be preserved without noticeable distortion or exaggeration.",
