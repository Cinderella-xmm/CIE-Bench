      "question": "Is the character's spiky blonde hair present and maintaining its original shape and golden-yellow color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character has spiky hair depicted in a chibi art style. The hair appears as a brighter yellow or potentially golden tone, common for representing blonde hair in such stylized art forms. The shape of the hair is spiky, consistent with the typical styling in related animations. Hence, combining the visual cues with knowledge of character designs, the character's spiky blonde hair is present and maintains its original color.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there exactly three black whisker marks on each cheek of the character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, even though there is a chibi representation, the cheek area of the character is visible with exaggerated features. The stylistic simplifications may not reflect all details like whisker marks, which are canonical for the character in its usual depiction. Therefore, based on typical chibi representation and since the whisker marks are not visible, it suggests a deviation from the expected three black whisker marks.",

      "question": "Is the Konoha forehead protector visible with the spiral symbol clearly engraved on the metal plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the character with the headband generally associated with the Konoha forehead protector. However, due to the exaggerated style of chibi art, the detailing of the engraved spiral symbol on the metal plate is not apparent. Thus, the character wears a stylized forehead protector, distinct from the detailed original representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the blue energy blast originating from the character’s right hand, which is extended forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character is shown with blue energy surrounding it. The miniature arms are not depicted in a detailed extended pose commonly necessary to illustrate the direction of energy blasts clearly. Therefore, while a blue energy effect exists, the pose and depiction imply it doesn’t originate from an explicit forward extension of the character's right hand.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the dominant color of the energy blast electric blue, consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stylized representation in Image B shows energy effects in a tone primarily consistent with electric blue. This visually aligns with the common portrayal of energy in related media. Based on color perception and stylistic characteristics in the genre, the dominant color of the energy blast remains electric blue, consistent with the familiar visual theming.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the character’s eyes appear orange with black pupils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering Image B, the eyes of the chibi character maintain simplified stylistic cues typical of such representation, showing minimal color detail. The emphasis on certain features does not include significant detail of the eyes, and any typical depiction of orange with black pupils isn't visible, suggesting an absence of those specific eye colors.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the character wearing an orange and black outfit with circular patterns visible on the collar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is seen in a highly stylized form characteristic of chibi artistic approaches. The outfit displays elements resembling orange and black; however, the detail, especially the intricate circular patterns on the collar, is not specified or emphasized. This implies the chibi art style has simplified or omitted the pattern found in a more detailed illustration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Does the energy blast extend from the character’s right hand toward the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visualization in Image B depicts an encompassing energy form around the character. Due to the exaggerated and non-specific posing usual in chibi art, the directional specificity of an energy blast extending from the right hand toward the left isn’t distinctly expressed. Instead, the energy appears more as a surrounding aura rather than a directed attack.",
