      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the panda is depicted as an animated or cartoonish character on a card with a distinct black-and-white fur pattern, typical of a panda. This fur pattern is visually consistent with the characteristic appearance of pandas, which are known for their black patches around the eyes and ears contrasting against a white body.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the panda character is holding a staff that has a glowing part at the end, which is evident from the bright, radiant effect depicted artistically. This suggests that the staff has a luminescent or magical quality.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background of the card does not display any explicit banner with the word 'HARMONY'. Instead, the top part of the card has the word 'RAMMONY', which appears more like a title or heading. Therefore, the distinct word 'HARMONY' as a banner is not present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the panda character seated on a white horse, in a manner consistent with being mounted for riding. The positioning and size imply the panda is indeed depicted as riding the horse, which fits the general visual context of similar fantasy or character illustrations.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the panda is dressed in an outfit that resembles a robe. The clothing includes a section that forms a hood over the head, which is typical of a robe with a hooded design. This matches common depictions of mystical or monk-like characters in art, emphasizing the hood's general shape.",
