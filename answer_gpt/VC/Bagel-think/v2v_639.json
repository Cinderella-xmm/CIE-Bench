      "question": "Does the giraffe retain its distinctive brown patches outlined in cream?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffe's appearance is clearly visible despite being represented as a toy figure. It retains the familiar pattern of brown patches surrounded by a lighter cream color, which is characteristic of giraffes. This pattern is consistent with general knowledge about giraffes' markings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the person depicted with extended hands toward the giraffe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person is depicted as a toy figure, and the pose does not show the hands extended toward the giraffe. Instead, the figure has arms facing downward or in a neutral position along the body's side. This contrasts with Image A, where the person is captured with hands gesturing towards the giraffe.",

      "question": "Are the person and giraffe positioned close together, maintaining their original relative distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the person and giraffe as toy figures encased within a display. They are positioned closely together, implying a maintained relative distance similar to Image A. In both images, the pair is depicted standing side by side, denoting a proximate relationship.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The giraffe figure in Image B, although a toy representation, retains the long neck characteristic, which is an essential anatomical trait of giraffes. This aligns with common knowledge of giraffes' distinctive long-neck feature observed in Image A.",
      "weight": 3,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toy figure of the person wears a uniform that is clearly depicted in light blue, consistent with Image A, where the person's attire is light blue as well. This visual cue aligns with the standard color representation for certain uniforms and outfits.",
