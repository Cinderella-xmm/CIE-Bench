      "question": "Are the dark wooden beams forming geometric patterns on the facades of the buildings clearly visible and structurally accurate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dark wooden beams are clearly visible as they create geometric patterns typical of traditional half-timbered architecture, often seen in European settings. The detail in the beams gives a strong sense of structural accuracy, consistent with the architectural style they represent. This reflects a common design in traditional buildings where wooden beams are not just decorative but also structurally integral.",

      "question": "Do the buildings feature steeply pitched gabled roofs with dormer windows positioned at regular intervals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings are small depictions within a snow globe, and they feature steeply pitched roofs typical of European towns. However, there is a lack of specific dormer windows visible within the limitations of a miniature depiction. The presence of steeply pitched roofs is noted, but the regular intervals of dormer windows is inconclusive due to the model's scale.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a pedestrian bridge spanning the canal in the mid-ground, connecting the two sides of the street?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), there is a pedestrian bridge that can be clearly seen. It connects two sides over the water feature within the snow globe, allowing figurines to be seen as walking across it. This is a recognizable element in miniature settings to enhance realism.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the canal surface reflect the surrounding buildings and sky with clear, mirror-like fidelity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the representation inside the snow globe does not have a canal that reflects its surroundings in a mirror-like manner. Instead, it focuses more on the depiction of a small water body typical of miniature settings that do not emphasize reflective detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there flower boxes containing green plants visible along the balcony of the large building on the right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the snow globe of Image B, there are no clear flower boxes visible along any balcony. The details in the model emphasize figures and structures rather than botanical elements. The focus of the snow globe is different from a realistic setup, concentrating on building and bridge representations.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are stone bases and metal railings present along the canal edges beneath the buildings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the representation of the canal edges does not include detailed stone bases or metal railings as it is a miniature snow globe representation, primarily showing buildings, a bridge, and figurines without those specific features.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the windows arranged in vertical and horizontal lines on the facades, matching the timber frame divisions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the windows are arranged in a manner consistent with traditional half-timbered European architecture. The windows in the snow globe match the divisions made by the timber frame, showing alignment in vertical and horizontal lines, which maintains the structural representation seen in typical architecture.",
