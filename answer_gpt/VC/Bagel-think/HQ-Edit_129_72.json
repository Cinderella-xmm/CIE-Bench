      "question": "Is the bird positioned in a side-facing profile, facing left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is a phoenix with its head turned to the right, forming a side profile that faces right. Although the main body is shown in a vibrant display of fiery colors, the head orientation is distinctly facing right. This is evident from the direction of the beak and the eye visibility. When comparing with Image A, the cardinal bird is facing left. Hence, the bird in Image B does not face left.",

      "question": "Are the birdâ€™s feet visibly gripping the branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feet of the phoenix are clearly wrapped around the branch, indicating a gripping action. The visible talons and position on the branch suggest it is gripping firmly. Comparing with Image A, where the cardinal also grips the branch, the feature is consistent between the two images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the main branch extend diagonally from the lower-left to the upper-right of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main branch starts from the lower-left of the frame and extends diagonally towards the upper-right. This trajectory is clear from the anchoring of the branch at the lower section and its extension across the image. Image A also shares this characteristic with the branch following a similar path.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there multiple clusters of blossoms distributed along the side branches of the main twig?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows several clusters of fiery blossoms distributed along the canvas, particularly on the side branches that jut upwards and downwards from the main branch. These indicate multiple groupings. In Image A, clusters of blossoms are similarly positioned along the branches. The presence of blossoms in Image B correlates with common depictions of a phoenix's mythic environment.",

      "question": "Are white snowflakes visible falling throughout the sky background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is dotted with white particles resembling snowflakes, which are scattered throughout the entire background. These elements give a visual impression of falling snow against the clear background, much like those in Image A, where snow is also visually apparent.",

      "question": "Is the background a uniform pale blue sky without clouds or gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B reveals a pale blue coloration with no signs of clouds or color gradients, suggesting a uniform color throughout. This consistent tone in the sky mirrors that of Image A, where the sky also appears to be a uniform blue.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the bird located near the center of the image, with blossoms appearing on both the left and right sides of the branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the phoenix is positioned slightly to the right of the center, with fiery blossoms flanking both sides, especially to the left of the bird's body. In Image A, the bright cardinal bird is centrally located, with visible blossoms on both sides along the branch. Therefore, in Image B, the bird isn't directly centered, although blossoms appear on both sides but are more towards one side.",
