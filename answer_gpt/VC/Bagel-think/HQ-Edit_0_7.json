      "question": "Is the parrot's head and chest covered in bright red feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parrot is modeled as a small figure inside a glass dome. The parrot's head and chest are depicted in a bright red color, typical for certain parrot species known for vibrant colors. The use of red on these parts aligns with a common representation of parrots, suggesting a yes. Considering this, the answer is yes because it corresponds with the expected colorful depiction of a parrot, specifically its head and chest.",

      "question": "Do the parrot's wings display a combination of blue, green, and yellow feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parrot inside the dome features wings painted with blue, green, and yellow. These colors are characteristic of certain colorful parrot species, aligning with their naturally vibrant feather patterns. Such a display of colors suggests the vibrant and exotic imagery often associated with parrots, leading to a yes answer. This is consistent with typical parrot wing colorings.",

      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the parrot have a long tail with distinct red, blue, and yellow striped feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parrot's tail does not have distinct red, blue, and yellow striped feathers. Instead, it features a small, monocolor tail inside the glass dome. The simplified design of toys or models can sometimes omit complex patterns, so the representation in Image B is consistent with simpler parrot toys or models. As a result, the answer is no since the image does not show a long tail with such distinctive striping.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the parrot have a large, curved beak with a pale gray upper part and black lower part?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parrot figure inside the dome has a beak that is large and curved, typical of parrot anatomy. However, the beak's colors in the image are slightly stylized, focusing primarily on the cartoonish representation rather than exact coloration. This can include variations from authentic colorations, yet it aligns well with expectations of a parrot's large, curved beak. Although the colors aren't detailed as pale gray and black, the essential form and size deliver a yes answer for this question.",

      "question": "Is the parrot positioned upright on a branch with its head turned toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parrot is positioned upright on a branch within the dome, gazing forward with its head turned slightly toward the viewer, which is typical of toy representations or models meant to appear 'animated' or engaged with the viewer. This representation conveys an upright posture typical of a perched parrot. Therefore, the position of the parrot provides a yes answer.",

      "question": "Is the parrot perched on a branch covered in green moss?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parrot is depicted perched on a branch in the dome, which supports ideal positioning for the parrot, but there's no visible green moss coverage. Instead, the branch in the depiction is relatively simple and devoid of textural details like moss that could be seen in Image A. Given the lack of moss depiction, the answer is no.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there large, vibrant green leaves encircling the parrot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, inside the dome, there is a backdrop with large leaves surrounding the small parrot figure, adding to the enclosed naturalistic scene. These leaves are green and emphasize the environment's liveliness. The depiction of green leaves to create a natural setting around the figure signifies a yes answer.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Does the parrot have a yellow eye with a dark pupil and white facial skin surrounding it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the parrot is a small figure inside a dome, the eye details are semi-simplified but observe traditional coloring. The use of a black pupil within the eye and contrasting facial skin color signifies a recognition of typical avian features despite the stylized nature of the representation, resulting in a yes answer.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the branch the parrot perches on doesn't show textured moss. The simplicity of the display means decorative or textured elements such as moss are not present, contrary to what might be in more detailed natural imagery. Therefore, the representation in Image B gives a no, as textured moss is absent.",
