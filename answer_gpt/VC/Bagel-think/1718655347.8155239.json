      "question": "Is there a large, circular, reddish celestial body located in the upper left portion of the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, there is a large, circular, reddish celestial body in the sky. This body is prominently positioned above the mountains and is distinctly colored with shades of red, indicating a representation of a moon or similar celestial object. The circular shape and color are characteristic features often associated with moons or planets during sunset, eclipse, or artistic depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a prominent mountain range with snow-covered peaks spanning the background behind the lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a stylized representation of a mountain range with peaks. The shapes of the peaks are angular and abstract, suggesting snow cover or glacial features through the use of geometric patterns colored in white. Despite the artistic style, the essence of a mountain range in the background is captured, consistent with typical portrayals of snow-capped mountains.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a large, reflective body of water occupying the central foreground of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a large body of water that dominates the central foreground. The use of flowing lines and shading suggests it represents a lake or river. Reflection is implied through the use of color gradients, which are typical of water's reflective surfaces in artistic renderings.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there clusters of red-colored trees lining both banks of the lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The banks of the lake in Image B feature shapes and patterns styled in red, which signify trees. These tree-like forms are positioned along both sides, mirroring the usual layout of trees lining a body of water. The color red is prominently used, creating a thematic alignment with the celestial body and enhancing environmental contrast.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the surface of the lake reflect the red moon and the snow-capped mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the use of colors and flowing lines in the water suggests reflection, a common attribute of calm water surfaces. The lake reflects the overall color scheme without specific details of the moon or mountains. The image's abstract style might imply reflection, but there are no direct distinct reflections of these elements.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible rocks and patches of snow along the lakeâ€™s edge in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain visible representations of rocks or patches of snow along the lake's edge in the foreground. The foreground uses stylized elements and patterns, primarily in red and blue tones, suggesting natural features, but lacks any clear depiction resembling rocks or snow.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the moon positioned above the mountain range and the lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The circular reddish object resembling a moon in Image B is positioned at the top of the composition, above both the mountain range and the depiction of the lake. This placement effectively follows common artistic conventions for celestial objects like the moon in landscape artworks.",
