      "question": "Are the two cylindrical corner towers still present at the left and right ends of the castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the castle within the snow globe shows cylindrical corner towers, which are common in traditional castle architecture as defensive structures. The visual indicates the towers on either end of the facade, consistent with typical design cues of castles. Image A also shows cylindrical towers at each corner of the castle, confirming the presence of similar architectural elements.",

      "question": "Do the two central square turrets with pointed finials remain atop the central section of the castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates central square turrets with pointed finials positioned on top of the castle within the snow globe. These structures are often seen in castle designs for aesthetic and defensive purposes. Comparing Image A, these turrets with finials are indeed present, revealing consistency in the architecture of the castle.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the large central arched entranceway still present and centrally aligned with the pathway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entrance of the castle depicted within the snow globe is visually aligned with the pathway that leads to it, indicating symmetry in design. Image A features a large central arched entranceway that is centrally aligned with the pathway, thus the design principle remains unchanged.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the arched windows and openings arranged symmetrically across the front facade of the castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe castle displays a series of arched windows evenly positioned, suggesting symmetry, which is a common architectural aspect found in castle designs. Image A reveals a similar symmetrical arrangement of arched windows across its facade, underscoring uniformity in design.",

      "question": "Is the castle still constructed from dark gray and reddish-brown stone blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's castle within the snow globe appears to be designed with a solid color palette, focusing on illustrative rather than realistic stone textures. Contrasting Image A, the castle is made of visibly distinguishable dark gray and reddish-brown stone blocks typical of historical architecture, suggesting a shift from realistic material representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the upper portion of the castle still open to the sky, revealing the lack of a roof and internal framework?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the castle within a snow globe, symbolizing a whimsical, fantastical approach where structural details like the absence of a roof might be minimized. Image A, however, depicts a ruin with open upper sections exposing the sky, indicative of a lack of a roof and internal framework, highlighting the transformation from ruin to complete structure through editing.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the castle within the snow globe is crafted so that its entrance is centrally aligned with an illustrative pathway that guides the viewer's eye, aligning with typical design symmetry. Image A presents the arched entranceway directly in line with the pathway leading to it, showing consistency in design alignment and balancing composition.",
