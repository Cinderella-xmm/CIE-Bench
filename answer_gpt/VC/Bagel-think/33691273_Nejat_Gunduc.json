    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the Coca-Cola bottle present in the advertisement with its distinctive curved shape and visible partial logo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited comic-style depiction shows text resembling 'Coca-Cola' in bubble letters, but there's no distinct curved-shaped bottle visible as seen traditionally in real-life advertisements. The emphasis is on lettering alone, barring a direct portrayal of a bottle.",
      "weight": 3,

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the white earbud visible in the woman’s ear with the wire extending downward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to its stylized and abstract comic design, no specific details regarding earbuds or wires are visible. Instead, the focus is on visual dialogue and layout.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are shown in a comic strip depiction. However, the positioning is ambiguous and fragmented due to the abstract styling of the figures, not emphasizing realistic profiles or directionality.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the man’s right hand positioned near his ear, holding the earbud in a manner that mimics the woman’s use?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the comic-style artwork does not depict realistic human actions or accessories such as earbuds. Thus, no hand positioning or interaction with earbuds is visible.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top-right corner does not exhibit signs of a tear or peel. The graphical elements and decorations typical of a comic style maintain intact borders.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the man positioned in front of the advertisement, partially overlapping it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the comic art suggests a stylistic narrative scene without three-dimensional overlap. The separation between different components does not illustrate the man being placed in front in a layered manner.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the text 'Coca-Cola' appears prominently as part of the comic's textual stylings, it's not printed on any bottle or visible in association with any physical objects, as no definitive bottle is illustrated.",
