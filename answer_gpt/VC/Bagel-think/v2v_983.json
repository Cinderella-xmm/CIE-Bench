      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the tan and black fur color distribution, particularly the tan face and legs with black back, preserved in the creature’s design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature exhibits a color palette which mirrors the color distribution of tan and black seen in Image A. The face and legs of the creature are primarily tan, while the back is predominantly black. This design choice replicates the original dog's distinctive fur pattern. Therefore, based on the examination of these visual elements, we can confirm the preservation of tan and black fur color distribution.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floppy ears, with their rounded shape and downward angle, preserved in the creature’s head design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature features ears that are rounded and flop downwards, aligning with the original dog's characteristic ear shape and orientation seen in Image A. This consistency indicates the preservation of the floppy ear design.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the open mouth with a visible pink tongue and exposed teeth preserved in the creature’s facial expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B is illustrated with an open mouth, exhibiting a pink tongue and exposed teeth, which mirrors the facial expression and mouth features of the dog in Image A. This continuity in design captures the original expression and detail.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the blue collar with a black buckle present on the creature, either as part of its design or reflected in the orb’s color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B has a blue collar, highlighted with a central circular embellishment. This corresponds with the blue collar and black buckle of the original dog in Image A, thereby preserving this element in the creature's design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the creature in a seated position with its front paws forward, similar to the lying down posture of the dog in Image A. While not exactly the same pose, the extension of the front paws is similar enough to be considered a mirrored aspect of the original posture.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the creature with dark eyes, a dark nose, and a tan muzzle, closely resembling the facial features of the dog in Image A. These elements are effectively preserved in the creature's design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the creature retain the medium-sized, muscular body proportions of the original dog, including a broad chest and defined back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature depicted in Image B has a more stylized, cartoon-like appearance, which simplifies the proportions compared to the realistic medium-sized, muscular body seen in Image A. Thus, the creature does not proportionally match the body characteristics of the original dog.",
