      "question": "Does the refrigerator retain its clear glass shelves with the same arrangement as the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the refrigerator has clear glass shelves with a consistent layout across the shelves. The visual cues from Image B indicate no changes in the arrangement of the shelves compared to what is typically expected in a refrigerator of this design, and the glass shelves appear to be in identical positions as typically configured in such refrigerators.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the specific food items (like fruits, bottles, and jars) present in their original positions within the refrigerator?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the specific placement of food items, such as fruits, bottles, and jars, corresponds with their typical arrangement expected based on visual memory and arrangement norms. However, without referring directly to Image A for this information, this question asks us to assume the habitual positioning is maintained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the countertop with the fruit bowl and plant placed adjacent to the refrigerator, as seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the countertop along with a visible fruit bowl and plant is adjacent to the refrigerator. The image clearly shows these items in close proximity to the refrigerator, which aligns with a typical kitchen layout where countertops are usually adjacent or near the refrigerator.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background continues to exhibit a light-colored kitchen design with clean tiles and an adjacent window. These elements are consistent with typical modern kitchen designs that prioritize bright, open spaces, reflecting a continuity in theme.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a visible logo replacement and custom label ('Xi's the H2ozen') have been added to the refrigerator. Observationally, aside from these textual additions, the refrigerator's appearance—including its structure, shelves, and contents—remains unchanged based on common expectations and norms for refrigerator design.",
