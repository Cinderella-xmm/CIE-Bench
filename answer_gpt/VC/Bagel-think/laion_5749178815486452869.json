      "question": "Does the open umbrella retain its circular canopy shape with visible radial ribs converging at a central hub?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the open umbrella maintains a circular canopy shape. The central hub is evident as the focal point where radial ribs converge, indicating the structure of an umbrella from a top-down view. The circular shape and converging ribs are characteristic of an umbrella canopy, and this structure is clearly visible in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the closed umbrella present with a black casing, wrist strap, and metallic tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a closed umbrella with a black casing, which is the typical casing color for umbrellas. Additionally, it has a wrist strap visible at one end and a metallic tip, which are common features for handheld umbrellas. These features are easily identifiable in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the starlit sky with visible stars and nebulae still present as the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background designed to resemble a starlit sky with visible stars and nebulae. The sky composition, with bright points akin to stars and patterns typical of nebulae, suggests an astronomical setting for the background, which remains consistent between both images.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the scene composed with flowers in the foreground, a hill in the midground, and the sky in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a composition where flowers are clearly visible in the foreground, a grassy hill occupies the midground, and a starlit sky forms the background. This layering is apparent, as the layout provides a multi-dimensional scene stretching from near to distant visual elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the black support ribs visible and extending from the central hub to the edge of the canopy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, black support ribs are visible extending from the central hub towards the edge of the umbrella canopy. These ribs provide structural integrity to the umbrella and are crucial features for its function. They are clearly shown in the image, similar to their presence in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the visual of yellow coneflowers and red poppies in the foreground, indicating a floral scene. These specific flower types are visible and match the typical colors—yellow and red—associated with coneflowers and poppies, respectively.",
