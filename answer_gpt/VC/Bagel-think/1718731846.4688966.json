      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the vertical facial split between black and white fur still present, dividing the face precisely down the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden dog sculpture features a similarly designed horizontal split that runs vertically down the center of its face, separating it into distinct black and white sections. This characteristic is reminiscent of chibi-style depictions common in cartoons and sculptures, where symmetry enhances aesthetic appeal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both eyes large, round, and positioned symmetrically on either side of the facial split, with visible highlights reflecting light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's eyes are crafted along the same positions but are not large and round like those in animated depictions, nor do they have highlights reflecting light. Instead, the sculpture’s carved eyes appear as solid forms without distinct highlights.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the dog maintains an upright sitting posture, where both front paws are positioned firmly on the base, and its hind legs seem tucked beneath its body. This pose is typical in sculptures designed to represent attentive animals.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a centered black nose on the sculpture’s muzzle, maintaining visual balance. Nevertheless, there are no visible whisker lines extending from the wood-crafted snout, as woodcarvers typically focus on larger features rather than intricate detailing.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a collar crafted around the neck of the wooden dog sculpture, adorned with a singular tag. This element mimics the realistic accessories often attributed to pets, even though it's achieved through sculpting rather than actual materials.",
