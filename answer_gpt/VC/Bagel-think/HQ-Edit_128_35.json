      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the curved carriage of the typewriter present and accurately shaped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the typewriter is not visible; instead, there is a book cover with a leather spine. Therefore, any features related to the typewriter's carriage cannot be assessed. Based on world knowledge, a typewriter carriage is part of the upper section of the machine where the paper is held, but since Image B does not depict a typewriter, there is no basis to discuss its carriage.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the round silver key caps arranged in a QWERTY layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a book cover design rather than a typewriter, so the presence and arrangement of typewriter keys cannot be evaluated. A QWERTY layout typically describes the specific arrangement of letters on a keyboard or typewriter, which cannot be observed in a book cover image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the brand name \"Underwood\" visible on the front panel of the typewriter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible typewriter or front panel; the image shows a book cover with the title \"Tales Etncl...\" Therefore, it is impossible to verify the presence of the 'Underwood' brand name, as a typewriter is not depicted.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the radial fan-like pattern beneath the carriage present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The radial fan-like pattern typically refers to the metal arms of a typewriter just below the carriage, which strike the ribbon to transfer ink to the paper. Image B does not depict a typewriter at all, so such a pattern cannot be present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the side knobs and left lever present on the typewriter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of a typewriter, eliminating the possibility of evaluating any such mechanical components like side knobs or levers, which are typically controls for carriage movement on a typewriter.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the typewriter body predominantly glossy black?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks a depiction of a typewriter entirely, presenting instead a book cover. Consequently, there is no visible body to assess for color or glossiness. Typically, typewriters might come in various colors, glossy black being a common one, but without the typewriter, this question is not applicable.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the platen roller visible above the keyboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the absence of a typewriter precludes the possibility of identifying mechanical parts such as the platen roller, a cylindrical element that holds paper against the typebars in a typewriter. Thus, no such feature can be seen.",

      "model_answer": "No",
