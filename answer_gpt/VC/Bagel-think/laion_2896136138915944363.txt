    "Question": "Q2: Is the breast and throat area rendered in a consistent peach-orange hue, distinct from the darker upper body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the breast and throat area of the bird are depicted in a consistent peach-orange color. This hue is distinctly different from the darker browns and mixed tones present on the bird's upper body and wings. The use of a uniform peach-orange in these areas highlights the bird's plumage contrast, which is often seen in illustrations aiming to differentiate body sections.",
    "answer": "Yes"
