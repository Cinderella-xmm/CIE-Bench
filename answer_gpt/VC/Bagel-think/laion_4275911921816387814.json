    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the blade visibly curved in the same manner as in the original image, extending from the guard to a pointed tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blade is still visibly curved, similar to a traditional dagger, with an arc that starts from the guard and continues to the tip. By examining the shape, it mirrors the distinct curve shown in Image A, indicating that the integral shape and extension pattern have been preserved.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the hilt retain the segmented, block-like pattern along its length, similar to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the hilt with a different texture and color. Unlike the original hilt in Image A, which shows a segmented, block-like pattern, Image B's hilt appears smooth and monochromatic. This deviation indicates that the original pattern has not been retained.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the guard decorated with intricate floral and geometric patterns, matching the original design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the guard appears to lack the detailed floral and geometric patterns that are seen in Image A. Instead, it shows a solid color, suggesting that the decorative elements of the original design are not present in the edited image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the blade covered with a dense black filigree pattern, matching the original in layout and coverage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the blade retains the dense black filigree pattern, with a similar layout and coverage as seen in Image A. The patterns closely match, indicating that this aspect of the design has been preserved.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the proportions between the hilt, guard, and blade preserved, with the blade being longer than the hilt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains similar proportions as seen in Image A, where the blade is noticeably longer than the hilt. The overall size relationship between these parts appears consistent with the original proportions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the blade end in a pointed tip, consistent with the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tip of the blade in Image B finishes in a pointed end, consistent with what is observed in Image A. This suggests that the characteristic pointed nature of the blade has been maintained.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the dagger positioned diagonally across the frame, from upper left to lower right, as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dagger in Image B is oriented diagonally, stretching from the upper left to the lower right, mirroring the diagonal position seen in Image A. This suggests that the overall positioning of the object within the frame remains unchanged.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
