      "question": "Is the orange circular logo with the white animal figure clearly visible on the sack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sack shows a logo area that is partially visible, but due to the artistic editing, the visibility and clarity of the logo's details, such as the color and figure, is diminished. There appears to be an interpretation of the logo but not with clear visibility. Comparatively in Image A, the orange circular logo with a white animal figure is clearly visible and discernible. Thus, the description based on Image B lacks clarity.",

      "question": "Is the worker’s right hand visibly reaching into the tea bush to pick leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the position of the worker's hand is evident as it extends into the crop. The stylized depiction shows the hand reaching toward the plants, consistent with a posture for picking leaves. This artistic representation maintains the same hand positioning as Image A, where the hand is visibly reaching into the tea bush.",

      "question": "Is the worker leaning forward with her upper body angled downward toward the tea plants?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited depiction clearly portrays the worker’s posture as leaning forward. The upper body of the worker is angled downward, signifying engagement with the plants consistent with agricultural work. This posture mirrors the original positioning in Image A, where the worker is similarly leaning forward toward the tea plants.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artistic interpretation shows the sack positioned on the left side of the worker’s waist, indicating a hanging position similar to carrying equipment for collecting. This matches the original depiction found in Image A where the sack is properly hanging from the left side of the waist, aiding in gathering leaves.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features stylized rows of tea plants arranged diagonally across the terrain, maintaining the spatial layout visible in Image A. The edited representation retains the distinct diagonal row pattern, reflective of organized agricultural planting practices across the slope.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the worker is depicted wearing a shirt characterized by long sleeves in a vivid artistic manner, interpreted as an olive-green color. This depiction corresponds to the attire in Image A, where the shirt worn by the worker is distinctly olive-green and long-sleeved.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, based on the stylized depiction, the worker’s hair is gathered toward the back resembling a low ponytail style, although being subject to artistic modification. This form resembles Image A, where the hair is styled similarly with dark tones and some loose strands around the face, visible before the face was blurred.",
