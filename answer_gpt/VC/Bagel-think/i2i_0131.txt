    "Question": "Q2: Do both refrigerators retain the double-door design with water/ice dispensers located on the freezer compartments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is only one refrigerator visible instead of two. The single refrigerator shown maintains the double-door design. The water/ice dispenser is correctly located on the left door, which is typically the freezer compartment in a side-by-side refrigerator setup. However, the presence of only one refrigerator instead of two means the answer is 'No' for both retaining a double-door design, as only one is visible.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are the refrigerators displayed in their original proportions and sizes relative to each other, without distortion?",
