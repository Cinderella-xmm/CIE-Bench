      "question": "Is the V-shaped dual-wing silhouette of the building preserved in the edited version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the previously observed V-shaped dual-wing silhouette from Image A appears to have been altered. Image A featured a distinct V-shaped configuration created by the protruding sections of the building's facade. However, in Image B, the presence of additional mechanical structures, resembling gears and pipes on the exterior, changes the overall outline, diminishing the previously noted V-shape. This suggests that the original V-shaped silhouette is no longer preserved in the edited image.",

      "question": "Are the floors stacked in a consistent, repeating modular pattern from bottom to top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In analyzing Image B, the building's structure shows a consistent stacking of floors that exhibit a repeating modular design. This is characterized by similar arrangements of windows and balconies throughout the height of the building, replicating the structure seen in Image A. The mechanical additions present in Image B do not disrupt the basic repeating pattern of the floors.",

      "question": "Are the windows and balconies aligned horizontally on each floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the presence of external mechanical additions, the windows and balconies on each floor retain horizontal alignment, similar to those observed in Image A. They are structured in predictable rows across each level of the building, which suggests that each floor's components maintain horizontal alignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the two wings of the building symmetrically positioned relative to the central vertical axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the building's design showcased two wings symmetrically positioned relative to its central axis, forming a balanced architecture. In Image B, the structural integrity of the wings' positioning relative to the central axis has been visually altered by the addition of mechanical components, which disturb the symmetry observed earlier. Therefore, the symmetry relative to the central vertical axis is compromised in the edited image.",

      "question": "Are the yellow awnings present on the balconies in their original positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When comparing Image B to Image A, the yellow awnings that were originally placed on specific balconies maintain their positions. Despite the added mechanical alterations in Image B, these do not affect the placements of yellow awnings on the displayed balconies, suggesting their consistent presence from the original to edited version.",

      "question": "Is there a visible separation between the window openings and the projecting balcony overhangs on each floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the construction of each floor includes window openings distinctively separated from the projecting balcony overhangs, similar to the layout in Image A. These separations are visually clear and highlight the architectural design maintained in the edited version, despite additional mechanical elements.",
