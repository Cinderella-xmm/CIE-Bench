    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes green in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the analysis of Image B, the eyes incorporated into the character design at the bottom appear stylized and cartoonish with a large black iris typical of a chibi or cartoon rendition which does not specify any particular eye color beyond classic cartoon aesthetics, therefore there's no indication of green coloration.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the lipstick applied in a rich red shade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not provide any visible lips or lipstick application as the face area is blurred out, and the focus is on cartoon eyes. Based on the visual, there's no representation of lipstick color.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the subject looking upward and toward the upper left of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes depicted within Image B are stylized cartoon eyes that standardly face forward, lacking a defined iris directionality which characterizes a direct gaze rather than an upward or directional glance.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the left shoulder bare and visible in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon depiction does not emphasize realistic bodily features, particularly shoulders. The cartoon elements focus primarily on head and face details with a lack of visible shoulders within the blurred segment.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a pinkish, textured material partially visible near the lower left edge of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beneath the blurred section, there are two cartoon clouds with eyes, with the left one being pink in color. This fits with the cue of pinkish material, possibly mimicking the texture of fluffy or plush materials.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there soft highlights on the cheekbones and jawline created by directional lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, featuring stylized cartoon elements, lacks detailed contouring and depth that creates highlights or shadows characteristic of directional lighting, as stylistic elements focus on simplified shapes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the facial features symmetrically aligned with balanced spacing between the eyes, nose, and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face is obscured by a blur, and thus analysis of facial feature alignment or symmetry is not applicable, as the illustration emphasizes other aspects like the stylized eyes and not realistic or symmetrical facial spacing.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
