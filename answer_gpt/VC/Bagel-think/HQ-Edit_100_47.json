      "question": "Is the Eiffel Tower depicted with its characteristic lattice iron framework, including the four arched legs and tapered spire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower is represented in a stylized, sculptural or miniature form, within a shadow box frame. While it maintains the recognizable form of the Eiffel Tower with a general structural shape, the details like the lattice iron framework aren't fully represented in a realistic manner due to the artistic choices. However, the overall structure, including the four legs and tapered spire, is suggested through its form. The depiction is more abstract and does not convey the fine lattice detail of the Eiffel Tower in a realistic sense.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the rectangular reflecting pool positioned directly in front of the Eiffel Tower, aligned along the central axis of the composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a rectangular feature resembling a reflecting pool is visible and is placed directly in front of the model of the Eiffel Tower, along what seems to be the central axis leading towards it. This alignment with the tower suggests a deliberate arrangement in the composition that reflects an intended central axis.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the pathways and tree arrangements in the foreground arranged symmetrically around the central axis leading to the Eiffel Tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pathways and tree arrangements are part of a structured design that is typical of formal gardens. They are positioned in symmetry around the central axis that extends from the viewer's perspective towards the tower, suggestive of an orderly layout. This symmetry is apparent by the repeated forms on either side of the axis and is consistent with the composition of a formal garden leading to a monument.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a distinct spire-shaped building visible in the distance to the left of the Eiffel Tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, there is a structure with a spire-like top visible towards the left of the Eiffel Tower when looking into the distance. This aligns with typical Parisian architecture and gives an impression of a cityscape that includes identifiable elements such as church spires, contributing to the balance of the composition.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sun located in the upper-left portion of the sky, casting light from that direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an object representing the sun located on the left side of the frame. However, this element is depicted more as part of an artistic or symbolic representation rather than a realistic sun casting light. Its position suggests left side placement in the context of the composition yet is more stylized within the art piece.",
