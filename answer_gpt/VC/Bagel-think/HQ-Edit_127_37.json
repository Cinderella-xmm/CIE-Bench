    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the feathered plume still present on top of the knight's helmet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a feathered plume on top of the knight's helmet, as indicated by a small tuft of brown feathers. This is similar to the traditional design in knight helmets historically and visually-significant in knight statuettes or models.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the rampant lion emblem clearly visible on the shield?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shield in Image B features a decorative emblem, but it doesn't resemble a rampant lion. It has a circular floral design instead. Historically, rampant lions symbolize power and nobility, but this isn't reflected in the emblem seen here.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the knight holding a long spear or lance in their right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knight's right hand does not hold a long spear or lance. Instead, the knight is only holding their shield, which indicates that the weapon is absent in this model-like figure.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the knight's pauldrons and greaves visibly present in the armor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The knight in Image B has armor that includes shoulder guards (pauldrons) and lower leg guards (greaves), standard components in a knight's armor suit. This suggests traditional armor representation in collectible miniatures.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the castle's main turret with a conical roof and flagpole still visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the castle's turret is visible with a conical roof, resembling medieval castle architectural designs. However, there is no visible flagpole atop the turret which often symbolizes fortresses.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are strands of ivy hanging down from the top of the archway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no archway present, and thus, no ivy strands can be seen in this model-like transformation of the setting. The absence of organic elements suggests a focus on a more simplified or miniature representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the knight positioned facing toward the right side of the image, with the shield on the left arm?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The knight in Image B stands facing forward, not toward the right, with the shield positioned on the knight's left arm. This depiction is typical in miniature models where elements are simplified and oriented centrally for display.",
