      "question": "Does the dress retain the exact geometric pattern of orange-brown diamonds with spiral centers on a turquoise blue background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress features geometric patterns that align with the description of orange-brown diamonds with spiral centers on a turquoise blue background. The color scheme and pattern shapes are vibrant, consistent with a tribal or traditional motif. Comparing this with Image A, where the same pattern and color scheme are visible, it confirms that the dress does retain the pattern exactly as described.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the beads on the hair arranged in the same repeating sequence of red, white, yellow, and black as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beads on the hair show a colorful and systematic organization. The exact sequence of colors, however, seems altered or more vibrant due to artistic editing effects, which emphasize certain colors more than others. Comparing Image B to Image A, the pattern sequence may appear similar, but the enhanced and more vivid representation could alter the perception of an exact match.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the braids maintain their upward-coiled crown-like structure originating from the scalp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the braids appear to have a vertical orientation and form a structure raised above the scalp, resembling a crown-like arrangement. This structure is consistent with a traditional hairstyle. Image A also shows an upright, coiled arrangement originating from the scalp. Thus, the edited image maintains this overall structure.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the necklace composed of multiple horizontal layers of beads arranged in concentric rings around the neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a necklace highly detailed with multiple layers of beads forming concentric rings around the neck. This layered appearance is consistent with ethnic jewelry styles known for such structures. Image A also depicts multiple beaded layers in concentric rings, supporting the idea that the necklace composition is retained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there multiple stacked bangles present on both wrists, maintaining the original color sequence and positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each wrist features multiple stacked bangles, and while specific colors are vivid, the artistic style affects our ability to compare exact sequences and positioning. Observing Image A, multiple bangles are also present in a systematic arrangement. The coloring may differ slightly due to the editing effect, hence maintaining an identical sequence is uncertain.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the large circular hoop earrings present in the left earlobe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left ear shows an area consistent with the presence of earrings, but due to artistic embellishments, clarity on the exact type of earrings is challenging. When reviewing Image A, there are large hoop earrings visible. Therefore, based on lack of clarity in the edited version, it is uncertain if they are present as in the original.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the girl maintain a smiling expression with direct eye contact and a forward-facing posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face in Image B is blurred, therefore, determining any facial expression or eye contact is not possible. In Image A, the forward-facing posture is observed, though the direct eye contact or smile cannot be critically evaluated in Image B due to the blur.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Does the dress have a sleeveless top and a flared skirt section with vertical pleats?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress's structure can still be discerned as sleeveless and appears to have a flared skirt section, with pleats visible due to the outlines influenced by editing effects. Image A confirms this design, showing a sleeveless attire with a flared bottom. While editing may enhance visual vibrancy, it doesn't alter the basic design.",
