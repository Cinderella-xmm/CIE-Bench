      "question": "Is the cat depicted with fluffy white fur that maintains its distinct texture and coverage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is shown with fluffy white fur that appears dense and well-textured, indicating a healthy coat. The distinctiveness of the fur is emphasized by individual strands and the thickness seen around the neck and body. This is consistent with common characteristics of fluffy-furred cats, where the fur often appears soft and voluminous. Comparing this with Image A, the textural quality and coverage of the fur remain consistent, showing no significant changes in appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the illustration retain the cat's yellow-green eyes with visible pupils reflecting the original appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes of the cat are yellow-green with distinct pupils, which give a lively and alert expression. This is reinforced by the sharp contrast between the pupil and the iris, a common trait in cat illustrations to indicate depth and liveliness. Upon assessing Image A, the cat similarly displays prominent yellow-green eyes, and the edited image retains this characteristic accurately.",

      "question": "Are the cat’s pink inner ears accurately represented in terms of color and shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the cat’s ears with a soft pink hue on the inner side, contrasting with the white outer fur. The shape of the ears, which are triangular and pointed, is a typical anatomical feature in cats. Comparing this to Image A, the inner ear color appears consistent, maintaining the accurate representation of both shape and hue.",

      "question": "Does the illustration preserve the cat’s relaxed posture with extended paws, consistent with its original positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is positioned in a relaxed manner, lying down with its paws extended, which is commonly seen in cats that feel comfortable and at ease. This posture allows for a sense of tranquility and contentment. In comparison to Image A, the posture of the cat remains unchanged, emphasizing the same relaxed and stretched-out form of the paws.",

      "question": "Is the subtle floral pattern on the cushion accurately rendered in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cushion under the cat with a subtle floral pattern that provides a textured appearance. The pattern is intricately designed and becomes a complementary element to the overall scene. A comparison with Image A reveals that the pattern on the cushion appears consistent, retaining its subtlety and intricacy across both images.",
