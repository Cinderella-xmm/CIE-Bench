        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is shown with spiky hair that is colored in bright cyan blue.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main figure is shown wearing a bodysuit colored in a bright cyan (interpreted as blue) with areas that can be visually understood as a chest plate. The design mimics an armored look with sections that are highlighted in yellow, resembling similar characteristics of a chest plate with yellow side panels. Based on common designs for anime armor seen in action figures, this analysis supports the description.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the character's gloves and boots are depicted entirely in white without distinctive separate yellow tips at the fingers and toes, utilizing a simplified color palette in this interpretation. The artistic style or editing might omit some colors, but the description based on details directly visible in Image B leads to the conclusion that the boots and gloves do not feature yellow tips.",
