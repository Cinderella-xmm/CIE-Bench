    "Question": "Q1: Are the black stripes evenly distributed across the body, head, and legs in the same pattern as the original knitted animal?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the animal sculpture features a mosaic design with tile pieces colored orange and black. These tiles create a checkerboard-like pattern rather than evenly distributed stripes like in Image A. The knitted animal in Image A has black stripes running in vertical lines uniformly across its body and legs, which differ from the blocky, tiled pattern on the sculpture in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the snout present with two clearly defined, dark circular nostrils positioned symmetrically on the upper portion of the snout?",
    "explanation": "The mosaic sculpture in Image B does show nostrils on the snout, created using dark tiles that mimic nostrils' appearance. They are symmetrically placed and clearly defined. This closely resembles the stitched nostrils on the original knitted animal in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the eyes large, round, and positioned symmetrically on the face, each consisting of a white outer ring and a central black pupil?",
    "explanation": "The eyes on the mosaic sculpture in Image B are large and round, with each eye surrounded by white space and having a central black pupil made from tiles. They are positioned symmetrically on the face, mirroring the design seen on the original knitted animal in Image A which also has large, round eyes with a similar composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the mouth a clearly visible curved line forming a smile below the snout, consistent with the original animalâ€™s expression?",
    "explanation": "In both images, the animal features a mouth that is stylized as a curved line indicating a smile. In Image B, the mosaic tiles form this curved mouth below the snout clearly, mirroring the expression in Image A, where the mouth is stitched to indicate a smiling expression.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the animal in a walking pose with the left front leg extended forward and the right front leg grounded behind it?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture has legs that are positioned such that they appear static rather than indicating movement. The posture does not show a distinguished walking pose. Image A, on the other hand, shows the knitted animal in motion, with the left front leg extended forward and the right front leg grounded.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there two small, rounded ears positioned symmetrically on top of the head, pointing slightly outward?",
    "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B displays two small, rounded ears positioned symmetrically on top of the head. They appear to point slightly outward. This matches the placement and orientation of ears in Image A on the knitted animal.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the sculpture placed on a surface with a visibly granular, uneven texture resembling natural sand?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture is shown on a surface that has a granular and uneven texture, characteristic of natural sand. This is consistent with the beach setting visible in Image A where the knitted animal is also placed on sand.",
    "answer": "Yes"
