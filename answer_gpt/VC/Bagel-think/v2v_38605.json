      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is depicted in a surfing position, which often involves a forward-leaning stance and bent knees to maintain balance and maneuver on the waves.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Surfing typically involves using hands to balance or guide the surfboard through the waves.
