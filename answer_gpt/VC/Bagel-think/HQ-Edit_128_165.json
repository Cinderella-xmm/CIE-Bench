    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the two visible dark brown wooden ceiling beams, one running diagonally and one vertically, present and positioned as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible ceiling beams as the edited image features a jellyfish in an underwater setting. The absence of ceiling beams or similar structures in this marine environment indicates that any architectural details from Image A are not present.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the white, hand-textured stucco wall visible on the left side of the image, showing irregular surface imperfections and subtle brushwork marks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain a wall or any architectural elements as it depicts a jellyfish in the ocean. Therefore, the texture of a stucco wall is absent in the underwater scene presented.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the shadow pattern on the ceiling and wall composed of a radial, star-shaped lattice formed by the lantern’s cut-out design, matching the exact geometric configuration of the lantern’s panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a ceiling or lantern that would produce such shadow patterns. The jellyfish's luminescence does not create geometric shadows similar to those of a lantern on architectural surfaces.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the corner where the white wall meets the wooden ceiling clearly visible, forming a sharp right-angle edge at the upper left portion of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no architectural features like a wall or ceiling that would form a corner, as this image depicts an oceanic scene with a jellyfish. Therefore, no visible corner or right-angle edge exists in this context.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the metal chain, consisting of small linked rings, visibly connecting the top of the lantern to the ceiling fixture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain a lantern or ceiling fixture. The edited image reflects an underwater environment with a jellyfish without any metal chains or similar elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the light emanate from within the central chamber of the lantern, creating a bright focal point that radiates outward through the perforated panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the source of light is the bioluminescent jellyfish itself, not a lantern. The light is emitted from the jellyfish's body, but there are no perforated panels such as those in a lantern, indicating the answer is not applicable.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
