      "question": "Does the structure retain four distinct legs forming a wide base that converge upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited tower has been altered with ornate and fantastical elements like vines and glowing symbols, but visually it maintains a general structural form resembling the original Eiffel Tower, which has four legs forming a wide base as they converge upward towards the top. The fantasy design does not alter this fundamental architectural styling. Thus, the edited image retains the four distinct legs forming a wide base.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the tower’s shape vertically tapered, narrowing progressively from base to spire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a tower that visually incorporates features typical of a tapering structure, just like Image A's iconic Eiffel Tower, which narrows progressively from its wide base towards its narrower top. Although the edited image is adorned with fantastical and decorative elements, the basic tapering characteristic is preserved.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there three distinct horizontal levels or platforms visible along the tower’s height?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes ornate additions, yet it appears to have altered the visible platform sections compared to Image A, which traditionally showcases three distinct horizontal platforms at the identifying levels of the Eiffel Tower. The edited version seems to obscure or modify the distinctness of these platforms by blending them with decorative embellishments or altering structure visibility.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tower centrally positioned in the image, aligned with the center of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the fantastical transformation, the tower remains centrally positioned within the frame, much like in Image A. This central positioning contributes to its dominance in the image's composition and coherence in visual balance, making it the focal point.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a straight, symmetrical pathway extending from the foreground directly toward the base of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Images A and B display a pathway that extends symmetrically toward the base of the tower. Despite the embellishment in Image B, the pathway remains a prominent feature leading directly to the tower's base, indicating that the image retains this symmetrical design element.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the light source (sun or equivalent) located directly behind the base of the tower, creating a halo effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the positioning of a bright light source akin to Image A's sun, located directly behind the base, thereby creating a similar halo effect. This lighting serves as a striking visual element in both images, which contributes to defining the silhouette of the tower.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a visible cityscape in the background, extending horizontally behind the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cityscape continues to be observable behind the tower, extending horizontally. This mirrors Image A where the urban landscape spreads across the horizon, contributing to the contextual completeness and offering depth to the background scenery.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the tower significantly taller than all other structures in the image, dominating the vertical space?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the tower vertically dominating the visual space and rising substantially above any other structures present, similar to Image A. This towering effect establishes its prominent position within the composition, making the tower the central element of height and focus.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
