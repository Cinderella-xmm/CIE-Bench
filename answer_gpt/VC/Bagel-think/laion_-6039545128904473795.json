      "question": "Are there exactly four rotor assemblies arranged symmetrically around the central body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a cartoonish depiction of a drone with exaggerated and stylized features. The drone appears to have propeller-like components extending from its main body. However, due to the artistic and exaggerated style, it's challenging to determine if there are exactly four rotor assemblies symmetrically placed as in a typical drone. The visual style does not clearly show a symmetrical arrangement akin to what one would expect in a real drone. Therefore, the answer must reflect the artistic interpretation rather than adherence to realistic design. Image A shows a real quadcopter with four symmetric rotor assemblies, but Image B may not adhere to this realism.",

      "question": "Are there yellow triangular markings present on the top and side surfaces of the central body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drone is stylized with bright colors and features that aren't necessarily aligned with realistic markings of a typical drone. The color scheme includes yellow and other bright colors, which seem to mimic an energetic, comic-book style. Yellow markings are present, but due to the artistic rendering, the specifics of their shape (like being triangular) and placement (being on the top and sides) isn't as discernible or exact. In comparison to Image A, which has clear yellow triangular markings in a specific arrangement, Image B does not replicate these markings accurately.",

      "question": "Are the landing supports shaped like V-forms at each corner of the drone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoonish drone does not exhibit traditional landing supports or features that can be classified as V-forms. The comic-stylized rendering doesn't showcase typical quadcopter designs that include V-shaped landing gears. Image A has clear and traditional V-shaped landing supports, recognizable on a conventional quadcopter. The representation in Image B does not follow these details due to its stylized nature.",

      "question": "Does the central body feature sharp, angular edges and a polygonal structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a drone with sharp and exaggerated angles, fitting a more caricature-like polygonal structure. This stylized illustration features angular design akin to cartoon robots, potentially inspired by futuristic or superheroic themes. Compared to Image A, where the drone possesses a more defined and realistic polygonal structure with noticeable angular edges, Image B exaggerates these features for artistic effect.",

      "question": "Are there three small rectangular lights aligned horizontally on the top surface of the central body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B doesn't provide enough realistic detail to discern specific features like small rectangular lights on the drone's body. The comic style emphasizes vibrancy and fantasy over realistic detailing. Image A, on the other hand, clearly shows small rectangular light features on the top of the drone's central body. Image B, being a stylized representation, does not include these realistic details.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color scheme of the drone leans towards black and yellow, reflecting an artistic representation that matches the color description. The cartoonish style uses vivid colors prominently, and through this depiction, it maintains a predominantly black with yellow accents look, consistent with the color scheme of a typical drone. Comparatively, Image A also features a black drone with yellow accent markings, and the stylized version maintains similar colors.",
