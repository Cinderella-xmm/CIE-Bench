      "question": "Does the image retain the oval-shaped black sink?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sink has a round shape and features a mosaic design instead of a plain black surface. By analyzing the visual cues in Image B, it is evident that the sink is no longer oval or uniformly black. The surface design is ornate, differing from the simpler design in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the mirror still rectangular with an orange backlight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the mirror is still rectangular, it is mounted on a stone wall without an evident orange backlight. Instead, the lighting comes from sconces mounted on either side of the mirror and candles on the counter. These light sources provide a warm, ambient glow, but this does not define a backlight specifically in orange.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the cabinet underneath the mirror remain a floating style with the same position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sink setup is presented on a solid stone structure that is supported from the ground up, unlike the floating cabinet seen in Image A. This indicates a different approach to support and design, specifically lacking the floating style seen originally.",

      "question": "Are there metallic faucets present in the sink setup?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does feature a faucet, but it appears to be made of black or dark-colored metal rather than visibly shiny metallic. This is different from Image A, where metallic finish faucets are more apparent.",

      "question": "Is the window still positioned next to the sink?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The setup in Image B does not feature a window next to the sink. Instead, it is characterized by stone walls and arches with no visible windows in close proximity to the sink area. This contrasts with Image A, where a large window is prominent near the sink.",
