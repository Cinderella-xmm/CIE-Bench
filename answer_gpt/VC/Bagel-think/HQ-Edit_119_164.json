      "question": "Are the flat-topped acacia trees visible in the background, maintaining their characteristic silhouette and spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features flat-topped acacia trees. These trees retain their distinctive silhouettes, typical of acacia trees native to the savanna landscape, commonly recognized by their flat canopy structure. The visual spacing between these trees in the background remains consistent with the appearance in Image A, confirming their characteristic look and distribution.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the tall, golden-brown savanna grass present throughout the foreground and midground, matching the original texture and density?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows tall, golden-brown savanna grass in the foreground and midground. This grass maintains its original texture and density, apparent by its continuity and consistent appearance with that in Image A, featuring long strands characteristic of savanna vegetation.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sky display a continuous gradient from warm orange near the horizon to deep red and purple at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a sky with a gradient transitioning from warm orange near the horizon to deeper red and purple shades as one looks upwards. This gradient is consistent with sunset skies, characterized by such color transitions created by the setting sun and atmospheric effects, as seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the horizon line clearly visible and straight, dividing the sky from the savanna landscape at approximately one-third up the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the horizon line remains clearly visible and straight, effectively dividing the sky from the savanna landscape. This layout is consistent with the usual composition methods, where the horizon is positioned around the lower third of the image, as seen in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighting consistent with a low-angle sunset, producing warm highlights on the upper surfaces of the elephant and grass, and casting long shadows behind the subject?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's lighting is consistent with a low-angle sunset, where warm highlights appear on the upper surfaces of the elephant and grass. This lighting creates the characteristic golden hour effect, with long shadows trailing behind the subjects. This effect is similarly depicted in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the elephant positioned centrally in the frame, facing directly toward the viewer with its body aligned vertically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is positioned centrally in the frame, directly facing the viewer. Its body maintains a vertical alignment, contributing to a symmetrical and balanced composition. This positioning mirrors the central placement seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there no visible water bodies, rocky outcrops, or other animals in the background beyond the acacia trees and grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display additional elements like water bodies, rocky outcrops, or other animals in the background, apart from the acacia trees and grass. This observation parallels the same exclusion in Image A, where the background is designed to focus solely on these landscape elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Do the grass blades in the foreground show individual strands with slight variation in length and direction, contributing to a natural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground grass blades exhibit individual strands, varying slightly in length and direction, which creates a natural texture. This detail contributes to the realistic depiction of savanna grass visible in Image A.",
