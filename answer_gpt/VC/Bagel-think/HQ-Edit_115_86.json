      "question": "Are the pointe shoes visible and correctly positioned on the ballerina’s feet, with ribbons wrapped around the ankles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ballerina's feet are depicted with ballet flats or shoes rather than pointe shoes. The illustration shows simplified footwear with a uniform color without ribbons around the ankles. Using world knowledge, a typical ballet pointe shoe is designed to extend the dancer’s line and usually includes crisscrossed ribbons securing the shoe to the foot. Image A confirms the presence of properly positioned pointe shoes, characterized by ribbons wrapped around her ankles.",

      "question": "Is the ballerina wearing a tutu with a layered, flared skirt extending from the waist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ballerina is clearly illustrated wearing a tutu with a flared skirt, extending from her waistline. This matches typical ballet attire, which features layered and flared skirts that reach outward from the waist for enhanced aesthetic movement. Image A displays a similar tutu design, confirming the presence of a traditionally styled ballet skirt.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the ballerina have her hair styled in a tight bun at the back of her head with straight bangs across her forehead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ballerina's hair is styled in a tight bun at the back of her head without any sign of bangs across her forehead. This is a classic hairstyle for dancers for maintaining a polished look. Comparing with Image A, the dancer has her hair pulled back into a bun, but does not feature straight bangs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the ballerina standing en pointe with one leg slightly behind and bent, and the other leg supporting her weight in a balanced position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer stands with one leg slightly raised but flat on the surface, indicating she is not en pointe. En pointe requires the support of the foot's toe box, creating an upward stance. Image A displays a position en pointe with leg positioning that clearly supports the dancer’s weight using the toe.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the ballerina standing on a wooden floor composed of horizontal planks with visible grain and warm brown tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examining the environment indicates there is no depiction of a wooden floor like in Image A. Instead, a colorful abstract background is portrayed, void of specific flooring elements seen in Image A, which features a wooden floor with distinct grain details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the ballerina’s head tilted upward and turned toward the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head of the ballerina is slightly turned to the right, aligning with the tilt toward upward motion but largely forward-facing when combined with her posture. Image A similarly portrays the head turned toward the right with nuance in its upwards tilt. Thus the image largely suggests a sideways turn.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tutu is pink with embellishments visible as part of the design, supporting common tutu aesthetics of using such enhancements for visual appeal. Image A also shows a tutu primarily pink with intricate, though less overt, embellishments, affirming the color and decorative design presence in both images.",
