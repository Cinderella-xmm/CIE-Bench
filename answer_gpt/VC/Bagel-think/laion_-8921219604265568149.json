      "question": "Is the clock face present on the upper section of the left bell tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left bell tower does not show any clock face on its upper section. Visual cues include absence of any clock features, which is confirmed by the depiction of just windows. Typically, the clock face would be prominent and easily identifiable if present. Therefore, the absence leads to the conclusion that Image B does not include a clock face.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there two bells visible in the arches of the right bell tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's right bell tower displays no bells within its arches. The visible architectural elements are consistent with typical tower structures but lack the characteristic bell appearance. Bells would noticeably hang from the arches, which are not evident in this image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a circular stained-glass window with a floral or star-like pattern centered above the main entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a circular window centered above the main entrance featuring a distinct pattern resembling floral or star-like shapes. These patterns are visually identified based on their symmetric and decorative characteristics typical of stained-glass designs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a cross positioned at the highest point of the central roofline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a cross situated at the pinnacle of the central roofline. This architectural element is consistent with religious structures where crosses symbolize the building's ecclesiastical nature and are often placed visibly at such high points. Therefore, the cross's presence is confirmed.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there three doors on the façade: one large central door and two smaller side doors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the façade clearly shows three doors—a dominant central entryway flanked by two smaller doors on either side. This conforms to a standard design seen in churches and cathedrals, offering multiple access points.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the façade symmetrically divided by vertical columns and pilasters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a symmetrical division of its façade through columns and pilasters, providing structural balance and visual order. In classical architecture, these elements frequently serve both aesthetic and functional roles, enhancing symmetry.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the left bell tower have a pinkish dome with a cross on top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals that the left bell tower lacks a pinkish dome with a cross—there appears to be only a window-dominated structure without such a dome element. This leads to the determination based on absence of those features.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is there a multi-story building with balconies and wrought-iron railings to the right of the cathedral?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of any multi-story building with balconies or wrought-iron railings adjacent to the cathedral. Unlike urban settings that typically include such structures, Image B is focused solely on the cathedral model, indicating its standalone presentation.",
