      "question": "Does the image retain the stark black-and-white contrast characteristic of the zebra's stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes exhibit a high contrast between black and white, which is characteristic of zebra markings. This stark contrast is a defining feature of zebras and is maintained in the edited image. The visual information shows clean, well-defined stripes which are typical of a zebra's natural pattern, supporting the conclusion that the contrast is retained.",

      "question": "Is the zebra's mane still upright and striped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mane of the zebra is depicted as upright with pronounced black and white stripes. This aligns with the typical appearance of a zebra's mane in the wild, where the mane stands upright and carries the stripe pattern, serving both visual continuity with the body's stripes and possibly providing some environmental benefits. The visual information confirms that these characteristics are preserved in the edited image.",

      "question": "Are the zebra's ears still pointed and visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's ears are pointed and clearly visible. Their shape is distinct and aligns with the typical anatomical structure of a zebra. Ears being visible and pointed are common features found in zebra anatomy, assisting with hearing and aiding in communication within the species. The depiction in the image keeps these characteristics intact.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the zebra depicted in a grazing posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is shown with its head down, resembling a grazing posture. Grazing is a common behavior for zebras as they feed on grass. The visual posture in the image strongly suggests the action of grazing, as it mirrors typical feeding positions observed in zebras.",

      "is_correct": true

    {

      "question": "Is the background still primarily composed of green grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is altered from Image A and consists of an abstract pattern rather than green grass. The change in the background from a natural setting to a more artistic or stylized pattern is evident. The absence of green tones and the presence of abstract forms confirm that the original grassy background is not retained.",
