        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Ultraman is depicted inside a snow globe-style setting, which is suggestive of a playful or collectible item formation. The character retains its signature red and silver color scheme. This conclusion is drawn from recognizing that Ultraman's traditional colors are preserved to maintain character consistency. The design shows a predominant use of red on certain key parts such as the chest and arms combined with silver on other parts of the suit which aligns with Ultraman’s classic color palette.",
