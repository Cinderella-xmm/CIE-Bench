    "Question": "Q1: Is the classical archway with ornate carvings present and maintaining its original shape and position in the frame?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible archway with carvings, located above the toy pigeon. The design resembles a classical style similar to historical architecture, although it is part of a wooden shelf instead of an outdoor architectural setting as in Image A. The ornate carving pattern is different from the stone appearance seen in Image A. Thus, the original shape and position are not maintained from Image A to Image B.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the Corinthian column capital with acanthus leaf detailing visible and correctly positioned beneath the spherical perch?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no Corinthian column capital resembling the style seen in Image A. Image B features a wooden shelf, with a toy pigeon on top. In Image A, the decorative capital is positioned below the pigeon's perch. This design and positioning are absent in the edited image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the perch located directly on top of the Corinthian column capital, maintaining its original vertical alignment?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a toy pigeon positioned on two cookie houses, rather than a perch located on top of a Corinthian column capital directly beneath it as seen in Image A. Therefore, the vertical alignment and positioning are not maintained from the original image to the edited image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the tall fluted column on the left and the distant spired buildings visible in their original positions and silhouettes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, these elements are noticeably absent. While Image A features a fluted column and distant architectural structures in a skyline, Image B shows an indoor shelf with toy decorations and cookies, lacking any such architectural features.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the sky depicted as bright blue with scattered white cumulus clouds, matching the original image?",
    "explanation": "Image B exhibits a background with clouds within the shelf placed as back decor, but it doesn't portray an open sky with bright blue and scattered white cumulus clouds as seen in Image A. The context of the depiction varies the effect and scope of the sky's appearance.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the floral and scroll carvings on the arch and column frame present and accurately rendered?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shelf has carvings that may resemble decorative motifs, but the accuracy and specifics of floral and scroll carvings in stone as seen in Image A are not maintained. The shelf's design, simulating the theory but altering the context, reduces the resemblance significantly.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the pigeon oriented sideways with its head turned slightly toward the viewer, maintaining its original posture?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a toy pigeon facing forward instead of sideways, with differences in posture compared to the real pigeon in Image A. The edited image subjects are different in orientation and material representation from the original real pigeon posture.",
