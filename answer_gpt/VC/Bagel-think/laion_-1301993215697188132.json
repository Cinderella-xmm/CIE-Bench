      "question": "Is the blue herringbone-textured jacket retained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character depicted is an owl, which cannot wear human clothing. Instead, the owl has feathers that resemble clothing. The visual representation does not include a herringbone-textured jacket, but rather feathers that may imitate clothing but lack the specific texture present in a herringbone jacket. Thus, using world knowledge that owls don't wear clothes, it's reasonable to conclude the jacket is not retained.",

      "question": "Are the collar and lapel shape of the blue jacket preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is an owl with feathers, rather than a human wearing a jacket with lapels and collars. Therefore, the specific human clothing elements like the lapel and collar shape in the original Image A are not present. The drawing of an owl replaces these fashion elements with natural bird features.",

      "question": "Are two microphones visible in front of the speaker in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an owl with two microphone-like objects in front, similar to the placement in Image A. The depiction mirrors the concept of microphones through artistic representation, consistent with world knowledge that microphones are used by speakers, even in a cartoonish form.",

      "question": "Is the speaker’s right hand raised with an open palm in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl’s right wing is raised in a similar manner to a raised human hand with an open palm. The positioning mirrors the hand in Image A, but adapted for the owl illustration. This suggests continuity in the gesture, interpreted through creative design to match the original pose.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a circular emblem is depicted at the podium base. The emblem carries a blue center and decorative gold elements, arranged in a stylized pattern consistent with Image A’s emblem design. These visual traits are retained, albeit through artistic interpretation, maintaining emblematic similarity between the images.",
