      "question": "Is the statue’s right hand raised in a gesture with fingers extended upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right hand of the statue is depicted as being raised with fingers extended upwards, which is a common gesture often interpreted as a sign of benediction or emphasis. This conclusion is drawn from observing the angle of the hand and position of the fingers, typical of classical sculptures. This matches the gestures seen in various historical and religious sculptures.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the statue have a visible beard and long hair on the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head of the statue appears to have features that suggest the presence of long hair and a beard, as inferred by the contours and shading around the head and face. This is a common characteristic seen in historical sculptures depicting male figures, particularly those styled after traditional historical or religious figures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there clearly visible folds and drapes in the robe covering the statue’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the statue covered in robes, where the folds and drapes are visible due to the shading and the way the clothing is modeled. Such details are often crafted in sculptures to add realism and depict the texture and flow of fabric, common in classical pieces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the year “1882” visibly inscribed on the front face of the pedestal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the inscriptions on the pedestal are altered with a darker appearance, making the fine detail of the year difficult to visually confirm. Therefore, without clear visible evidence in the image, the year '1882' cannot be confirmed to be inscribed on the front face of the pedestal.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a dark rectangular plaque affixed to the lower front section of the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the pedestal of the statue with a dark rectangular area at the lower front section, which suggests the presence of a plaque or similar feature. The contrast of the dark rectangle against the lighter material of the pedestal leads to the inference that it is a plaque, a common feature for inscribing information on monuments.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the statue positioned directly on top of the pedestal, aligned vertically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue is shown standing directly on the pedestal, ensuring a vertical alignment. This typical alignment is standard for stability and aesthetics in sculptural installations, ensuring the statue's center of mass is properly supported by the pedestal.",
