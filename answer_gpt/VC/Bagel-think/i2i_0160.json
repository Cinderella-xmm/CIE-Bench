      "question": "Do the birds retain their original feather patterns including the brown and white colors and striated wing markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the birds display brown and white feather coloring, and their wing markings show striations similar to what is typically observed on small songbirds. These visual cues indicate retention of the original feather patterns. Based on world knowledge, these consistent markings and colors are characteristic elements used to identify bird species and are preserved in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the birds still perched on the branch with their beaks open as if singing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the posture of the birds on the branch remains unchanged; they are both standing with slightly open beaks suggesting an activity like singing or communicating. The open-beak position is consistent with their original depiction. This scene captures a common behavior seen in birds during communication or calls.",

      "question": "Is the branch still present with the same structure and positioning beneath the birds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The branch in Image B appears consistent with the original depiction in terms of structure and positioning. The branch is still supporting the birds, maintaining the original positioning under the birds similar to its appearance in Image A. Based on world knowledge, a perch like a branch provides a stable platform for birds and is visually unchanged.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves retain their shapes and positions as seen in Image A. The leaves are positioned around the birds, maintaining their original form and arrangement. Visual clues in Image B suggest that the foliage structure has not been altered and remains consistent.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the change from a bright sunlit atmosphere to a night-time setting with a starry sky in Image B, the birds continue to show lighting effects that highlight their forms. The illumination along their feathers and outline still contributes to the birds' visibility and form, suggesting the original lighting effects are retained, emphasizing their appearance in a similar way.",
