      "question": "Is the elderly man depicted with a full white beard and white hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is shown with white hair and a full white beard. This conclusion is drawn from the visual observation of his hair and facial hair. World knowledge tells us that elderly individuals often have white or gray hair, which supports the conclusion that the edited image presents an elderly man with a full white beard and white hair.",

      "question": "Is the man standing upright with his right hand holding an object and his left hand in his coat pocket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is depicted standing upright with an object in his right hand, which resembles a golden staff or scepter. His left hand appears to be resting at his side rather than in his coat pocket. World knowledge about body posture helps to conclude that his left hand is outside the pocket, contrasting with the typical imagery of hands in coat pockets for warmth or style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the man wear a long overcoat over a sweater vest, shirt, tie, and trousers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is depicted wearing a light blue suit jacket over a vest, shirt, and tie. While trousers are visible, the overcoat in the original image has been replaced with the suit jacket in the edited image, which alters the layering of clothing pieces as initially described.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there an oval-shaped reflective pool directly behind the man?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is standing near a body of water that seems to reflect the surrounding area, positioned directly behind him. The pool's shape appears to be oval-like, based on its symmetrical curves, though the shape is not explicitly defined as a perfect oval. This conclusion combines visual cues along with common design elements to infer the shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the man standing on a cobblestone path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground beneath the man's feet appears to be made of large tiles or slabs rather than small cobblestones. The visual texture of cobblestones typically includes smaller, rounded stones, which do not appear in this depiction. The path is more reminiscent of paved stone, affecting the interpretation of the ground material.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the man positioned at the edge of the pool, facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man appears to be positioned at the edge of what could be perceived as a pool, given the water reflection and the arrangement. The man is also facing forward, as evidenced by his body orientation in relation to the viewer or audience. This visual setup suggests he is indeed at the pool's edge, facing the front.",

      "question": "Is the man holding an object in his right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is clearly holding an object in his right hand that resembles a staff with a decorative head. The object is prominently displayed and drawn, which makes it distinct and easy to identify from the visual information presented.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the ground around the pool made of stone or cobblestone material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground visualized around the water body features large tiles or slabs that suggest a stone material. This is consistent with stone paths found in urban and landscaped settings. The regular pattern and size of these tiles differ from cobblestones, emphasizing a smoother stone finish.",
