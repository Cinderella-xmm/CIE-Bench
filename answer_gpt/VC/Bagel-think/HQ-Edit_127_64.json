      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the Eiffel Towerâ€™s full lattice structure, including its three-tiered arches and pointed spire, clearly visible and structurally accurate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower is depicted in a graphical and partial manner, missing some structural details and appearing in silhouette. The absence of detailed arches, a pointed spire, and lattice work indicates the depiction is stylized rather than a detailed representation. The Eiffel Tower lacks a structurally accurate representation in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the hedges arranged in a straight line with consistent cubic shapes and even spacing along the left side of the pathway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B is a stylized illustration focusing on the Eiffel Tower, it lacks detailed foreground elements like the hedges visible in Image A. Therefore, the hedges as described do not exist in Image B to evaluate their arrangement or consistency.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sandy pathway extend directly from the foreground toward the Eiffel Tower, maintaining a straight trajectory without bends or interruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not showcase a detailed pathway as seen in Image A. The focus in the edited image is more on graphic elements and the structured depiction of the Eiffel Tower. Thus, the specific trajectory of the pathway, as described, is not present or visible in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sun located in the upper-left portion of the sky with a clear starburst effect radiating outward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of the sky with solar elements. The image is focused on design layout, with textual and graphic elements centered around the Eiffel Tower. The depiction of the sun with a starburst effect, as seen in Image A, is absent in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are black lampposts with traditional lanterns evenly spaced along both sides of the pathway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B primarily features a stylized depiction of the Eiffel Tower along with text and does not include detailed elements such as pathways or lampposts, which would be more characteristic of a photograph rather than a graphic depiction. Therefore, black lampposts are not present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there multiple individuals visible in the park, positioned naturally along the path and grassy areas, interacting with the environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include naturalistic representations of individuals in a park environment. Instead, it focuses on stylized elements and a textual presentation around the Eiffel Tower. Thus, there is no depiction of people or park activity in Image B.",
