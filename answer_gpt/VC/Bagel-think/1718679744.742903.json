      "question": "Is the crocodile's snout with two visible teeth present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the crocodile is represented in a cartoonish and stylized form with clear black outlines and bold colors. The snout is visible, and there are two stylized teeth drawn on it, maintaining the original characteristic of showing teeth as seen in crocodilians. The visual cues indicate an artistic representation, but the two teeth are preserved in the design.",

      "question": "Is the colorful knitted hat with a red pom-pom still present on the crocodile's head in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a simplified version of the colorful knitted hat present on the crocodile's head. The red pom-pom at the top is also stylized but still present. The use of bright colors and patterns is indicative of maintaining the original hat theme in a stylized form.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the crocodile has cartoonish sunglasses that are orange-framed with reflective lenses. This maintains the characteristic elements from the original image, both in placement over the eyes and in terms of color and style, albeit in a stylized manner.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the crocodile's head oriented forward with a slight leftward turn in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crocodile's head is oriented in a forward position and slightly turned to the left, as seen in the cartoon depiction. The profile and posture are consistent with how animal heads are typically depicted to show perspective and dimensionality, reinforcing the original posture.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, there is no indication of the crocodile being in water. The background is a solid color with no representational elements of water, such as waves or reflections. This contrasts with Image A, where the water is visible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunglasses are depicted with solid reflective lenses, but there are no detailed reflections visible as one might observe in a realistic image. The design is highly stylized and uses solid colors without nuanced reflections that would typically appear in reflective surfaces.",
