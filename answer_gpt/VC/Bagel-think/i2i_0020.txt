    "Question": "Q1: Is the train represented in a red-and-gray color block scheme?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the train is depicted using simplified color blocks, primarily in red and gray. The red color is used for the horizontal stripes along the train's side, while gray represents the main body of the train. Using large, distinct color sections like these aligns with common design elements for minimalist or graphic representations. This approach simplifies complex objects to understand them better visually.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the sign circular with the text 'STOP' clearly displayed?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sign is shaped like a stop sign, which is generally octagonal, not circular. However, the stop sign in Image B clearly displays the text 'STOP'. Stop signs are typically in this shape to provide a clear and recognizable caution to stop and ensure that any driver or pedestrian can understand it quickly.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the train positioned parallel to the tracks?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the train aligned parallel to the tracks underneath it. The lines representing the tracks run horizontally in the image and exhibit parallelism by maintaining the same direction as the train. Such positioning is indicative of stationary trains at a station or when a train is passing by, where parallel alignment is expected for safety and structural integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there green mountain outlines in the background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are simplified representations of mountains in the background, using broad green triangular shapes to depict stylized mountain outlines. These are not photorealistic but serve as an abstract representation of a mountainous landscape, common in graphics designed to symbolize terrain without detailed features.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are simplified track lines present beneath the train?",
    "explanation": "Image B includes stylized and simplified track lines beneath the train, represented by solid black lines converging towards the horizon. This graphic approach simplifies the representation of railroad tracks, using minimal lines to depict the essence of tracks running parallel to the train.",
    "answer": "Yes"
