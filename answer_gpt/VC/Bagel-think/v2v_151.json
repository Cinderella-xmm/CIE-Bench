      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object representing the tiger is a stylized, chibi version which maintains the classic striped pattern typical of tigers. This is evident because, despite the cartoonish and simplified form, the stripes are drawn in the correct positions to resemble those of a real tiger. This use of simplified yet characteristic features is common in chibi or cartoon art to ensure recognizability. Therefore, the tiger retains its distinctive stripe pattern.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi tiger is clearly holding a skateboard in its paws. This is observable as the skateboard is positioned in front of the tiger, being grasped by both front paws, similar to a previous visual placement. Despite the artistic style change to a chibi form, the concept of the object being held remains consistent with typical portrayal of character-object interaction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard held by the chibi tiger indeed displays a yin-yang symbol on its underside, directly visible in the image. This pattern replicates the depiction method for iconic symbols often used to create a point of connection with cultural or thematic messages. Thus, the skateboard retains this distinguishing feature.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the chibi tiger continues to wear a military-style cap. The cap is visually identical in shape and positioning as in Image A, including details like the structured brim and prominent badge, which show the intended replication of the original characteristic element.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the posture of the chibi tiger is not indicative of a seated position similar to an actual or lifelike tiger, as demonstrated in Image A. Instead, it stands more upright in a typical cartoonish stance featuring rounded, simplified limbs that suggest a playful or animated pose rather than a naturalistic seated one. This change aligns with chibi styling that often aims at a cute, non-realistic portrayal.",
