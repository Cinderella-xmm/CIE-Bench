    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are both the main triangular sail and the smaller jib sail present and correctly positioned on the mast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a representation of a sailboat with two sails. The main triangular sail is the larger sail and is positioned appropriately along the mast. The smaller jib sail is also present and located at the front, attached lower than the main sail, which is typical in sailboat design. The positioning appears correct with respect to typical sailboat configurations.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a single vertical mast located centrally along the length of the boat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden sculpture depicts a single vertical mast approximately located centrally along the length of the boat. This is a common trait for sailboats, providing stability and proper distribution of the sail's load.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the boat have a sharply pointed bow extending forward from the hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stylized, wooden sailboat model. The bow is not sharply pointed but is instead a more rounded or blunt interpretation typical of wooden models emphasizing artistry over precise replication of nautical design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a covered section with open sides and vertical railings located over the midsection of the hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden model does not feature any covered section with open sides or vertical railings over the midsection. It is a simplified sculpture capturing a sailboat's overall aesthetic rather than detailed architectural features like railings.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a small red flag attached to the stern of the boat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, there is no discernible detail of a red flag attached to the stern. The model is simplified and likely focuses on the timber's grain and artistic form rather than intricate details such as color elements.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the sails, mast, deck, and bow aligned in their original spatial configuration, maintaining the correct proportions and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a stylized and artistic version of the sailboat, using simplified lines and forms. The general alignment of elements such as sails and mast appears consistent with standard sailboat arrangement principles. However, the lack of detailed features, like the deck and exact bow shape, indicates artistic reinterpretation rather than an exact replication of proportions and orientation.",
