        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Without considering the face, there is no evidence in the edited image (second image) to suggest that the subject's eyes are blue. The facial area is not visible due to the blur, and any eye color detail cannot be discerned.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the subject does have dark wavy hair visible and appears to have feather-like adornments on either side.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the face is blurred, the posture and the alignment of the body in the edited image suggest that the subject is facing forward. Any expression cannot be assessed due to the blur effect, thus we focus on the direct forward facing body pose.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings appear to be symmetrically positioned behind the subjectâ€™s shoulders, contributing to a balanced visual composition that fits well within character designs. This symmetry is crucial in maintaining consistency and aesthetic appeal in artistic portraits.",
