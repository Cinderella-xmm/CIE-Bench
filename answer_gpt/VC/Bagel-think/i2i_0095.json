        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror is a central element in the bathroom design, maintaining a clean and modern aesthetic. The shape is decidedly rectangular, which aligns with standard bathroom mirror styles providing a straightforward reflection area. The illumination around the edges of the mirror offers enhanced lighting, typical for aiding visibility during grooming tasks. Without prior knowledge of Image A, these observations allow us to infer that Image B's mirror retains its rectangular shape while incorporating illuminated edges, a design choice for both functionality and aesthetic appeal.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sink on the countertop exhibits characteristics in line with a bowl-style vessel sink. Vessel sinks sit atop the countertop rather than recessed within it, often providing a modern and elegant appearance. This type of sink is prominent in Image B as a rounded object stationed centrally on the vanity, signaling its functionality and purpose without needing a comparison to Image A. Thus, the bowl-style vessel sink remains present in Image B.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the towel rack situated adjacent to the left side of the mirror appears to be made of matte black material, a common choice for modern fixtures due to its blend of aesthetics and durability. It serves the practical function of holding towels within easy reach from the sink area. Without comparing directly to Image A, these observations suggest that the towel rack remains attached to the wall in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the countertop features decorative items such as a vase with branches and a small bottle. These elements often serve the dual purposes of decoration and utility, contributing to the aesthetic ambiance of the bathroom. Their arrangement on the countertop implies an intention to maintain both style and practicality without referencing Image A. The presence of these items in Image B suggests they are still arranged as part of the bathroom's design setup.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vanity unit is positioned directly below the mirror, featuring a white base with a natural wood countertop. This design choice is popular for its clean lines and contrast, offering both storage and a surface for daily grooming activities. Observing Image B alone, these aspects align with typical bathroom design principles, indicating the vanity unit is correctly positioned without needing a direct comparison to Image A.",
