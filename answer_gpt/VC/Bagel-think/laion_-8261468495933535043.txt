    "Question": "Q1: Are the two elongated sausage-shaped forms positioned on the left side of the plate?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are two elongated objects that resemble sausages located on the left side of the plate. The mosaic-like pattern provides an artistic transformation but still maintains the recognizable shape and position. Common sense suggests sausages are often arranged due to their shape, making identification straightforward despite the editing.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is there a circular form with a central orange-yellow disc representing the egg yolk located in the lower right quadrant of the plate?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a circular shape that mimics an egg, with a distinct central orange-yellow area representing the yolk, located in the lower right quadrant of the plate. The mosaic pattern retains this visual configuration, allowing recognition based on common egg representation in meals.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a cluster of green and red elements in the upper right portion of the plate representing the salad?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a cluster composed of green and red mosaic fragments situated in the upper right part of the plate. These elements are likely to depict a salad, as salads commonly consist of green leafy vegetables with additions like cherry tomatoes, which are red.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the meal arranged on a circular gray plate?",
    "explanation": "While Image B presents a predominantly white plate due to the mosaic effect lacking distinct pigmentation, the circular shape of the plate can still be discerned. The original image (Image A) shows a gray plate, providing the context that the editing only altered texture and not color.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the sausages on the left, the egg in the lower right, and the salad in the upper right of the plate?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a meal with sausages positioned on the left, an egg on the lower right, and a salad in the upper right. This layout matches typical meal presentation logic and is visually distinct despite the mosaic transformation applied.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there distinct red circular elements interspersed among the green elements in the salad cluster?",
    "explanation": "Image B includes red circular elements among the predominantly green mosaic fragments in the salad cluster. These resemble common salad additions like cherry tomatoes, allowing for identification despite the artistic editing.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are there thin green linear elements (rosemary) placed along the sausages?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not clearly show any thin green linear elements resembling rosemary. The mosaic effect might obscure finer details, but visually there are no distinct representations of such elements noted along the sausages, unlike Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
