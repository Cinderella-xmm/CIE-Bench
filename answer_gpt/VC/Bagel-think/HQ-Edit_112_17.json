      "question": "Does the hammer retain its claw-shaped end and dual-headed structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer is observed to have a dual-head structure, with one side meant for striking and the other claw-shaped for removing nails. This design is consistent with traditional claw hammers. Thus, based on the visual appearance of the hammer in Image B, I conclude that it retains its claw-shaped end and dual-headed structure.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the chisel retain its flat, rectangular blade with a beveled edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tool identified as a chisel with a blue handle is observed to have a flat, wide, rectangular blade with a tapering edge, which fits the common description of a chisel. This indicates that the chisel retains its typical flat and rectangular blade with a beveled edge structure.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the file retain its long, straight, narrow shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the file can be identified as a long, straight, and narrow metal tool, consistent with the typical design of a hand file. It appears unchanged in its fundamental shape and structure.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the tools positioned in the same relative arrangement as in the original image (e.g., hammer diagonal, chisel crossing file)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the hammer is placed diagonally, and the chisel crosses over the file. This arrangement suggests that the relative placement of the tools is consistent between both images, maintaining a similar spatial configuration.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shavings retain their curled, ribbon-like shape and approximate distribution around the tools?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shavings in Image B exhibit a curled, ribbon-like appearance similar to Image A, and they are scattered in a way that approximates their original distribution around the tools. This indicates that the curled appearance and approximate placement are retained as in the original.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there exactly five tools present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Counting the tools visible in Image B, there are exactly five distinct items present, aligning with the count from Image A. Therefore, the number of tools remains unchanged.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the wrench-like tool retain its open-ended jaw and metal shaft shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a tool resembling a wrench is visible, characterized by an open-ended jaw and a cylindrical metal shaft, which is a common design for such tools. This confirms that it retains its typical wrench-like form.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
