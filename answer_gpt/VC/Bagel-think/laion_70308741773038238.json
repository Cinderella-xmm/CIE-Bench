      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area where the rear license plate is usually located is obscured or altered, and the usual text 'BENTLEY GREENWICH' is not discernible. The surface appears to have a texture or design that covers the original text. Therefore, the 'BENTLEY GREENWICH' text is not visible.",

      "question": "Does the vehicle retain a silver metallic color as its primary surface tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the primary surface tone of the vehicle appears to be altered with some graphical or textured effect. While there might be some underlying silver tone, the edited image shows a more intricate surface that deviates from a standard metallic silver finish. Thus, it can be concluded that the vehicle does not retain a plain silver metallic color as its primary surface tone.",

      "question": "Is there a continuous chrome trim line visible along the lower side of the vehicle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examining the lower side of the vehicle, the usual chrome trim line that might be expected on luxury vehicles is not evidently visible due to the altered surface texture. The graphical overlay covers or disrupts the typical chrome appearance. Therefore, a continuous chrome trim line is not visible along the lower side of the vehicle.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, observing the area where the vehicle is placed, it is clearly resting on a circular black platform, which is consistent with automotive display setups where the vehicle can be showcased in a clear and complete manner. Hence, the vehicle is indeed displayed on a circular black platform.",
