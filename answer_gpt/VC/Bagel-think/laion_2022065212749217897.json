      "question": "Are the eyes almond-shaped with a grayish-blue iris and visible upper and lower eyelashes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (second image), the eyes are not directly visible due to the illustration style characteristic of keychains or pins. Such styles often do not include detailed features like almond-shaped eyes, iris color, or eyelashes that would be clear in a realistic depiction. Therefore, based on this style of artwork and world knowledge about typical keychain designs, which are more simplistic and abstract, the answer would be that the eyes aren't depicted with those specific features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a receding hairline with thin, light gray hair present only on the sides and back of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a bald animated figure, common in keychain designs for characters depicted with bald or minimal hair features. It lacks realistic hair texture, color detail, or receding pattern. Based on this visual style and understanding of typical representations in animated or cartoon keychains, there is no depiction of a receding hairline with specific hair only on the sides and back.",

      "question": "Does the shirt have thin vertical red and white stripes running along the collar and down the placket on a dark blue background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the shirt appears to have horizontal stripes in varying colors, which are stylized and simple, typical of a cartoon or animated design. This differs markedly from a vertical-striped shirt you might find in realistic clothing designs, indicating that the expected pattern is not present due to the abstract nature of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible white button at the top of the shirt’s placket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows an animated figure with a shirt that does not feature visible buttons, as those details are often omitted or simplified in such stylized representations. This simplification is common in cartoons or keychains, where intricate details are minimal. Thus, based on this understanding, the answer is no.",

      "question": "Does the gray blazer have a notched lapel with a defined edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the figure's clothing is simplified and abstract, characteristic of graphical or cartoon keychain designs. The blazer isn’t discernibly detailed with notched lapels or advanced tailoring features that would be seen in a photo-realistic image. Given the illustration style, such features are not present.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are fine lines visible around the eyes and forehead, and is the skin texture subtly detailed with pores?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The animated style of the second image does not include intricate details such as skin texture or fine lines due to its simplified design. Such details are not typically featured in simplified cartoon representations, where the focus is more on overall shape and color. Therefore, the expected skin texture and fine lines aren't depicted.",
