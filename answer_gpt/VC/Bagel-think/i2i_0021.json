      "question": "Are the three sheep positioned near each other, with one adult sheep interacting closely with the two younger ones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, looking at the arrangement of characters, there are three chibi animals positioned near each other. The middle character seems to be slightly larger and positioned between two smaller figures, which resemble the positioning of an adult with two younger companions, implying interaction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the chibi sheep maintain their original postures, with the adult sheep standing upright and the younger ones leaning towards it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi characters are depicted as more cartoonish with rounded shapes. Based on traditional standing postures in similar art styles, the figures are standing upright due to the vertical alignment and the context of being near a fence, reflecting an upright posture similar to sheep interacting with a barrier.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the chibi sheep retain identifiable sheep-like body proportions, such as a rounded body and small legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi style typically features exaggeratedly rounded bodies and small limbs for cuteness. The characters shown have distinctly round shapes and small legs, maintaining a sheep-like appearance within the chibi art style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible interaction displayed between the adult chibi sheep and the two younger ones, suggesting care or attention?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement and proximity of the chibi figures suggest interaction. While chibi art does not show detailed facial expressions or gestures, the closeness of the figures and typical interpretations of chibi art styles imply a connection or interaction.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the chibi sheep retain a representation of their woolly texture, even in a stylized or simplified manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi style simplifies details while maintaining essential characteristics. The figures lack intricate wool textures but may have simplistic swirling lines or fluff-like elements to denote texture, which is typical of chibi interpretations of fluffy animals.",
