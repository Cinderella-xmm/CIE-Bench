      "question": "Does the keychain retain the dog's original fur pattern with a mix of dark and light tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain depicts a dog with a cartoonish design. The keychain primarily uses a bold outline with a uniform color palette, as typical for such depictions, which doesn't show a complex fur pattern with varied shades. In Image A, the dog has a natural mix of dark and light tones in its fur. Thus, the simplified keychain design does not retain the original fur pattern seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the chibi keychain oriented in a way that suggests it is looking toward the fire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi keychain is shown held in a hand with no background elements indicating directionality or presence of fire. Its orientation depends on the hand's angle rather than an actual scene. In Image A, the dog is indeed oriented towards what appears to be a fire. However, the keychain does not provide any context related to direction or orientation towards a fire.",

      "question": "Is the dark rectangular pedestal still present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is entirely different and focuses on a keychain being held in a hand. There are no elements like a dark rectangular pedestal visible. In Image A, such a pedestal is present next to the dog. Therefore, the pedestal is not included in the edited image.",

      "question": "Does the background retain its dark, moody appearance with scattered orange sparks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible background scene, as the focus is on the chibi keychain held against a plain, light-colored backdrop. In contrast, Image A features a dark, moody background with orange sparks. Therefore, the edited image lacks any background elements that resemble the original scene.",

      "question": "Does the chibi keychain retain the dog's perked-up ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi keychain shows a dog with its ears prominently perked up, similar to how the dog's ears are perked in Image A. Despite the stylistic differences, such as the chibi design, the feature of perked-up ears is consistent between the two images.",
