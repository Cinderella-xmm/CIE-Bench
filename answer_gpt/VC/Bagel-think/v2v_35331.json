      "question": "Is the background composed of green grass with visible blades and natural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a background that appears to be green grass. The blades are visible, and the texture is detailed enough to reflect a natural look. This perception is based on the observed patterns and variations in the grass, which align with common characteristics of natural, healthy grass.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there soft shadows cast by the subject(s) onto the grass, consistent with natural outdoor lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no discernible shadows visible beneath the chihuahua and banana. Shadows in natural outdoor scenes are usually evident based on light direction and intensity, but they are missing here either due to post-processing or lighting setup that does not produce obvious shadows.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the fused form positioned directly on the grass surface, with contact points visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chihuahua and banana appear to rest directly on the grass, and contact points (where they touch the ground) can be observed. This is evident from the positioning where the lower part of the banana and paws of the chihuahua meet the ground level.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the grass predominantly green with natural variations in shade and tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays grass that is mainly green with a mix of lighter and darker hues, suggesting natural variation as typically seen in outdoor grass. These variations add to the natural appearance, mimicking the effect of sunlight and natural growth patterns.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the fused form incorporate both yellow and tan hues, reflecting the original banana and dog colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the image maintains the colors of both the banana and chihuahua. The banana is yellow, consistent with its natural appearance, and the chihuahua has a tan hue. These color choices accurately reflect the original colors of the objects as seen in common depictions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are individual blades of grass visible in the foreground and midground, contributing to a textured surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits grass with distinct blades visible in both the foreground and midground, creating a textured and detailed surface characteristic of grass in natural settings. This perception is drawn from the distinct visibility of individual blades that add to the realism of the scene.",
