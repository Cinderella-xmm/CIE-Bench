    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the central tower of the fortress composed of multiple stacked, progressively smaller rectangular tiers forming a stepped pyramid shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central structure of the fortress resembles a series of stacked, smaller rectangular blocks, creating a look similar to a stepped pyramid. This is a common architectural design for multi-tiered towers where each subsequent level is smaller than the one below, leading to a tiered appearance.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there regular, alternating tooth-like projections (crenellations) along the upper edges of the fortress walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the representation of the fortress as a cookie structure includes these tooth-like projections along the top edges of the walls, signifying crenellations, which are typical of defensive architecture for providing cover to guards.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a prominent arched opening located at the lower front section of the fortress, serving as a main entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display a visible prominent arched opening on the facade of the cookie fortress. The focus seems to be more on the overall shape and aesthetic of the design rather than specific architectural details like a main entrance.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the waterfall originate from a gap in the cliff face directly beneath the fortress wall and cascade downward into the river below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the small representation of a waterfall is seen coming directly out from beneath the cookie fortress structure, suggesting that water is flowing from the wall directly into what is depicted as a river below. This mimics the concept of water flowing beneath a structure.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the fortress situated on a raised cliff overlooking a river that flows through a narrow canyon below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fortress is placed on a cookie base that simulates elevated terrain. However, the river and canyon are simplified into a single path without depicting a narrow canyon feature, focusing more on a stylized landscape on a plate rather than complete topographical accuracy.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are clusters of green shrubs and trees visible along the canyon walls and riverbanks surrounding the fortress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses small, green elements to represent trees or shrubs around the base of the cookie fortress and river, providing visual support to the landscape with greenery adjacent to the water features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the fortress have a solid rectangular base with vertical walls and corner towers supporting the upper levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's fortress maintains a simple, solid rectangular form at its base. The arrangement resembles a basic fortress structure with flat vertical walls, and distinct corner blocks represent towers, effectively supporting the rest of the structure.",
