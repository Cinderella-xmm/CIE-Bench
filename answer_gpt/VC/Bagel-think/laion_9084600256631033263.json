      "question": "Is the \"DATSUN\" text visibly present and centered on the front of the decanter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the front of the object resembles a decanter and lacks detailed elements such as text or emblems due to its minimalistic design approach. It is aimed to abstract the carâ€™s design into a smooth, glossy surface. Therefore, the 'DATSUN' text is not visibly present or centered on the front of the decanter-like shape.",

      "question": "Is the \"240Z\" script visible on the side of the decanter near the front wheel well?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, analyzing the visual cues, there are no specific inscriptions such as '240Z' on the side near the front wheel well of the decanter. The design focuses on a streamlined form, which abstracts away specific textual details present on cars.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the decanter maintain the long hood and short rear deck proportions of the original car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the object takes the form of a streamlined container with a relatively uniform height across its length. This contrasts with the typical vehicle design proportions of a long hood and short rear deck as seen in Image A. Therefore, the decanter does not maintain these proportions.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are vertical slats visible on the front of the decanter, mimicking the original grille pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the decanter-like object is smooth and void of distinguishing features such as grille patterns, including vertical slats. The edited design abstracts such details away, focusing on sleekness rather than imitation of specific car parts.",

      "question": "Is the \"DATSUN\" emblem positioned centrally on the front face of the decanter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Reviewing Image B, the edited object lacks detailed car parts, including the 'DATSUN' emblem which might be expected at the front. As its design philosophy is abstract and lacks textual details, the 'DATSUN' emblem is not positioned centrally on the front of this decanter.",
