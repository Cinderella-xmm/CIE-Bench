      "question": "Are all leaf-shaped elements in the image, including those used as heads, clearly five-pointed maple leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves used as heads for the characters and as decoration on the card are intended to resemble five-pointed maple leaves, typically with a pattern that resembles the natural structure of a maple leaf. Visual inspection of these elements in Image B confirms that they are indeed five-pointed, which is a characteristic of maple leaves. The visual consistency of these elements with known maple leaf shapes supports this conclusion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are all leaf elements rendered exclusively in shades of orange, yellow, and red?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf elements are seen in various warm tones representing fall colors. Examination of these elements shows that they adhere to the palette of orange, yellow, and red. No other colors are evident in the leaf elements, aligning with common autumn hues. This consistency across the image indicates adherence to the specified color scheme.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a solid brown rectangular border surrounding the central illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a rectangular border is evident that frames the central illustration. This border appears to be solid brown, consistent with typical card design principles that provide a framed effect. Comparatively, in Image A, the same border is present, reinforcing the observation that Image B maintains this element. The border's solid nature and its brown coloration are verified through visual consistency with Image A.",

      "question": "Is the background of the card uniformly white?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the card's background appears to be uniformly white. There are characters and design elements set against this backdrop, highlighting its uniformity. The white background provides a neutral canvas that enhances the visibility of the central elements. This consistency with common card design conventions further supports the assessment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the central illustration positioned centrally within the card, bounded by the rectangular frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the central illustration is enclosed within a rectangular frame that, relative to the card's dimensions, positions it centrally. This alignment is common in card design to create a balanced look. Comparing with Image A, which also positions the illustration similarly, affirms that Image B maintains this central positioning within the card space.",
