    "Question": "Q1: Are distinct horizontal sedimentary layers visible in the rock face of the cliff?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, there isn't any visible cliff with horizontal sedimentary layers because the image primarily features a fantasy-like creature. Sedimentary layers are geological formations typically seen in nature, especially on cliff faces or canyon walls, but they're absent since the focus is on the creature. Without any cliff present, the visual cues necessary to identify sedimentary layers cannot be discussed.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is there a bright, linear reflection of the sun visible on the water surface extending from the horizon?",
    "explanation": "The edited image is centered on an artistic rendition of a fantastical creature, without any visible water body. Without a sea, lake, or any body of water depicted in the scene, there cannot be a sun reflection on water.

    "Question": "Q4: Are shrubs and small trees growing along the upper edges and crevices of the cliff?",
    "explanation": "The edited image illustrates a fantastical creature without portraying a cliff with vegetation growing.

    "Question": "Q5: Are large, irregular boulders and grassy patches present in the foreground near the cliff edge?",

    "explanation": "The edited image revolves around a fantastical creature with no evident sun, horizon, sky, or water.
