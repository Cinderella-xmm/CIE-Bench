    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the man's left arm still wrapped around the woman's back, supporting her in a ballroom dance hold?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe the man in a traditional ballroom dance hold, which typically involves his left arm wrapped around the woman's back for support. The positioning of the couple and the visual cues of their posture suggest the continuation of this hold. This is consistent with typical ballroom dance posture, where the man's left arm supports the woman.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the woman's right hand remain on the man's left shoulder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's arm positioning appears to suggest that her right hand is resting on or near the man's left shoulder, a common posture in ballroom dancing for maintaining balance and connection. Her arm placement aligns with this typical positioning.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the woman's back arched backward with her right leg lifted off the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's position doesn't depict an arching of the back or elevation of her right leg. Instead, both dancers appear to be in an upright position, consistent with the initial steps or a stable pose in ballroom dance rather than a dramatized move requiring an arched back.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the man positioned with his back to the viewer while the woman faces slightly toward the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the man with his back to the viewer, while the woman's position suggests she is turning slightly towards the camera. The ballroom hold supports this orientation, as the man typically leads while the woman follows, often directing her gaze toward a different angle.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the woman's long blonde hair flow outward to the right side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's hair appears styled and not flowing outward. The ballroom setting and choreography often involve movement which may not be evident here, implying that her hair is controlled and styled, rather than flowing outward in a pronounced manner.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the man's left foot forward and the woman's right heel raised off the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the man's positioning suggests his left foot moves forward as part of the dance routine while the woman's stance shows her feet positioned for balance rather than with a heel raised, indicative of a classical dance pose where weight distribution is key.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the woman's head tilted upward with her eyes looking toward the upper left of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's head position suggests a typical graceful neck line essential in ballroom dances, but not specifically tilted upward with her gaze directed toward the upper left. Her posture and facial orientation do not show an upward tilt, indicating standard ballroom posture.",
