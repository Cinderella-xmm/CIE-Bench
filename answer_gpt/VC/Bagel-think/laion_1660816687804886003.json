      "question": "Is the circular logo featuring a navy blue \"C\" shape with a red semicircle at the top present on the front of the energy drink can?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the circular logo that is traditionally associated with Champion appears on the side of the shoe. There is no energy drink can visible in the image. Combining visual cues with world knowledge, sneakers typically do not feature energy drink branding. Thus, the circular logo's presence is confirmed on the sneaker itself, not an energy drink can.",

      "question": "Does the energy drink can feature the navy blue mesh texture across its main body surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a sneaker where navy blue mesh is part of its design. There is no energy drink can featured, and sneakers, unlike cans, often have textured surfaces, such as mesh, for ventilation. Therefore, the navy blue mesh is part of the sneakerâ€™s main body, not a can.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the navy blue laces depicted as raised embossed ridges wrapping around the middle section of the can in their original crisscross pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the navy blue laces appear on a sneaker and are arranged in a crisscross pattern typical for shoes. There is no energy drink can in the image, and such lace arrangements are characteristic of shoes, not cans. Thus, the crisscross laces are on the sneaker, not an energy drink can.",

      "question": "Are three navy blue stripes arranged horizontally across the lower portion of the can, matching the original shoe's stripe layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features three navy blue stripes on the sneaker, a common athletic brand design motif, particularly associated with Adidas. These stripes are on the sneaker itself, not on an energy drink can, as no such can is present in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the word \"Kickstart\" displayed in red lettering on the upper portion of the can?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'EQT' is shown in red lettering on the shoe. This marks the sneaker's design details, not associated with any can or beverage branding like 'Kickstart', which is unrelated to the context of sneakers. No energy drink can or its branding is present.",
