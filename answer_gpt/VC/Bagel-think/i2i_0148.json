      "question": "Are the two cars in the image identifiable as the same models shown in the original, with the same body shapes and design features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are distortion effects that dramatically change the appearance of the two cars. However, you can still identify the general body shapes and design features such as the tail lights, sedan shape, and distinctive features that are similar to the original cars shown in Image A. Despite the heavy editing and change in lighting, context clues and car familiarity allow recognition of them as the same models.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red traffic lights still visible above the cars, maintaining their original function as stop signals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the altered color scheme and increased saturation in Image B, the traffic lights are still prominently red, positioned above the cars. Their function as stop signals is unchanged as they remain in the correct location and are still illuminated, indicating their intended stop command.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the lane markings on the road clearly visible and consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lane markings have become less distinct due to increased saturation and contrast. While they appear more faded and less visible compared to Image A, they are still identifiable in terms of their placement and general pattern, though they're not as clear as in the original.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the colors have been dramatically altered, the structural outlines of the urban environment, trees, and roadside features are still visible. While the environment appears less natural due to artistic editing, these elements remain intact in terms of form and placement, consistent with what Image A shows.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both cars are depicted side by side in Image B, as in the original Image A. Despite the color and lighting alterations, the cars maintain their parallel positioning on the road, aligning with the same spatial orientation as shown in the original.",
