      "question": "Does the owl retain its brown and white spotted feather pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl is depicted as a Lego-style miniature figurine. This design predominantly features a smoother, non-detailed texture typical of Lego models, which eliminates the detailed patterns like the brown and white spotted feathers found in traditional drawings or animations. Given this smooth texture and the uniform color application in Lego figurines, the original feather details are essentially lost. Hence, the absence of intricate patterns in the Lego portrayal leads to the conclusion.",

      "question": "Are the owl's large yellow eyes and black beak present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl's eyes are visually seen but they are depicted with simple black pupils on a white background, common in Lego designs for eyes, instead of the large yellow eyes seen in more realistic owl drawings. As for the owl's beak, it is present but lacks the characteristic detail since it is simplified as part of the Lego style. Therefore, given that both the eyes and beak have simplified forms but are physically there, the interpretation is made accordingly.",

      "question": "Is the owl still wearing a graduation cap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl is wearing a graduation cap, which is consistent with the typical representation of a scholarly owl. The presence of this cap in the recognizable graduation style across both images suggests continuity in the depiction of the owl's academic theme.",

      "question": "Does the owl continue to hold the rolled-up diploma tied with a yellow ribbon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B show the owl holding a diploma, which is depicted as a scroll tied with a yellow ribbon. Even though Image B is a Lego version, the symbolic elements of the diploma remain visually understandable and are depicted holding firmly in the owl's one 'hand', thereby maintaining this characteristic from Image A.",

      "question": "Are there still three books stacked beneath the owl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, it is apparent that the owl figurine is enclosed within a display case, standing on a base. There are no visible books beneath it, unlike in Image A where the owl is clearly depicted sitting atop a stack of three books. This fundamental alteration in what the owl is positioned on leads to the determination regarding the number of books.",
