    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the green-shaded desk lamp present on the right side of the desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right side of the desk where a green-shaded desk lamp would typically be placed does not contain any visible lamp or distinct lighting source in that position. There is no recognizable structure resembling a desk lamp with a green shade, thereby indicating its absence.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the vertical window with a grid pattern visible on the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to be filled with bookshelves and a decorative frame surrounding the scene. Unlike Image A, which has a window with a grid pattern, there is no identifiable vertical window with such a design within Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there an open book with yellowed pages on the desk in front of the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The open book with yellowed pages is prominently displayed in front of the figure in Image B. The pages and the book's position on the desk, supported by a common environmental context seen in libraries or reading areas, support this conclusion.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are round wire-rimmed glasses visible on the figure’s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the area around the face and upper body is visible, there are no round wire-rimmed glasses observable. Given that glasses would typically fit and be seen on the upper half of the face, their absence in the visible facial region confirms they are not present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the figure seated at the desk with her body leaning forward toward the open book?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body posture suggests the figure is seated, as indicated by the alignment at the table's edge and the arm's positioning towards the book. The inclination of the body towards the book implies a forward-leaning posture commonly associated with reading.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the desk made of wood with visible grain texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The desk's appearance in Image B suggests a flat surface with no distinctive wood grain texture or clear wooden characteristics evident. The artistic style leans more towards a flat, less detailed representation, lacking the details of the wood grain shown in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there multiple stacked books located behind the main open book on the desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Behind the open book in Image B, there are additional books visible. These appear to be stacked in a similar fashion as those seen in a library or study environment, supporting the presence of multiple stacked books.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hairstyle suggests that the hair is styled neatly in a bun without loose strands evident along the face. No strands fall out of place, indicating a structured and neatly tied hairstyle.",
