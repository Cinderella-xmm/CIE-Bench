      "question": "Are the curved rockers at the base of the chair present and clearly defined?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a stylized illustration of a rocking chair. The illustration depicts the characteristic curved rockers at the base of the chair. These are stylized into a smooth and simple curved line typical of rockers in a general representation, showing the rockers are present and clearly defined. The visual information shows a continuous curve connecting to the legs, which is consistent with our knowledge of rocker chairs. Therefore, the illustrated image maintains the key features of a rocking chair, including the curved rockers.",

      "question": "Is the back of the chair composed of multiple vertical spindles arranged between the top and bottom rails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the back of the illustrated rocking chair is depicted with multiple vertical blue spindles arranged between a top rail and a bottom rail. These vertical elements are present, and their arrangement is similar to what is usually observed in traditional rocking chairs, where multiple spindles provide structural support and aesthetic appeal. Therefore, the answer based on Image B is that the back of the chair does have multiple vertical spindles.",

      "question": "Are the armrests curved and connected to the front legs with turned supports?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the armrests of the chair in a simplified manner. The armrests appear slightly curved in the illustration, reflecting a common design in rocking chairs. However, the connection to the front legs is indicated with simple lines rather than detailed turned supports, which is consistent with stylized or cartoonish representations that aim to convey the general structure rather than detailed craftsmanship. Hence, in a cartoonish sense, the armrests seem connected with an implied support structure to the front legs.",

      "question": "Are there spherical finials at the top of the two upright back posts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration shows the two upright back posts topped with distinctive spherical shapes, representing finials. These are common decorative elements on traditional rocking chairs, often used to add an aesthetically pleasing finish to the chair's design. The illustration emphasises these spherical forms, which are clearly intended to be finials similar to classic chair designs.",

      "question": "Does the chair maintain its original proportions, with a tall back, curved seat, and balanced leg structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustrated rocking chair maintains a simplified version of a classic chair proportion. It depicts a tall back with multiple spindles, a curved simple seat, and a balanced structure with rockers underneath. Although stylized, the illustration captures the essence of a rocking chairâ€™s proportions, adapted into a graphic form where all necessary elements reflect the typical structure of a rocking chair with a tall backrest and a balanced design.",

      "question": "Are the rockers directly connected to the front legs, forming a continuous curved base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the illustrated representation of the rocking chair in Image B, the rockers are shown as continuous curved lines that are directly connected to the front legs. This visual cue is indicative of a typical rocking chair design where the rockers form the base and contribute to the chair's ability to rock. The cartoonish depiction still follows the logic of traditional chair construction, where the rockers create a stable base connected to the legs.",
