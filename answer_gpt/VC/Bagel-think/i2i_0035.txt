    "Question": "Q1: Does the image retain the visible cheese texture and layered shape of the chicken parmesan?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the area where a chicken parmesan dish is placed shows heavy alteration with noticeable pixelation and added text, which distorts the texture and layers of the dish. The once smooth texture and defined form of melted cheese are replaced with strong outlines and modification artifacts that obscure the original details. Therefore, the visible cheese texture and layered shape are not retained.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the salad presented with discernible leafy green textures?",
    "explanation": "Image B has been altered to a significant degree where colors are intensified and borders are added. The salad area within Image B shows strong pixelation and over-processing, which disrupts the original leafy textures. While green tones are present, the discernible textures typical of a fresh salad have been degraded, making them less recognizable.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the milk carton still placed behind the salad?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, due to alteration with added text and border effects, the spatial arrangement between the milk carton and the salad is difficult to discern clearly. The milk carton is still visible, but its relative position to the salad might be obscured by the heavy editing. In Image A, the milk carton appears directly behind the salad, but Image B does not preserve this spatial clarity effectively.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the semi-circular orange slices with visible internal segments retained?",
    "explanation": "The edit applied to Image B distorts the clarity that is usually associated with fresh fruit. While the overall shape and color are recognizable as oranges, the internal segments that define the natural semi-circular slice pattern are pixelated to the point of losing their detailed texture.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the image retain the white plate against the orange tablecloth background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the white plate and the orange tablecloth are subjected to a filtering effect that modifies their appearance. While the plate is still recognizable and outlined, the strong border and alteration effect change the initial contrast and natural color presentation seen in Image A. Thus, while some elements are retained, their original clarity and appearance have been significantly altered in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
