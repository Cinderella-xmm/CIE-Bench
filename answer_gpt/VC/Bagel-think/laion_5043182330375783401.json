      "question": "Is the mustache present and clearly defined above the upper lip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual style is highly abstract and geometric, with bold lines and flat colors. A mustache, traditionally, would be represented with a distinct line or color patch above the upper lip. However, due to the blurred face, it is impossible to ascertain the presence of a mustache. Thus, based on the available information and the abstract representation, the most logical conclusion is that a mustache is not clearly defined in this style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both eyes closed in the facial expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the abstract style and color blocks do not show detailed facial features, such as eyes. The blurred region makes it impossible to distinguish facial expressions, so both eyes cannot be definitively stated as closed based on the given image.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the figure’s right arm resting on the back of the chair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The abstract rendering in Image B uses colors and geometric shapes to interpret the figure's posture. The right arm appears to be bent and might suggest resting on something, but the lack of a discernible chair makes it unclear if it's on the back of a chair. In this abstract representation, it is difficult to confirm the arm's resting position clearly.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is depicted using geometric shapes, suggesting posture and alignment typical of a seated position. The triangular formations and overall alignment of the body parts give an impression consistent with sitting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration lacks any discernible numbers or text, including the number '27826,' particularly in the bottom right corner or elsewhere. The abstract style focuses purely on the figure without additional elements like numbers.",
