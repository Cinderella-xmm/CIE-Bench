      "question": "Do both players retain identifiable clothing (white shirts and shorts, white tank top with black bottoms) and hairstyles in the chibi version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi characters clearly reflect the clothing style of the players in Image A. The player on the left wears a white shirt and dark shorts, while the player on the right is in a white tank top and black bottoms, similar to their real counterparts. Their hairstyles also match closely, with one player having tied back hair and the other having a ponytail. This resemblance in clothing and hairstyle demonstrates that both players retain identifiable features in the chibi rendition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both players still holding tennis rackets in the chibi rendition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts both chibi characters holding tennis rackets in their hands, similar to Image A where both players are holding rackets. This retention of rackets in the chibi version mirrors the real-life scenario where tennis players would typically hold their rackets, indicating a continued representation of equipment related to their sport.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the handshake pose still maintained between the two chibi players over the net?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the chibi characters in a pose where they face each other and are shaking hands, just as the players do in Image A across the tennis net. Although the depiction is stylized, the handshake posture reflects the same interaction present in the original image, indicating that the gesture is preserved in the edited version.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are tennis balls and the net still present in the foreground and middle ground respectively?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the chibi characters maintain the central handshake gesture, the net continues to be a central part of the composition as indicated by the stylized representation behind them. However, tennis balls are not explicitly depicted in this version; therefore, the retention is partial.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the background still depict an outdoor tennis court or at least retain visual hints of it (e.g., court lines, fencing)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B transforms the realistic tennis court environment into a stylized design, which does not directly depict court lines or fencing. Instead, it features a background with emblematic patterns which do not resemble an outdoor tennis court as seen in Image A. Hence, visual hints of a tennis court are not retained in the chibi version.",
