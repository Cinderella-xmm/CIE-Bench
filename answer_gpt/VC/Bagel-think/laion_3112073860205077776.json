      "question": "Is the golden-brown crust of the pie slice present with visible crumbly texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pie slice exhibits a golden-brown crust along the edges. This hue suggests the crust has been baked, as it is commonly known that baking gives a crust a golden color due to caramelization of sugars and Maillard reaction. The visible texture suggests crumblyness, which is typical for pie crusts.",
