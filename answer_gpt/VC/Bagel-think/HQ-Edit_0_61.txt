    "Question": "Q1: Is the shoji screen window with its grid of wooden frames and translucent paper panels present and unchanged?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on a boxed tea set design with embossed leaf patterns and a teapot illustration. There is no evidence of any shoji screen window with wooden frames or paper panels in the image. The design seems more focused on packaging rather than an interior setting. In Image A, the shoji screen window is clearly visible as part of a traditional setting. Therefore, there is a significant change regarding the presence of the shoji screen.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the tatami mats with their woven texture and green border lines visible and unaltered?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases a textured packaging design with an embedded teapot and leaf, but lacks any features resembling tatami mats with their distinctive woven texture and green borders typically found in traditional Japanese interiors. In Image A, these mats are clear elements of the setting, thus showing that they are absent in the edited image.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the potted maple tree with bright red and yellow leaves visible in the upper right corner of the scene?",
    "explanation": "Image B has a packaging design with a central teapot and leaf motif, flanked by embossed leaf patterns but does not depict any potted maple tree. In Image A, the potted tree with vivid autumnal colors is part of the traditional setting. Thus, Image B is absent of such a tree.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the warm, diffused golden light coming through the shoji screen visible, creating soft shadows and highlights on the objects and floor?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not feature lighting effects typical of a room setting. Instead, it focuses on packaging design with consistent coloring and embossing.

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the tea tray placed centrally in front of the shoji screen, facing the autumnal view outside?",
    "explanation": "Image B is concentrated on a boxed design rather than a room setup containing furniture like a tea tray. In Image A, the tray is central to the composition, positioned with relation to the shoji screen and autumnal view. Therefore, the tray is absent in the edited image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is a blurred autumn forest with red and orange trees visible through the shoji screen in the background?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not provide any view through a window, neither blurred nor otherwise. It is focused wholly on a decorative box design.
