    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the plaid pattern (with red, blue, and black intersecting lines) on the left tie preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plaid pattern on the tie is visible with clear intersecting lines of red, blue, and black. This distinct pattern is easily recognizable due to its vibrant and contrasting colors. Thus, the plaid pattern on the left tie is indeed preserved.",

      "question": "Is the green and yellow bear-shaped emblem on the right tie preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there appears to be no visible detail representing a bear-shaped emblem on the tie. Without any identifiable marking or shape suggesting this emblem, it can be concluded that this detail is not preserved in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are both ties preserved in their original necktie shape (narrow, tapered, diagonal across the chest)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both ties are drawn in a narrow, tapered design, extending diagonally across the figures' chests. This shape is characteristic of typical neckties, suggesting that both ties maintain their original shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure wearing the plaid tie is situated on the left side, and while there is no bear-shaped emblem visible on the right side figure, the context implies the intended position of the characters follows their original places in Image A. Thus, the figure with the emblem would logically be on the right side.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is depicted as a grassy field with visible greenery, consistent with an outdoor scene. The green vegetation is drawn to extend into the distance, matching the description of the surroundings.",
