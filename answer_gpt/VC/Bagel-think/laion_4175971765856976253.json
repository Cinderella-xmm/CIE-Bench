      "question": "Is the horseshoe-shaped grille with central mesh present on the front of the car and on the robot’s face/torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car features what appears to be a horseshoe-shaped grille at its front, which is a distinct design element often associated with luxury sports cars. Similarly, the robot's torso and face also have a similar design element that resembles the grille with a central mesh pattern, aligning with the car's design. This design choice creates a visual continuity between the car form and the robot form. Therefore, based on these observations, it's concluded that both the car and robot in Image B indeed have this horseshoe-shaped grille.",

      "question": "Are the side panels, front bumper, and door sections red, and the roof, hood, and lower body black?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B of the edited image, the car displays a two-tone color scheme where the visible portions of the side panels, front bumper, and door sections are red. Meanwhile, the roof, hood, and parts of the lower body of the car are black. This distinct paint scheme characterizes the car's appearance as sporty and modern. The robot, derived from the car, also follows these color patterns. This overall scheme is consistent with the question's description.",

      "question": "Do both the car and robot feature five-spoke silver wheels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the car and the robot both have wheels with a five-spoke design, which is a common style for sports cars and has a practical as well as aesthetic appeal. The color of these wheels is silver, which contrasts sharply against the black and red tones of the car and robot bodies, adding to the visual appeal and suggesting premium quality. These observations confirm the presence of five-spoke silver wheels on both the car and robot.",

      "question": "Does the robot have gold-colored segmented armor plates on its chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot features distinctly colored areas on its chest that resemble segmented armor plates. These areas exhibit a gold color, standing out against the darker tones of the robot's body. Such design choices are typical in robot designs to suggest robustness and a futuristic appearance, enhancing the robot's style and thematic intention. Hence, it's confirmed that the robot possesses gold-colored segmented armor plates on its chest.",

      "question": "Are the robot’s arms formed from the car’s doors and fenders, and its legs from the car’s wheels and undercarriage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the transformation from car to robot form, a typical characteristic of transformable toys. The parts used to form the robot's arms appear to originate from the car's doors and fenders, while the legs seem to be constructed from sections akin to the car's wheels and undercarriage. This transformation logic echoes the mechanics of transforming toys, ensuring that the robot’s limbs are a direct continuation of the car's components.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second image, the arrangement presented shows one of the robot figures and one of the cars positioned respectively such that it appears the car is placed in front of the robot, with the robot standing behind in an upright position. This setup is visually apparent and reflects the ordered composition typically used to showcase both forms of the toy in promotional images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the car and robot exhibit various color themes, including red, black, and gold, there are no visible white stripes observed on the front bumper and side panels of the car, or on the robot’s shoulders and face. Their design primarily involves bold black and red segments without white accents, indicating a streamlined and cohesive color scheme lacking in white striping.",
