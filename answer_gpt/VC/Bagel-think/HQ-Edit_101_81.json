        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's lifted foot is placed against the inner thigh of her standing leg. This position is indicative of the 'Tree Pose' in yoga, where the foot is placed on the inner thigh or calf of the opposite leg. The visual cue is clear as the foot is clearly pressing against the standing leg's inner thigh.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's hands are pressed together in a traditional prayer position directly above her head. This is a common posture for certain yoga poses and religious practices, where the palms are joined and fingers point upwards.",

      "question": "Is the woman standing on a flat rectangular yoga mat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible yoga mat underneath the woman. She appears to be standing on an ornate, circular design on the ground, which does not resemble a flat rectangular yoga mat.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's feet are visible and she is not wearing any footwear. This is typical in yoga practices where practitioners are often barefoot for better grip and connection to the ground.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For privacy reasons, the face in Image B is blurred, making it impossible to visually determine if the eyes are closed or if the face is relaxed. However, in typical yoga poses, it is common to have closed eyes for concentration and relaxation, but this cannot be confirmed due to the blurring.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's body appears to be upright and balanced, which is a characteristic of proper yoga posture in poses like the Tree Pose. She is centered over where she stands, and there is no visible leaning to either side.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's arms are extended upwards with the elbows appearing straight. The palms are touching each other, which indicates that her arms are in a fully extended position typical of a proper Tree Pose.",
