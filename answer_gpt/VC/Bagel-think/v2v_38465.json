      "question": "Is the sunset visible on the horizon with its reflection on the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunset is prominently visible on the horizon, as indicated by the bright circular light source in the sky. Its reflection is also noticeable on the surface of the ocean, capturing the warm gradient of colors stretching towards the sandy beach. Using common sense, we understand that such lighting and reflection patterns are typical of a sunset scene.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the sandy beach retain its texture and extend across the bottom of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandy beach is visible at the bottom of the image, maintaining its natural texture. There is a visible gradient of the sand which appears consistent and uninterrupted across the image. This observation is based on the typical appearance of sand in beach photography, which should have a granular texture.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ocean waves present, showing natural movement near the shore?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ocean waves are depicted in the background near the shore, identifiable by the wavy patterns and color gradient on the water. These features suggest movement, consistent with typical representations of waves nearing a shore in sunset beach photography, where the ocean showcases dynamic textural changes due to wave motion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the surfboards retain their original colors (yellow on the left, red and teal on the right) and upright positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the surfboards are both present in upright positions and maintain the same color scheme as the original. The left surfboard remains yellow, and the right surfboard is red and teal. This consistency in color and orientation suggests no edit has been made to these particular attributes from the original image configuration.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the pandas positioned similarly to the original humans, with one arm holding the surfboard and both facing the sunset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures have been altered to depict pandas instead of humans. However, they are positioned to mirror the original pose: holding the surfboards with one arm and facing the sunset, emulating the original scene's composition. This consistency indicates a focus on maintaining the thematic elements of the original image while altering the figures' identities.",
