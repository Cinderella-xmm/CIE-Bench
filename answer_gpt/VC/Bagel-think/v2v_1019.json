      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the character’s body retain the cylindrical shape and reddish-brown color of the original hot dogs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is an anthropomorphic figure with limbs and rounded features, which differs from the cylindrical form seen in hot dogs from Image A. The body is a flesh tone resembling skin rather than reddish-brown like the hot dogs, indicating a departure from the original color and shape. Combining this observation with common knowledge of character design, the cylindrical shape and color of the hot dogs is not retained in the character's body design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the character’s hair incorporate the shredded texture of white, orange, and purple cabbage from the original coleslaw?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character with strands of hair on its head resembling finely shredded white, orange, and purple elements, mimicking the visual appearance of coleslaw from Image A. Knowledge of how cabbage is visually processed validates the observable shredded texture in Image B as matching the coleslaw.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the decorative border of the plate, featuring teal blue, burnt orange, and dark brown floral and scroll motifs, present in the base design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the plates feature similar decorative borders with teal blue, burnt orange, and dark brown floral and scroll motifs. Analyzing the color schemes and patterns, the plate design in Image B retains these specific floral and scroll motifs found in Image A. This demonstrates continuity of design between the two images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the character positioned on a base that visually derives from the original plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character positioned on a plate exhibiting the same design elements observed in Image A, including the decorative edge with floral and scroll motifs. Visual similarity of the positioning and style indicates that Image B features the character on a base derived from the original plate design seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the character represent two hot dogs, either through dual bodies or mirrored features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B appears singular with one body encased by a bun and adorned with coleslaw-like hair, unlike the two separate hot dogs found in Image A. Observing this character and bun merging into one figure means it does not represent two hot dogs through any doubled features. World knowledge about character representation supports the singularity of the design seen.",
