      "question": "Is the dark, glossy texture of the chocolate sauce preserved in the sneaker design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sneaker exhibits elements of gloss, particularly noticeable in the shiny areas around the laces and sides, which mimic the reflective quality of chocolate sauce as seen in Image A. This visual cue suggests an intentional design choice to mimic the chocolate sauce's glossy texture.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sneaker in Image B has a structured and solid design, without any indication of flowing or pooling patterns akin to the chocolate sauce in Image A. The sauce has a liquid characteristic that spreads out, whereas the sneaker maintains a uniform shape.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sneaker design is characterized by its smooth and sleek lines, contrasting with the ruffled and organic texture of the lettuce in Image A. There is no visible use of ruffled patterns or contours on the sneaker.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sneaker appears to have elements of reflectivity, particularly in certain glossy plates on its design, much like the reflective quality observed in the chocolate sauce in Image A. This suggests that the reflective surface inspired by the chocolate sauce is maintained.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sneaker predominantly features dark, chocolate-like shades and textures without any hint of green or elements resembling lettuce. Therefore, there is no contrast between chocolate and lettuce-inspired elements present.",
