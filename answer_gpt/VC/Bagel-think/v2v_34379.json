      "question": "Are the broccoli florets in both dishes still composed of distinct tree-like branching structures with dark green crowns and lighter green stems?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the broccoli florets maintain their typical structure, consisting of a dark green crown with lighter green stems. This observation is informed by recognizing the typical appearance of broccoli, which resembles small trees and is characterized by branching structures. Although a direct comparison to Image A would confirm this, solely from Image B, the tree-like form is apparent. Therefore, the broccoli in both dishes retains its structure.",

      "question": "Do the cauliflower florets retain their compact, rounded, and textured white clusters regardless of size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows cauliflower florets with their classic appearance: compact, rounded clusters that are white in color. This is based on world knowledge of how cauliflower typically presents, with a dense texture and uniform coloration. Although a comparison with Image A could further illustrate size differences, the essential features of cauliflower are preserved in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the vegetables in the left dish still bright green (broccoli) and creamy white (cauliflower), without any browning or charring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the vegetables in the left dish as retaining bright green coloration for the broccoli and creamy white for the cauliflower. These colors are typical for fresh, uncooked versions of these vegetables. There is no visual indication of browning or charring in Image B, corroborated by the knowledge of how fresh vegetables appear.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the vegetables in the right dish still exhibit golden-brown caramelization and dark charred edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From observing Image B, the vegetables in the right dish do not appear to exhibit golden-brown caramelization or dark charred edges. Instead, they resemble the uncooked vegetables from the left dish, which suggests a lack of roasting characteristic. This observation contrasts with the visual cues and common knowledge of cooked vegetables, which typically show browning from heat exposure.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are both dishes identical in shape—rectangular with two handles at the top and bottom—and made of white ceramic material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both dishes in Image B have a rectangular shape with handles on the top and bottom, typical of many casserole or baking dishes. The material appears to be white ceramic, as seen in the visual cues and based on common pottery materials used in kitchenware. Comparison with Image A would corroborate this observation, but independently, Image B does show these features consistently.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is indeed a light brown wooden surface with visible wood grain patterns arranged horizontally. This observation aligns with the common appearance of wood surfaces, which are frequently used for tabletops. Comparing with Image A would validate the consistency, but Image B alone provides clear visual evidence of these details.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dish on the left contains raw vegetables, while the dish on the right contains vegetables resembling those in the left dish, indicating no roasting has taken place in Image B. This positions them counter to the expectation of left for raw, right for roasted, based not only on appearance but also typical positioning logic.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any visible seasoning specks or browning marks inside the right dish around the vegetables. Instead, the dish mimics the appearance of raw vegetables visible elsewhere. Browning or seasoning would typically signal some form of cooking process or seasoning step, not evident here.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears to be evenly distributed from above as there are minimal shadows cast under the dishes and vegetables. This effect is common in photography or tabletop imagery where balanced lighting highlights the subject matter equally. Image A comparison would further confirm this, but Image B's visual cues clearly suggest uniform lighting.",
