      "question": "Does the edited image show the octopus with exactly eight tentacles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration style simplifies details compared to a realistic depiction and shows an octopus with distinct tentacles. By counting the tentacles visually depicted in a stylized cartoon format, one can ascertain their number. The stylized octopus has eight tentacles, a common trait in this creature, which aligns with world knowledge of octopuses generally having eight tentacles.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there two distinct, large eyes visible on the octopus’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a stylized octopus with circular features indicative of eyes. There are two such features positioned on the head, common in octopus illustrations. The presence of two eyes is consistent with the basic anatomical structure of an octopus, which typically has two prominent eyes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are suction cups visible along the underside of at least some of the octopus’s tentacles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes a stylized and simplified illustration technique that abstracts many details, such as suction cups, commonly found on the underside of octopus tentacles in realistic portrayals. Here, the tentacles lack clear suction cup detail, emphasizing stylization over realism.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the octopus positioned on or adjacent to the beach, with part of its body in the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration depicts the octopus in proximity to what seems to be a shoreline. The stylized depiction includes waves and a beach landscape near the octopus. Given that the choice and placement of elements imply a setting near a beach, and considering typical octopus habitats, the scene suggests adjacency to the beach.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the octopus clearly the largest and most prominent figure in the image, facing directly toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the octopus dominates the scene, its size and central position making it the most noticeable aspect of the illustration. Its face, looking toward the viewer, is a typical stylized feature in such illustrations to create engagement and emphasis, supporting that the octopus is the most prominent figure.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a visible stretch of sandy beach meeting the ocean water in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a simplified depiction where a sandy beach is implied by color and form; however, distinct sandy textures or grains meeting ocean water might not be finely detailed due to the illustrative approach. The sense of beach meeting ocean is present in the lower part of the image through simplified linear elements indicative of shoreline.",
