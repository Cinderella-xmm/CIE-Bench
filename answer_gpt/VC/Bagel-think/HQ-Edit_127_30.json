      "question": "Are the two symmetrical f-hole shapes present on the body of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual examination reveals a violin-like object, but the traditional f-hole shapes are replaced with decorative text. Typically, a violin features two f-hole cuts for sound emission on its surface, symmetrically positioned on either side of the strings. However, the absence of these shapes in the edited image leads to the conclusion that these are not present.",

      "question": "Is the scroll with four tuning pegs located at the top end of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object retains some violin-like elements, such as the scroll at the top end, which plays a key role in string tuning. By visually examining the topmost part of the structure, the scroll and the four tuning pegs typical of violins are identifiable.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the object retain the classic violin silhouette with distinct upper and lower bouts and a central waist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B appears to maintain the general contour of a violin. Typically, a violin's shape includes an hourglass figure with curvatures forming the upper bout, lower bout, and a narrow central waist where the shoulders and hips taper. This standard shape is discernible in the image, indicating the retention of the classic silhouette.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a clearly defined bridge area located between the two f-holes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bridge of a violin is normally located between the two f-holes on the body of the instrument, serving to support the strings. In Image B, while there is mention of some violin-like structure, the lack of defined f-holes in this edited image makes it unclear where a distinct bridge area might be present, particularly since the place where the bridge would typically stand is covered by decorative elements.",

      "question": "Is the object positioned diagonally across the support surface, with the scroll pointing toward the upper right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the object placed at a diagonal angle on the surface, with the end resembling the scroll of a violin directed towards the upper right corner. This matches the typical orientation for displaying a similar object in such imagery.",
