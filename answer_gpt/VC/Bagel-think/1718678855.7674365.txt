{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the capybara have four limbs visible or implied by posture?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, while only two limbs are explicitly visible due to the front-facing posture, the presence and posture imply the existence of four limbs typical for a quadrupedal creature like a capybara. Such implication aligns with the natural anatomy of capybaras.",
    "answer": "Yes"
