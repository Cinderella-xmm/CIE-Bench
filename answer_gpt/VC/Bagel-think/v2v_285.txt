    "Question": "Q1: Is the large tree trunk with textured bark positioned on the left side of the image, partially obscuring the rear wheel of the bicycle?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a stylized, cartoonish aesthetic with vibrant colors. On the left side of the image, there is a tree trunk, but it does not exhibit textured bark in the way a realistic tree would. Instead, it has a smooth appearance consistent with its animated style. The tree trunk does not obscure the bicycle's rear wheel; the wheel is fully visible. Therefore, despite the animated nature, the tree trunk is plainly clear and does not cause any obstruction.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the bicycle make direct contact with the tree trunk, leaning against it on its left side?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycle is prominently placed in front of the tree trunk but it is not in direct contact with it. The stylization in the image gives a sense of separation between the tree and the bike, consistent with its playful and vibrant theme, where the bicycle stands independently rather than leaning on the tree.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a continuous road stretching from the foreground into the background, aligned horizontally across the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a path visible, but it is not aligned horizontally. The path starts from the bottom right and curves towards the background, which aligns with a winding road rather than a horizontal straight road. This path complements the overall whimsical setting of the animation style.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there exactly three motorcyclists riding in a straight line along the road in the background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, instead of motorcyclists, there are four cartoonish characters riding bicycles or similar vehicles. These characters are placed along the path at different intervals, not in a straight line. The whimsical nature of the image emphasizes variety and playfulness, thus not arranging them in a conventional straight line.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the bicycle located on the left side of the image, with the road and motorcyclists positioned to the right and extending into the distance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycle is clearly on the left side, while the path (representing the road) curves from the lower right into the background. There are characters (not motorcyclists) located along this path, characterized in a playful style, indicating they are moving into the distance. This composition maintains the bicycle on the left with the activity occurring towards the right, leading into the background.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the rear wheel of the bicycle partially obscured by the tree trunk?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the rear wheel of the bicycle is not obscured by the tree. The entire bicycle, including both of its wheels, is fully visible. The tree is in close proximity but does not hide any part of the bicycle. This reflects the art's focus on clarity and vibrancy rather than obstruction.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is there a round headlight mounted on the front fork of the bicycle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycle has a stylized look and does feature a round element on the front fork that can be interpreted as a headlight. The intentional design choice in a playful setting suggests a simplified, round headlight present on the bicycle.",
    "answer": "Yes"
