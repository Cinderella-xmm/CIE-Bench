        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, based on the visual cues, there is no presence of a bike or its frame. Instead, there is a logo with a turquoise background. Since there is no bike frame visible, it cannot be determined to be red or any other color.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, no bike or bicycle components such as a rear rack are visible. The only visible element is a logo against a turquoise background, making it impossible to ascertain the presence of a rear rack.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not feature a bike or its interaction with any object like a wooden log, as it contains a graphic logo on a turquoise background. Thus, there is no depiction of a bike leaning against anything.",
