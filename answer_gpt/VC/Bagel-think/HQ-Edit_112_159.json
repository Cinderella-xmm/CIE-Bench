      "question": "Does the car retain the distinctive angular LED headlights and central grille intake characteristic of the McLaren 720S?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car is displayed as a model within a glass display case. It has distinctive angular LED headlights and a central grille intake, which are typical features of a McLaren supercar, similar to the McLaren 720S. Although it's a miniature model, these features are visually evident and hold true to the characteristics of the mentioned car. Analyzing Image A, the car depicted is a real supercar with the same distinctive features, confirming that Image B retains these design elements through its model representation.",

      "question": "Is the road still a curved two-lane highway with continuous double yellow lines running down its center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the road within the glass case model is depicted with a slight curve, resembling a two-lane highway. However, due to the miniature nature of the model, the details such as double yellow lines might not be as pronounced or visible compared to Image A, which shows a real road with clear continuous double yellow lines. The model representation suggests the notion of a highway but may not explicitly show all details like the double lines, as would be visible in life-size context.",

      "question": "Is the left-hand hillside still present with its reddish-brown slopes and scattered autumnal vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass display case contains a background depicting a hillside. The hillside has reddish-brown slopes with what seems to be scattered vegetation, suggesting an autumnal landscape. This resembles the larger, more detailed hillside seen in Image A, indicating that the concept of a reddish-brown, vegetated hillside is retained in the miniature model.",

      "question": "Is there a concrete guardrail along the right side of the road, separating it from the ocean?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the road within the glass model seems to have the suggestion of a barrier on its side, aligned with the background imagery. In Image A, a concrete guardrail is more prominent, separating the road and ocean. The miniature model simplifies these details, but the essence of a separation is present, indicating a reflective element of the original scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the car positioned centrally on the right side of the road, facing forward toward the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car model inside the glass case is positioned in such a way that it appears to be on the road, facing forward, but it does not specify which side it is on due to the viewing angle. In Image A, the car is centrally positioned on the right side of the road, facing the viewer directly as it moves toward the horizon. The angle and layout in the model may not distinctly show whether the car is specifically on the right side or in a central position in terms of lanes.",

      "question": "Are rocky outcrops visible in the distant sea, with mist or spray rising near the shore?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, within the miniature landscape depicted in the glass display case, there are small representations of rocky formations in the sea as part of the background scene. This suggests the concept of rocky outcrops. In Image A, real-life rocky outcrops and sea spray are more visible, but the model captures this essence by including similar themes in its miniature representation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car model inside the glass case is detailed enough to show the interior features, including the red racing seats with black accents, viewed through the windshield. These are observable despite the scaled-down nature, reflecting the design elements visible in Image A, where such seating is characteristic of a high-performance sports car.",
