    "Question": "Q4: Is the palm tree positioned to the left of the cactus and taller than it?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the palm tree appears behind a frame held in a hand with digital artwork on it. Within this artwork, the placement and comparison typical to the original natural setup from Image A is not directly represented; hence, the question does not apply as the context is different.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the palm fronds primarily green in color, with some yellowing or browning at the edges?",
    "explanation": "The fronds of the palm tree in Image B are primarily green without signs of yellowing or browning at the edges. This differs from natural palm trees where some aging or drying might be visible, indicating this depiction remains idealistically green.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the palm tree maintain a tall, narrow trunk with a broad, rounded crown of fronds?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a palm tree with a stylized form where the trunk is depicted narrow and the crown of fronds appears broad creating a rounded effect. This maintains the general iconic silhouette of natural palm trees.",
