      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we can see that the elderly man has white hair. While the face is blurred, based on the visible hair color, we can reasonably infer that the man likely has a cohesive hair appearance that includes a mustache. World knowledge about elderly men typically having matching hair and mustache colors supports this inference.",
