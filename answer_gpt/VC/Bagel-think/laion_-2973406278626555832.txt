    "Question": "Q1: Is the transparent tank section of the vape device clearly visible, allowing the internal liquid to be seen?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the transparent tank section of the device is shown with a visible liquid level, supported by artistic illustration. This depiction allows the viewer to observe the inner contents, such as liquid, through the transparent section of the vape device.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the black mouthpiece and cap at the top of the vape device present and correctly positioned?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the black mouthpiece and cap are depicted at the top of the vape device. Despite the stylized interpretation, the position is consistent with the device's normal structure and function, showing the user's interaction with it.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the coil component located at the base of the device, visible through the transparent tank?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the coil component is not explicitly depicted nor visible through the illustrated transparent section of the tank. The illustration does not show internal coil details, focusing instead on other parts of the device.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the liquid inside the transparent tank clearly visible and present at a measurable level?",
    "explanation": "The illustrated Image B shows liquid inside the transparent tank with sufficient detail to indicate a measurable level, using visual elements that demonstrate the presence and quantity of liquid.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the internal components (coil, liquid, battery) arranged in a logically consistent vertical alignment within the device?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while the stylization implies an arrangement of internal components, it does not present a clear logical vertical alignment of coil, liquid, and battery within the device. The arrangement lacks structural coherence typically expected in such devices.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is an airflow pathway indicated or implied in the deviceâ€™s structure, such as an inlet near the base?",
    "explanation": "Image B's illustration does not indicate or imply any particular airflow pathway or inlet near the base of the device. The depiction focuses more on artistic expression rather than technical detail about the airflow system.",
    "answer": "No"
