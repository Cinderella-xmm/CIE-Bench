      "question": "Is the white cougar logo visible on the red helmet of the player in maroon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the player's helmet in maroon is visible. Normally, sports teams often have logos or symbols on their helmets to represent their team, and a white cougar logo is typical for certain teams. Within the context of common sports attire and recognizing team symbols, it appears that there is a logo on the helmet. However, it's difficult to assert the logo's visibility due to the stylized nature of Image B without a clear depiction of distinctive features. Therefore, based on my reasoning, it's reasonable to conclude: No.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a player in white with a black helmet, typical of sports gear attire where logos are prominently displayed. Yellow 'C' with bear silhouettes are often representative of a specific team. Notably, in Image B, the stylization does not show detailed features such as a 'C' symbol or bear silhouette visibly on the helmet. Thus, based on visual cues and understanding of sports logos, the answer lies: No.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, detailed depiction of a sports jersey is stylized, which includes commonly featured jersey numbers. From the visible stylization, understanding that jerseys typically display numbers, the depiction indicates number identification. However, upon closer review, Image B does not prominently show a number '24' on the back of the maroon jersey, as per typical visibility arrangements. Hence: Yes.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, analyzing sports activity context, players in action often hold footballs. The stylized illustration shows the maroon-dressed player in an active stance, depicting traditional football scenes. The presence and hold of a discernible football are inherent to sports illustrations therein. Therefore, confirming visibility through depicted cues: Yes.",
