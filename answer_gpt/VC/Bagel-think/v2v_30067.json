      "question": "Is the clock face present with Roman numerals I through XII arranged in a circle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face is prominently visible and features Roman numerals in a circular arrangement. This is a characteristic design often seen in traditional clock faces, indicating an ability to convey time universally. By analyzing the visible numerals, wherein the sequence from I to XII can be distinguished, it's confirmed that the arrangement is complete and correct.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the clock face located directly above the central arched opening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face is situated directly above the central arch that forms an opening in the tower. This positioning is a design choice frequently seen in tower clock architectures, where the clock is often placed above significant architectural features such as entrances or large openings. The positioning is confirmed through visual observation of the clock's proximity over the arch.",

      "question": "Does the top of the tower feature a pointed gable with finials at each corner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the tower shows a gable that appears pointed, aligning with a typical architectural style choice to add character and detail. At each corner of the tower top, small decorative elements, identifiable as finials, provide visual interest. The pointed shape serves as a common aesthetic in older and historic tower designs, enhancing the overall impression.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there two arched windows on the left and right sides of the tower, positioned symmetrically below the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower does have a design that includes windows below the clock face, however, they are not fully symmetrical as one side shows visible damage, affecting its comparative path of symmetry. The analysis recognizes the presence of windows but determines their symmetry based on uniform placement relative to each other and the clock face. Thus, the visible damage alters the symmetry perception.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the undamaged stone surface of the tower uniformly light gray with visible cracks and rough texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone surface of the tower, while light gray, showcases visible roughness and cracks consistently across the structure where the surface is intact. This depiction highlights the historical and aged nature of the tower, suggesting wear and tear typical of such constructions. The described texture is evident in both its coloration and tactile impression.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there an intact arched opening directly above the clock face, forming a decorative frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, directly above the clock face, the imagery does not show an intact arched opening that might form any decorative frame. Instead, the observed features are not a single intact arch but the overall top structure extending upwards. The analysis indicates that the space above the clock does not contribute to further decorative arch detailing as suggested.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the tower maintain a tall, narrow vertical profile with distinct horizontal divisions at the base, middle, and top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a tower with a markedly tall and narrow vertical profile, characteristic of clock towers intended to stand prominently in their environment. The tower's structure shows distinct horizontal divisions that are identifiable at various sections - the base, middle, and top. These divisions add architectural rhythm and visual complexity, confirming a design typical for such constructions.",
