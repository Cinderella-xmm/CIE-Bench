      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image preserve the concentric spiral structure of the staircase, with steps forming progressively smaller rings as they descend toward the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spiral structure of the staircase is clearly visible, as the steps are arranged in a descending concentric pattern towards a central point. This characteristic is typical of spiral staircases, where steps diminish in size as they wind downwards. The visual cues in Image B, showing the circular and repetitive nature of the steps, are definitive evidence of the preserved structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the parallel rectangular shadows cast across the steps by sunlight still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows distinct patches of light and shadow across the steps, indicating the presence of parallel shadows, likely cast by sunlight. The shadows are rectangular and angled, consistent with shadows formed by window frames or similar structures. This pattern matches the description of shadows in a well-lit stairway environment.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a dark circular void at the center of the spiral, representing the bottom of the staircase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom center of the spiral staircase appears as a dark circle, which visually represents the void or termination point of the stairs. This feature is a common characteristic of spiral staircases where the central area is usually devoid of steps and can appear as a darkened pit or opening.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the handrail remain aligned along the outer edge of the spiral, following the same curvature as the steps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handrail is visible following the outermost edge of the staircase, maintaining the spiral's natural curve. Despite the artistic reinterpretation to have a textured, scale-like appearance, the handrail continues to mirror the curvature of the spiral shape of the steps, matching the typical alignment for safety and aesthetic in staircases.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the stone steps still visible with their original texture, including faint veining and minor surface imperfections, even if reinterpreted as scales?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals that the steps remain visible with surface textures that suggest stone. Although there is some reinterpretation to a scale-like texture in the handrail, the stone-like characteristics, such as faint veining and minor surface flaws, can still be discerned on the steps, indicating the preservation of the original material's appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the shadows fall in the same diagonal direction across the steps as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows cast across the steps are aligned diagonally in a specific direction, suggesting a consistent angle of sunlight. By comparing with Image A, shadows fall in a similar direction, indicating that the orientation and angle of light have not been altered in the editing process. This reflects an intentional retention of the original lighting conditions.",
