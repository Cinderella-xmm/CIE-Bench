      "question": "Does the edited image retain the yellow color and cubed arrangement of the mango?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango maintains a bright yellow color and is presented with a cubed arrangement. Based on common culinary presentation and visual cues in this image, it's clear that the edited photo has kept these characteristics. The reasoning is based on matching the color and distinctive grid-like cubing that is common when displaying mango in this manner.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the green color and sliced appearance of the lime?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a lime with a vibrant green color and it appears to be cut in half, revealing its distinctive circular internal structure. Limes are typically sliced this way when displayed in food photography. Therefore, the edited image does retain the green color and sliced appearance of the lime.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the orange-red color and granular texture of the chili powder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the content in the bowl next to the mango appears to be reddish with distributed specks, resembling chili flakes as opposed to the finely ground powder that might be observed with chili powder. Chili ingredients can vary in texture and color, and visually, this does not match the earlier granular texture seen in finely ground chili powder.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the relative positions of the objects on the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango, lime, and chili are placed in similar positions on the plate as seen in a standard food presentation, which usually involves positioning these items to create an appealing aesthetic. This reasoning supports the conclusion that the relative positions are retained.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the wooden texture of the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the plate with a smooth appearance and lacks the grain patterns or varying color tones typical of wood texture, suggesting a change from a wooden to a possibly non-wooden material. Therefore, the edited image does not retain the wooden texture.",
