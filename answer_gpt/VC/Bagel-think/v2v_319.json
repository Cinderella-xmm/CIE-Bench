      "question": "Is the man wearing a dark navy blue suit with a white dress shirt and a striped tie?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the man is in a chibi style which simplifies features; however, the depiction shows him wearing a suit that appears dark navy blue, accompanied by a white shirt and a tie with alternating light and dark patterns similar to stripes. This matches the typical attire style described, reflecting a business or formal context.",

      "question": "Does the ladder have visible wood grain and round dowel joints connecting each rung?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ladder is simplified as part of the chibi design style, lacking fine details such as visible wood grain or distinct dowel joints. The rungs appear as uniform wooden bars, merged into the ladder structure without intricate joinery details.",

      "question": "Is the window divided into six panes with a cream-colored frame and visible reflections of sky and trees in the glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a window with a similar pane structure to Image A, yet it condenses details, showing a clear glass with no discernible reflections of sky or trees and, indeed, no visible divisions indicating panes. The frame is cream-colored akin to Image A but in a cartoon style. Thus, it does not have six visible panes or reflections.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is depicted in a climbing pose, consistent with chibi art style, where one foot is on a lower rung while the other is positioned to step up, and his hands grip the ladder, matching the physical action outlined.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a ladder structured diagonally from the bottom left toward the upper right, aimed directly at the window, mirroring the original positioning shown in Image A. This indicates adherence to the intended directionality allowing the climb toward the window.",
