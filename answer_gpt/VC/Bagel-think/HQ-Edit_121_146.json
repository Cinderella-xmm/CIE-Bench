    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the intricate floral and vine motifs present in their original pattern and spatial arrangement across the body and lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, I observe floral and vine motifs present around the candle holder structure. They are intricately detailed, indicating careful design. However, it's essential to compare with Image A, which showcases similar motifs spread throughout the teapot’s body and lid. Despite both images sharing floral and vine motifs, their arrangement and pattern differ significantly, especially with the alteration of the object into a candle holder replaces some of the spatial placements observed in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the central chamber rendered in a rich camel red hue matching the original teapot’s body color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central chamber holds an illuminated amber candle with a transparent feature, contrasting vastly with the original teapot's rich red color depicted in Image A. While both images incorporate red hues, Image B features more of an amber glow from the candle than the deep red shade seen in the teapot.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the contour of the teapot handle clearly visible and accurately preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a teapot handle with noticeable wood grain and elegant curvature comparable to a traditional teapot handle. Upon examining Image A, the handle's form and curve are explicitly visible, matching the characteristics seen in Image B, suggesting preservation of the handle's contour from the original teapot.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the spout’s curved, elongated shape preserved without alteration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a teapot with a narrow, protruding spout whose form is authentically preserved, maintaining its curve and elongation. Image A shows a similar teapot spout in structure and shape, indicating little to no alteration was executed between the images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the base structure, including its decorative silver band, preserved in form and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the base structure showcases a wooden platform lacking the intricate silver band seen in Image A's teapot base. The presence of silver detailing forming an integral design component in Image A contrasts with the simplified wooden base in Image B, demonstrating a change in form and position.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the metallic details still rendered with embossed, raised textures rather than flat or painted designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains metallic floral decorations with detailed embossed textures similar to those seen in Image A teapot, signifying preservation of the raised design. Both images feature three-dimensional metallic adornments indicating continuity in texture representation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the body of the object still a rounded, bulbous form consistent with the original teapot’s shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon reviewing Image B, the object shape maintains a rounded form as seen in the teapot depicted in Image A. Despite Image B placing a candle within, the external shape suggests a consistency with a traditional teapot's bulbous form.",
