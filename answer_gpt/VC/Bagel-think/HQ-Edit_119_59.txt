    "Question": "Q1: Is the barbell rod visibly present and gripped by both hands across the lifter's upper back?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the barbell rod is depicted as being lifted with both hands, but it is not shown across the lifter's upper back as might be expected in a squat position. Instead, it appears as if the lifter is holding it for a deadlift. This understanding is drawn from the visual presentation, where the lifter is holding the barbell in front. The positioning of the barbell suggests a different type of lift than one across the upper back.",
