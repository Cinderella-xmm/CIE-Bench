      "question": "Is the mountain depicted as a symmetrical, perfectly conical shape with a pointed peak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain is depicted with a somewhat irregular shape, which lacks the symmetry and perfect conical form commonly associated with mountains like Mt. Fuji. This stylized form appears more artistic and less naturalistic compared to real mountain shapes. World knowledge of similar landmarks suggests that a perfectly conical shape would require symmetry on all sides and a distinct pointed peak, which this image does not possess.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the summit of the mountain have a continuous white snow cap covering the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the summit of the mountain has white areas suggesting snow, but it is not represented as a continuous or realistic snow cap. Instead, it appears as artistic white patterns that mimic snow but do not provide a continuous cover. The knowledge of natural snow caps being smooth and covering the peak uniformly supports this interpretation.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a clear, mirror-like reflection of the mountain in the lake below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does reflect the mountain in the lake below; however, the reflection is not as clear or mirror-like. It appears as an interpretive, faded replication rather than an exact mirror image. This indicates a departure from realism, where a clear reflection would look crisp and detailed, typical of a calm, reflective lake surface.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there small structures or buildings positioned along the edge of the lake, between the water and the mountain base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, small structures resembling houses or cabins are positioned along the edge of the lake. These are stylized and vary in color, standing between the waterfront and the base of the mountainous area. Despite their artistic portrayal, these elements are consistent with typical visual representations of buildings along a lake.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sky visible above the mountain, appearing as a solid or gradient blue area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no visible sky above the mountain in Image B. Instead, the background is a solid black, making the mountain and trees stand out in contrast. Typically, a sky would be represented by blue hues, but here, the overall artwork excludes any sky-like depiction above the mountain.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible layers on the mountainâ€™s slopes, showing a transition from white snow at the top to darker rock and then to green/brown vegetation below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not exhibit a natural transition of layers where snow gives way to rock and then vegetation. Instead, the mountain has an artificial and stylized appearance with white and green patches without a realistic gradation between snow, rock, and lower vegetation. This lack of transition deviates from what is typically observed in natural mountain landscapes.",
