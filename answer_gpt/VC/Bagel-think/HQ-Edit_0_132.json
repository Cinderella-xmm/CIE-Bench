    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there exactly three human figures in the scene, positioned respectively in the foreground, on a small island in the lake, and on the far left bank?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows three human figures: one prominently in the foreground holding an object, one on a small island in the lake, and another on the left side near clusters of flowers. The separation of space suggests the presence of three figures in distinctive locations.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the foreground figure depicted in a dynamic Tai Chi pose with one arm extended upward and the other hand forming a circular or open palm gesture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground figure is standing with an arm extended but holding something in that hand, suggesting a pose that is not typical of Tai Chi, which often features open hand gestures. This indicates the pose is not dynamically Tai Chi-oriented.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are multiple pink lotus flowers clearly visible among large green lily pads in the foreground of the lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B, converted to monochrome, shows flowers amidst an array of lily pads, but without clear pink color due to grayscale. The image suggests flowers are present, but without color specification.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there tall willow trees with long, vertically hanging green fronds on both the left and right sides of the lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, being a grayscale image, does not convey green visually, yet displays willow trees with characteristic long fronds hanging down vertically, one on either side of the scene.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a calm body of water in the center of the scene, reflecting the surrounding trees and sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a large calm body of water in its center, but due to the art style, typical reflections are not depicted, focusing rather on compositional elements in ink-style.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there clusters of pink flowering plants growing along the grassy slope on the left side of the lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grayscale nature of Image B makes it impossible to see pink colors; however, clusters of flowers are evident along the left slope of the lake indicating their presence without color specification.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a mountain range visible in the background, shrouded in mist and located behind the lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a mountain range silhouette in the background, appearing mist-covered, characteristic of traditional ink paintings.",
