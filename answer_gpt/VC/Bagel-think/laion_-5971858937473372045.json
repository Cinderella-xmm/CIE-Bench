      "question": "Are there exactly three women in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, there are three women standing next to each other. This can be easily discerned from the spacing and the dresses, which show continuity and symmetry, allowing for the conclusion that there are three individuals. Common configurations for wedding and formal pictures often involve groups of three, such as the bride and two bridesmaids.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the central woman positioned directly between the other two women?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the central woman standing symmetrically and equidistantly between the two women on either side. The bridged arrangement is typical in formal group photographs to ensure balance and focus on the central figure. This arrangement is visually apparent from the alignment of the women's feet and the symmetry in spacing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do all three women hold bouquets in front of their bodies with both hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each woman is seen holding a bouquet directly in front of them with both hands. This may be deduced from the similar position of their arms and hands, which are clasped around their bouquets, a standard pose in formal photography involving flowers.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all three women facing directly toward the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "All three women in Image B are oriented so their bodies and heads appear to be facing toward the viewer, suggestive of a classic portrait pose aimed toward the camera. This is a standard technique to capture subjects elegant and direct in front-facing group photographs for clear presentation.",

      "question": "Are all three women standing upright with full body visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays all three women standing upright with visible full bodies. As discerned from the image, the cuts of their dresses and postures suggest a fully upright stand, aiding in defining a proper silhouette typical in photography involving formal attire.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the facial features are blurred in Image B, there is no indication of an open-mouthed smile. Given the position of the arms holding bouquets and traditional photo compositions, it's unlikely that the woman is expressing such an exaggerated gesture as a wide, open-mouthed smile.",
