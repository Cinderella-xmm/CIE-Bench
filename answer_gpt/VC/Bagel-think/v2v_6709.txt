    "Question": "Q1: Is the faceted star-shaped pattern covering the body of the perfume bottle preserved in the Lego version?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle's body is constructed using Lego bricks, which are uniform and have a grid-like texture. The original faceted star-shaped pattern seen in Image A is characterized by intricate and detailed glasswork. Given the nature of Lego bricks, it is not possible to replicate this pattern with the same intricacy and subtlety; hence the pattern is simplified or lost. Thus, the faceted star-shaped pattern is not preserved in the Lego version.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the perfume bottle maintain its cylindrical shape with tapered sides and flat base in the Lego construction?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle constructed with Lego bricks appears more rectangular and blocky due to the nature of Lego pieces. In contrast, Image A shows a bottle with a cylindrical shape and tapered sides. The use of Lego makes it difficult to replicate curved surfaces precisely, meaning the original shape cannot be maintained exactly. The bottle in Image B lacks the smooth curves of the cylindrical bottle in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the gold faceted spherical cap positioned at the top of the bottle preserved in the Lego version?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the Lego bottle features a stack of yellow bricks, forming a rough spherical cap. However, the original gold faceted spherical cap from Image A is sophisticated and precisely faceted, which the Lego cap cannot replicate due to the nature of Lego pieces. The visual approximation suggests an attempt to mimic the general shape, but it cannot be preserved identically.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the spray nozzle located on the side of the bottleâ€™s neck, with a visible mist plume extending diagonally outward, preserved in the Lego version?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the Lego construction features a block positioned on the side towards the neck of the bottle, attempting to mimic the spray nozzle. The mist plume, made of small white Lego pieces, extends diagonally outward, similar to the mist in Image A. While the method differs, the concept of a spray nozzle and mist is visually replicated in the Lego version.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the undulating folds of the fabric background beneath the bottle preserved in form and position in the Lego version?",
    "explanation": "Image B retains the fabric backdrop with undulating folds beneath the Lego bottle. While the Lego construction of the bottle affects how the fabric interacts with the object's base, the folds themselves remain visually consistent with those seen in Image A. The relative positioning and form of the fabric are preserved.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the perfume bottle positioned directly on top of the fabric background, maintaining contact and alignment with the folds, in the Lego version?",
    "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the bottle is positioned on the fabric surface. The alignment and contact with the fabric appear to be consistent in both images, suggesting that despite the change in bottle material and construction method, the position relative to the fabric is maintained.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the size of the gold cap proportionally consistent with the body of the bottle in the Lego version?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the proportion between the yellow Lego cap and the body of the bottle is notably different from the original proportions seen in Image A. The Lego construction cap is much larger relative to the body compared to the original design, indicating a difference in proportional sizing caused by the constraints of using uniform Lego bricks.",
    "answer": "No"
