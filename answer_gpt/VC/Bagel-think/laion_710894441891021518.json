      "question": "Is the white tea light candle present on the black surface to the left of the bonsai pot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no tea light candle visible at all. The image features a statue-like figure resembling a dark, fantastical creature with glowing eyes and wings standing on a textured stone. This indicates a significant change compared to what is described. Without any sign of a bonsai pot or tea light candle as seen in Image A, in Image B, the environment is entirely altered from a simple plant setup to an elaborate, decorative figure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the bonsai and candle resting on a flat black surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks any bonsai or candle and it does not clearly show the black surface as described. Instead, it shows a figure standing on a textured stone base, which covers most of the image's foreground. The previous simple setting has been replaced by this artistic centerpiece, making it clear that the original black surface is not the focal point anymore.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background uniformly light gray with no visible patterns or objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is indeed uniformly light gray with no visible patterns or additional objects besides the main figure. This aspect has remained consistent with the light gray background in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bonsai planted in a wide, shallow, teal-colored ceramic pot that occupies the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B completely lacks the bonsai and pot. Instead, it features a decorative, dark creature figure prominently displayed in the center, standing on a stone platform. The bonsai and teal pot have been replaced with this artistic figure, thereby occupying the center stage differently than Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are dark soil and exposed root matter visible at the surface of the pot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has transformed from showcasing a bonsai's soil and roots to a completely different arrangement. There is no soil or pot visible because the image has shifted to displaying an elaborate decorative figure on a stone base. Thus, the presence of soil or roots has been entirely removed in this context.",

      "question": "Is the bonsai positioned centrally and upright in the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there isn't a bonsai present at all. Instead, the central focus is the artistically crafted fantasy creature standing upright on a stone platform. This indicates a complete change from Image A, where the bonsai was the central subject placed upright in the frame.",
