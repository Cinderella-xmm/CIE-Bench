    "Question": "Q1: Are the two jet engines mounted under the wings of the airplane present and correctly positioned?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the airplane depicted resembles a toy airplane which features small, simplified representations of jet engines positioned under the wings. These engines are consistent with the typical location seen on a real airplane's wing, even though they are stylized for the toy. The engine placement is coherent with the original function, serving as a basic representation of how aircraft engines are mounted. Therefore, based on this toy model's design intent, the engines are present and correctly positioned.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the continuous row of oval-shaped passenger windows visible along the side of the fuselage?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a simplified model of an airplane shows a continuous row of oval-shaped marks along the side of the fuselage, mimicking the passenger windows found in real airplanes. These features suggest the presence of passenger windows in the model representation. Hence, there is a clear representation of such window formation albeit in a toy format.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the rounded nose cone with the three-part cockpit window configuration present at the front of the airplane?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the toy airplane has a rounded nose cone at the front with a simplified window configuration. Though the level of detail does not match that of a real airplane, the toy does feature marks that indicate a cockpit window area, albeit stylized and compressed to fit the toy's scale. This is consistent with the typical layout seen in full-sized aircraft.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the tall vertical stabilizer (tail fin) present at the rear of the airplane?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, which features a toy airplane model, a vertical stabilizer is present at the rear end of the airplane. This component, while crafted to fit the toy scale, still resembles the tall fin found on real airplanes, indicating its presence in the toy representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the landing gear assemblies with multiple wheels visible beneath the fuselage and wings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the toy airplane does not display any landing gear assemblies with multiple wheels beneath the fuselage and wings, which are typical features on a real airplane for support while on the ground. This simplification or omission is common in toy models.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the main wing structure extending from the fuselage with engines mounted underneath?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the toy airplane shows main wing structures extending from the fuselage. Additionally, the engines are represented and appear to be situated underneath these wing structures, similar to how real airplanes' engines are mounted, albeit in a simplified form typical for toys. This setup demonstrates the essential layout found in actual aircrafts.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the three cockpit windows arranged in a horizontal line at the front of the airplane?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the toy airplane features window-like markings at the front, suggesting a cockpit window configuration. While these markings simplify the details due to the toy's scale, they imply a horizontal arrangement characteristic of a cockpit window setup found in real airplanes. Therefore, there is a resemblance to the typical three-part window layout.",
    "answer": "Yes"
