    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the subject's facial expression, including a wide smile showing teeth and eyes looking upward to the left, preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face is blurred, making it impossible to discern any specific facial features or expressions. Therefore, there is no way to determine if such a facial expression is preserved.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the subject's head turned slightly to the left, maintaining the original angle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the subject's head appears to be in almost the same position, oriented slightly to the left. The shoulders and upper body's positioning seem consistent between the two images, indicating that the head's angle has been maintained.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the subject's hands clasped gently in front of the torso, with fingers interlaced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hands are clasped in front of the torso, similar to the posture in Image A. The fingers are not interlaced but are overlapping in a gentle clasp, maintaining the overall hand posture.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the henna designs visible on the subject's palms and fingers preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible henna designs on the palms and fingers. Any intricate designs observable would have been visible in detail if present. Comparative analysis with Image A (which features henna designs) indicates that this aspect has not been preserved.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the subject's natural skin tone and lighting on the face and arms preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a significant change in lighting and possibly skin tone due to the artistic effects applied, with a glowing and saturated look. The arms in Image B display more pronounced highlights and a potentially altered tone compared to Image A, which suggests the natural skin tone and lighting have not been preserved.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the subject's long, wavy brown hair flowing over the shoulders preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hair is long and flowing over the shoulders, with a wavy texture, which is consistent with Image A. The hair maintains its prominent feature across both images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
