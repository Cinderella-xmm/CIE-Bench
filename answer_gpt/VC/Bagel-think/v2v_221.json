      "question": "Is the large black patch on the left shoulder of the cow present and clearly defined?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cow is depicted in a cartoon or chibi style, which alters some real-world features. The cow has black patches, but these are stylized, simpler, and more uniformly distributed compared to realistic cow markings. The patches are bold and rounded, which is consistent with a simplified cartoon depiction. Image A shows a real cow with a large black patch on its left shoulder, indicating that this detail is not consistently maintained in the cartoon version.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a continuous white stripe running down the center of the cow’s face from the forehead to the snout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cow has a stylized and simplified depiction of facial features with a symmetrical design typical in cartoon illustrations. There appears to be a central white portion of the face, but the simplicity and the design do not clearly show a continuous distinct white stripe as would be seen in reality. In Image A, there is indeed a white stripe that runs continuously from the forehead to the snout of the real cow.",

      "question": "Are the cow’s horns curved upward and outward, with a light base and dark tips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cow has small upward-pointing horns that are common in caricature-like representations. They are light in color but simplified and do not feature a gradient of color from base to tip as seen in real cows. In Image A, the real cow's horns are curved outward with dark tips, which are not replicated in the cartoon version.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vintage-style television depicted below the cow does have a speaker grille on the right side and also multiple control knobs at the bottom, which can be seen in the cartoon style. This matches the real-world design features seen in Image A, where the real television shares similar attributes.",

      "question": "Are both front hooves of the cow positioned on top of the television screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon cow has both of its front hooves placed on top of the television, giving an appearance of playful interaction. This artistic choice is in keeping with the chibi style. Image A has the real cow standing behind the television with no contact between the hooves and the television.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B depicts a simple and stylized version of a natural environment, with a green base representing grass and a blue sky with white clouds, which is typical in cartoon renderings. Image A has an actual grassy field and a blue sky with clouds, which the cartoon version simplifies without losing key elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cow is depicted with a stylized expression, and while there is a distinct outline for the nose area, the color is not pinkish-brown, but more of a uniform lighter tone typical of cartoon simplification. There are also no distinct nostrils drawn, as the design prioritizes simplified and playful appearance. In contrast, Image A presents a realistic depiction with the real cow having a pinkish-brown nose with visible nostrils.",
