      "question": "Are the two upright, pointed ears with black outer edges and pinkish-red inner patterns present on the mask?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mask indeed features upright, pointed ears with black outer edges and visually distinct pinkish-red inner patterns. These elements are consistently present in the edited design of the mask, emphasizing the stylized appearance. Such ears are often interpreted as part of the traditional Kitsune themes, reflecting cultural aesthetics. Therefore, based on the clear depiction of these features, the answer is affirmative.",

      "question": "Are the human eyes clearly visible through the eye openings in the mask?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design is illustrative and abstract, featuring stylized eyes that are part of the mask's design, rather than actual human eyes visible through openings. This depiction aligns with typical artistic renderings where elements of the mask itself represent key features such as eyes, often seen in stylized artworks or traditional representations. Hence, the answer is negative.",

      "question": "Is the kimono structured with a V-shaped neckline and wide sleeves extending from the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) presents an abstract and stylized version of a kimono-like garment. Despite the artistic abstraction, the design maintains indicative elements such as wide sleeves extended outward, structured visually as part of the depiction. The neckline appears to flow around the shoulders in the abstract art, reflecting typical kimono characteristics in an artistic form. Thus, the answer is affirmative regarding the fundamental kimono elements being present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a wide sash (obi) positioned horizontally across the chest, aligned with the center of the kimono?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the abstract design does not clearly depict a wide sash (obi) across the chest, as typical imagery might. Instead, it appears stylized and less defined, focusing on artistic renditions rather than any specific structural garment details. This kind of abstract treatment is common in art focusing on thematic expression instead of detailed clothing features. Consequently, based on the visual cues, the answer is negative.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there three distinct whiskers on each side of the mask, alternating in black and white?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly features stylized whiskers as part of the mask design, each side containing alternating black and white whiskers that are consistent with traditional imagery and artistic motifs often used in representations of masks. This pattern adds to the symmetry and thematic interpretation reminiscent of kitsune or fox imagery in traditional settings. Therefore, the visually consistent alternating whisker design supports an affirmative answer.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the nose positioned centrally below the eyes and shaped as a small black oval, with a faint mouth line beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nose is drawn as a central black element beneath the stylized eyes, fitting the description of an oval shape. There is indeed a faint line indicating a mouth beneath it, typical of abstract representations that convey facial features efficiently. Such positioning is commonly used in mask or artistic depictions for clear, centralized facial feature conveyance, thus supporting an affirmative answer.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the overall composition symmetrically balanced along the vertical axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is designed with a clear symmetry, reflecting themes of balance and harmony that are central to formal artistic representations. The vertical axis symmetry is indicated visually by mirrored elements to both sides of the axis, incorporating design components such as ears and decorative motifs. This reflects not only a traditional approach but also enhances visual aesthetic balance, lending support to an affirmative answer.",
