    "Question": "Q1: Is the skater depicted in a mid-air crouched posture with both arms extended outward for balance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the skater is positioned in a crouched posture, typical for airborne maneuvers to stabilize and control the skateboard's movement. Both arms are extended outward, which aids in balance during such tricks. This posture is consistent with common skating techniques.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the skater’s left foot placed firmly on the skateboard while the right foot is slightly raised off the board?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the skater's left foot appears to be planted solidly on the skateboard, offering stability while performing a trick. The right foot seems slightly lifted, which is often necessary for adjusting balance and direction during mid-air maneuvers.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the skater’s head and eyes look toward the right side of the frame, indicating forward momentum?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the skater's body orientation and the natural angle suggest his focus is towards the direction of his momentum. This involves looking forward in the direction of travel during a trick or jump, though the exact angle of head and eye direction can't be verified visually due to the blurred face.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the skater positioned above the surface of the ramp, indicating he is airborne?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the skater is evidently above the ramp's surface, denoting that he is airborne. This is clearly visible since no part of him or the skateboard is touching the ramp, illustrating a leap or trick in motion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Is there a curved ramp structure forming a bowl-like shape in the foreground, beneath the skater?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground features a curved structure resembling a bowl common in skate parks. This provides skaters with a surface for performing aerial maneuvers and is distinctly visible beneath the skater.",
    "answer": "Yes"
