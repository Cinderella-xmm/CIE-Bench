    "Question": "Q2: Are the hands positioned together on the lap?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hands are placed in front of them, holding a quill pen over an open book, rather than resting together on the lap. This posture implies an active engagement in writing or similar activity rather than a passive resting position.",

    "explanation": "The head in Image B is situated directly above the torso, maintaining a centered alignment with the symmetrical positioning of the body.

    "Question": "Q4: Is there a visible armrest beneath the subjectâ€™s right hand?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's right arm is engaged in writing on the tabletop, indicating that it is not resting on an armrest. The visual cues do not suggest any armrest support beneath the right hand, as it is primarily supporting the action of writing.",

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the arms bent at the elbows and resting along the sides of the body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the arms are active, especially the right arm which is involved in writing with a quill. Therefore, while the arms are bent at the elbows, they are not resting along the sides of the body but are oriented towards the writing task, indicating a more dynamic posture.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the legs positioned symmetrically beneath the torso?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not prominently display the legs due to the angle and the subject's attire. However, given the alignment of the upper body and the typical symmetrical posture in such formal representations, it is reasonable to deduce that the legs are likely positioned symmetrically beneath the torso, consistent with seated official or formal portrait depictions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
