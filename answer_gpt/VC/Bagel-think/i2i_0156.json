    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the printed texts on both open pages still clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the printed text on the open pages is visible, and the book is well-lit, making the text easy to read. The focus is sharp enough for the text to be distinguishable, indicating that the print is clear.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the book cover still visibly pinkish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, observing the visible portion of the book cover next to the pages, it maintains a pinkish hue. This conclusion is drawn based on the lighting and color rendering, which shows continuity in the hue from cover to edge.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the wooden background with its natural texture and grain patterns intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to be made of wood, evident from the visible grain patterns and knots typical of such surfaces. The texture is clearly defined, suggesting the natural grain patterns are preserved.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the book still open with the pages aligned logically on the wooden surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book is open and positioned on the wooden surface in a way that the pages are aligned smoothly with the edges resting naturally on the surface. This positioning follows the logical manner a book typically lies when opened and placed down.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the pages retain their beige color and slightly aged texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pages of the book exhibit a beige color, indicative of older or aged paper. The pages also show a texture that is not pristine, supporting the notion of age-related quality such as a softened and slightly worn appearance.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
