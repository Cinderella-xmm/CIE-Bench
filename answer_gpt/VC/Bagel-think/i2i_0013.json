      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the hairstyle is depicted using an illustrative style with yellow lines resembling curly hair. While it does not replicate Einstein's actual white hair, the visual representation suggests a playful homage to his disheveled hair style but not the color. Yellow is typically not associated with Einstein's white hair, indicating the color has been changed but the visual cue of disheveled hair somewhat remains through illustration.",

      "question": "Does the edited image show Einstein with his tongue out?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a blurred face, making it impossible to discern specific facial expressions such as having his tongue out. There are no visible indications or recognizable traits in the illustrative section identified to suggest Einstein's renowned playful expression of having his tongue out.",

      "question": "Does the edited image maintain Einstein’s face shape and proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image uses a stylized cartoon format which can inherently alter proportions and face shape for artistic effect. The blurred area prevents clear visibility of face shape and proportions, so even if intended, it cannot be accurately analyzed due to the obscured visual. Given that the style is different from realistic proportions, we can assume that it does not strictly maintain Einstein's actual face shape and proportions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the details, the edited image appears to illustrate character attire with a suit and tie in a stylized form. This suggests that a suit and tie are depicted through color blocking and simplified cartoon illustration, pointing to the presence of formal attire which is consistent with Einstein's well-known style.",

      "question": "Does the edited image convey Einstein's playful demeanor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, being a stylized illustration or emblem, does not provide facial expression details due to the blurred area preventing assessment of demeanor. While artistic context may deliver a playful version of his image through caricature style, the critical aspect of Einstein's recognized playful demeanor cannot be confirmed in the edited version through observable traits.",
