      "question": "Is the owl's face clearly depicted with two large, dark, round eyes and a distinct facial disc?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl's face is prominently featured with two large, dark, round eyes. This is a typical characteristic of owl illustrations, where the eyes are exaggerated to emphasize their nocturnal vision capabilities. The facial disc, which is the circular arrangement of feathers around the owl's face, is clearly defined, serving to enhance these features visually.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl exhibits horizontal bars across its chest, which are stylized in the illustration, similar to those seen in real owls for camouflage. Additionally, the white spots on the owl's wings are visible and help to add detail and realism to the depiction of feathers.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the owl facing mostly forward, but with its head slightly turned, a common pose in wildlife illustrations to make the owl's gaze appear more engaging and lifelike.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree branch features a stylized texture. While the illustration style is smooth and graphical, the intention appears to be to showcase bark with a distinct pattern that is simpler compared to the original realistic depiction.",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the moon is illustrated behind the owl but is portrayed artistically. Its positioning is mostly in the center of the upper portion of the frame, aligning with eyes' natural focus towards celestial arrangements in illustrations, even though it's not perfectly centered compared to the original image.",
