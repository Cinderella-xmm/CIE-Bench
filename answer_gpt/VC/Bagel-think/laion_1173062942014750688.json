      "question": "Are the blue circular spots present on the serpent’s body, positioned as eyes or eye-like features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent's body is composed of bead-like segments, each having blue circular spots on them. These spots are positioned at various points on the beads and resemble eye-like features. The visual design of the spots, combined with their placement and appearance, suggest that they are indeed intended to resemble eyes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the red and yellow colors form the primary scale patterns along the serpent’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the serpent with predominantly red and yellow colors, which are part of the beads' patterns. These colors are prominent and create a repetitive pattern along the serpent's body, forming what can be interpreted as scale patterns.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the black zigzag or spotted patterns visible as tribal markings on the serpent’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The serpent's body in Image B shows black markings that are either zigzag or spotted in nature. These markings are visibly distinct on the bead-like segments and add to the decorative appearance, resembling what could be considered tribal markings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the segments of the serpent’s body shaped like spheres or near-spheres, reflecting the original bead form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The serpent in Image B consists of segments that are visually similar to spherical shapes, mimicking the original beads' appearance. This spherical or near-spherical form reflects the bead-like construction of the serpent's body.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the surface of the serpent retain a matte, slightly uneven texture resembling hand-painted craftsmanship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the serpent in Image B appears to have a matte finish, with a texture indicative of hand-painted or hand-crafted work. This is suggested by the slightly uneven surface area visible across the beads, which typically results from handcrafted artistry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent’s body displays a variety of colors, including red, yellow, blue, black, and white. These colors are consistently visible across the beads, maintaining the color palette seen in the original bead design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the patterns on the serpent’s body irregular and varied from segment to segment, matching the original bead diversity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The patterns on the serpent’s body in Image B are irregular and vary from one segment to another. Each bead-like segment displays unique patterns, resembling the diversity found in handcrafted beads. This variation supports the notion that the serpent maintains the original bead diversity.",
