    "Question": "Q1: Are the two tall towers positioned symmetrically on either side of the central section?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, we observe a wooden structure resembling a castle with two taller towers positioned on either side of a central section. Symmetry is visually evident as both towers mirror each other's position around the central entrance section. This positioning is typical in architecture intended to evoke a sense of balance and fortified design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a centrally located arched doorway with a wooden door beneath a rounded arch?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a centrally located arched doorway as a prominent feature of the castle-like structure. However, there is no wooden door present; the space appears to be open. The stylistic design of toy-like interlocking pieces emphasizes shapes without functional details like actual doors.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does a set of stone steps ascend from the water level directly to the arched entrance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a set of steps is indeed present leading up to the arched entrance, but there is no indication of water or that these steps ascend from a water level. They seem to directly connect from a flat surface, such as a tabletop, up to the entrance, reflecting the toy-like nature of the object.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there multiple rectangular windows with dark frames aligned vertically on each tower?",
    "explanation": "Image B reveals windows on each tower, formed by the interlocking wooden blocks, but they are not rectangular with dark frames. Instead, these are shaped more intricately, integrated into the design pattern of the toy structure. The typical toy design doesn't provide the specifics like dark frames or strictly rectangular window shapes.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the tops of both towers feature flat surfaces with crenellated edges?",
    "explanation": "The tops of the towers in Image B are flat and exhibit crenellated edges, similar to traditional castle designs. This crenellation forms part of the toy's aesthetic, emulating historical architectural elements through the use of interlocking wooden blocks.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a low stone wall extending horizontally from the right side of the castle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the right side of the structure does include extensions, but they consist of wooden blocks rather than a stone wall. The toy-like construction doesn't provide a representation mimicking stone walls, sticking instead to the wooden block motif.",
    "answer": "No"
