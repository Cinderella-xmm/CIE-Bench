    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the original facial features including the eye shape, nose contour, lip fullness, and symmetrical jawline?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the region of the face is intentionally blurred, making it impossible to discern any specific facial features such as eye shape, nose contour, or lip fullness. Therefore, we cannot confirm if these features retain their original characteristics.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the white hair still present, flowing down past the shoulders, and positioned naturally around the head and neck?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hair is depicted as part of a stained glass mosaic, and while the hair color and general flow can be implied, it is stylized rather than naturalistic. The hair appears more as a solid block of color rather than individual flowing strands.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the crown still present with its original angular, symmetrical design and central gemstone at the apex?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mosaic depiction replaces the detailed design of the crown with a more abstract representation. The angular, symmetrical features are not distinctly visible, and there is no discernible central gemstone.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the wings still symmetrically extended from the shoulders with the same broad, upward-curving shape and full span?",
    "explanation": "The edited image shows wings that are indeed extended symmetrically from the shoulders, maintaining a broad, upward-curving shape consistent with the original design, albeit in a more stylized mosaic form.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the figure still standing upright with arms at the sides and facing directly forward?",

    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the original skin tone preserved, and does the facial expression remain neutral with a slight hint of serenity?",
    "explanation": "The skin tone and expression in Image B are altered due to the mosaic effect, which does not represent any specific or realistic skin tone, and no expression can be determined due to the stylization.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the body proportions, including the torso width, arm length, and breast shape, consistent with the original image?",

    "answer": "Yes"
