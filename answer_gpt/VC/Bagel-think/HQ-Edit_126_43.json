      "question": "Is there at least one clock face with Roman numerals visible on the front or side of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, analyzing the upper section of the clock, we observe two openings where clock faces would typically be. However, instead of clock faces with Roman numerals, there are mechanical elements resembling eyes or dials. Combining this observation with world knowledge of clocks usually having Roman numerals visible, we conclude that Image B does not feature any clock face with Roman numerals.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower section of the structure clearly displays internal mechanical components like pendulums, visible through what appears to be glass panels. This is consistent with the typical design of old clocks having transparent panels for showcasing their mechanics.",
