      "question": "Is the chair supported by a five-star base with exactly five legs, each ending in a caster?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is clearly a five-star base as seen from the five distinct legs extending from the central circular portion at the bottom of the chair. Each of these legs is fitted with a caster wheel, which is a common design for office chairs to enable smooth movement. A five-star base is typical for this style of chair, providing stability and balance. Thus, the visual elements unmistakably indicate the presence of five legs each ending in a caster.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a separate headrest cushion positioned directly above the main backrest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chair has an apparent division between the main backrest and an additional, distinct cushion positioned right above it. This cushion is similar in appearance but elevated, indicating its purpose as a headrest. Such a design is common in executive or ergonomic chairs where neck and head support is important. This configuration confirms the presence of a separate headrest cushion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there two armrests, one on each side, extending horizontally from the chairâ€™s midsection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the chair's design clearly includes two armrests, with one positioned on each side of the chair. These armrests seem to be affixed to the midsection of the chair and extend horizontally outward, providing support to the user's arms when seated. This layout is standard and often used to enhance comfort and posture, validating the presence of armrests.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the backrest vertically aligned behind the seat, rising from the same central axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backrest of the chair is aligned vertically, beginning right from where the seat starts and extending upwards in a straight manner. The visual clues indicate that the backrest is part of the same structural axis that the seat is connected to, showing a conventional design pattern prevalent in office chairs for ergonomic support.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the chair maintain a tall, high-back silhouette with the headrest significantly higher than the seat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a chair with a high-back design. The backrest significantly elevates well above the seating surface, culminating in a separate headrest positioned at the topmost part of the chair's back. Such a silhouette is commonly seen in chairs intended for extended sitting periods, where a tall backrest aids in full spinal support, confirming the presence of a high-back silhouette.",
