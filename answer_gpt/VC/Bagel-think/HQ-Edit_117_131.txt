    "Question": "Q1: Is the squirrel standing upright on its hind legs with its front paws clasped together near the chest?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel has a vibrant and stylized appearance more fitting of an animated or illustrative style. The squirrel is depicted standing on its hind legs with the front paws drawn together near the chest. This pose is typical for squirrels, especially when they're depicted in a standing or alert position. The artistic rendering in Image B maintains this pose for familiarity and recognition purposes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the squirrel have a large, bushy tail that curves upward and outward, extending above the back?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, even though the squirrel has a fantastical purple coloration, the stylization includes a large, bushy tail curling upward and outward above the back. This depiction is consistent with how squirrel tails are often portrayed, accentuating their shape and fluffiness.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Are the ears of the squirrel rounded and positioned on top of the head, with a visible pink inner surface?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a squirrel with highly exaggerated and stylized features, including ears that are positioned on top of the head. Although the unique coloration and context are fanciful, the ears appear rounded, but there's no visible pink inner surface; rather, they match the outer purple color scheme.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the eyes large, round, dark, and located symmetrically on either side of the face, with visible pupils?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel's eyes are stylized with large, round glasses rather than traditional eyes. The depiction maintains the concept of large eyes through the glasses, giving a playful and whimsical look but does not display a natural dark eye with visible pupils. Instead, the lenses dominate the facial features.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the head proportionally smaller than the body, with the tail approximately equal in length to the body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel's head appears larger in proportion to the body due to the exaggerated artistic style often used in animations or cartoons. Its tail, while bushy and prominent, doesn't equal the body's length in this depiction, aligning more with a playful, unrealistic portrayal.",
    "answer": "No"
