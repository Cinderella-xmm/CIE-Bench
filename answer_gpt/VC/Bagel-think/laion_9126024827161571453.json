      "question": "Are the battery tops rendered in copper color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tops of the batteries are rendered in a color that resembles a shade between copper and orange. The depiction suggests a copper-like appearance, which aligns with the common branding of Duracell batteries known for their copper tops.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the word \"DURACELL\" printed vertically in white on the black body of each battery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'DURACELL' is indeed printed in white text in a vertical orientation on the black body of each battery. This design choice is consistent with typical branding practices for Duracell batteries.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible silver band near the base of the batteries that carries the inscription 'DURALOCK.' The design of the area lacks this specific detailing seen in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) contains text that appears distorted and reads as '10 17EO RFANES!' instead of '10 Years in Storage.' This alteration indicates that the original message is not clearly present in an understandable form.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows exactly four objects that resemble batteries, maintaining consistency with the original Image A, which also depicts four batteries. This indicates typical packaging for a set of batteries.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the brand name \"DURACELL\" displayed in large, bold letters at the top of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brand name at the top of Image B has been altered to read 'DURACELL YERRS' instead of the standard 'DURACELL.' Although the word 'DURACELL' is prominently displayed, the additional word 'YERRS' makes it different from the standard branding seen in Image A.",
