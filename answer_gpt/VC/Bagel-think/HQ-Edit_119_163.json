    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the embossed dragons with detailed scales, claws, and flowing bodies clearly visible on the body of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cylindrical object features a section with embossed dragon motifs. These motifs are discernible on the surface of the object but lack intricate clarity. Based on world knowledge, embossed dragons typically have detailed scales and claws resulting in a highly defined appearance, which is not as evident in the edited image. While the dragon motifs are present, the details of scales, claws, and flowing bodies may not be as clearly visible as expected in a high-resolution embossed design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the surface of the object textured with raised relief patterns, particularly around the dragon motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible tonal variations on the object's surface implying some texturing, especially around the dragon motifs. Typically, embossed motifs feature raised relief patterns, which create a textured surface. These patterns are observable but not as pronounced due to the subtlety of detailing and lighting in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a distinct spout extending from the side of the object, shaped like a dragon's head with an open mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is cylindrical with no extension or spout visible on its sides. A dragon's head-shaped spout would be a protruding feature that is distinctively identified in teapots or similar objects. The image shows no such feature, indicating the absence of a spout shaped like a dragon's head.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the object retain a silver-colored, highly reflective metallic surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object has a metallic appearance with a reflective quality, consistent with a silver-colored surface. However, it is more matte compared to a highly polished, reflective surface possibly due to lighting or image resolution, but it retains a general metallic look. Considering the visual context and general metallic surface characteristics, it is reasonable to conclude the object's surface appearance as silver-colored.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the object positioned upright on a flat surface, such as a wooden table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cylindrical object resting on a wooden surface; the object is standing upright as evidenced by its vertical orientation and stable positioning. The wooden surface appears flat, thus supporting the objectâ€™s upright position logically. Such a positioning is typical for displaying cylindrical containers.",
