    "Question": "Q1: Does the image retain the man’s smiling expression and distinct facial features?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is represented as a figurine instead of a real person, which inherently lacks distinct human expressions and detailed facial features. Given the nature of the figurine, it cannot have a realistic smiling expression or distinct facial features such as those found in Image A. Therefore, the level of detail for the face conveyed through the figurine does not match the real human features of the original image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the man’s short, neatly styled hairstyle accurately retained in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine has a hairstyle that mimics the short and neatly styled appearance typically seen in formal settings, which is consistent with a typical representation of the hairstyle from Image A. The figurine captures the general shape and neatness of the style even if it's an abstract model.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the edited image include the black T-shirt with its central white graphic design?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is wearing a formal suit which is different from the casual attire seen in Image A. The white graphic design on the black T-shirt present in Image A is replaced by a tie in Image B, indicating a change in attire style.",

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the subject positioned on or near a bookshelf in the edited image?",

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the blue and red colors of the books visible in the background of the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, books with red and blue colors are observable on the shelves in the background. This consistent placement and coloring suggest that the bookshelf containing these colored books has been retained in the edited image.",
