    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the three distinct mountain peaks—two broad and one sharp—present and positioned in the same relative layout as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background layout of the mountains remains consistent with the original image, Image A. The broad peaks and the sharp peak maintain their relative positions, which is confirmed by the visual pattern in both images. The mountains' positioning is preserved despite other edits introduced in Image B.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the lake located in the same basin with the same irregular shape, including the curved western edge and shallow extension toward the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the lake present in the basin identical to that in Image A. The visual cues, such as the lake's curved western edge and the shallow extension toward the foreground, match those in Image A, indicating no changes in the shape and location of the lake.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the trails maintain their original routing pattern across the slopes, including their connection to the lake and convergence points?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the color alterations in Image B, the routing pattern of the trails across the slopes remains unchanged from Image A. The connection to the lake and their convergence points are still visually identifiable, matching those in the original image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible human figures present near the shoreline of the lake, consistent with their placement in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks visible human figures on the shoreline that were present in Image A. The visual data in Image B does not show any human presence near the lake, suggesting alteration or removal of these elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the rocky outcrops and boulders visible along the shoreline and slopes, maintaining their original distribution and size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rocky outcrops and boulders are not visually prominent, suggesting a significant alteration from Image A. The elements are either altered in texture or otherwise camouflaged due to the edits, altering their original appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the green vegetation cover present across the slopes, maintaining its general distribution and density as seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a dramatic color change and the introduction of purple hues over the vegetation, replacing the original green seen in Image A. Although the coverage pattern might be similar, the color modifications indicate that the vegetation's appearance is not preserved.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the sky clear blue with scattered wispy clouds, matching the original atmospheric conditions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Like Image A, Image B retains a clear blue sky with scattered wispy clouds. There are no alterations to the sky's atmospheric conditions, making it consistent with the original image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
