    "Question": "Q1: Is the dog's pose still focused on the tennis ball, with the ball near its nose?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the main subject is now a blurred region, and this does not reveal the dog's pose or the tennis ball's proximity to its nose. Based on this visual cue, it is not possible to determine if the dog is focused on the ball or if the ball is near its nose.",

    "Question": "Q2: Does the tennis ball retain its green color with a pink stripe?",

    "Question": "Q3: Is the dog still depicted as observing or interacting with the tennis ball?",
    "explanation": "Image B uses an overlay that obscures the dog's depiction completely. Without visual evidence of the dog's gaze or actions, there is no basis to conclude that the dog is interacting with the tennis ball.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the dog's posture still reflect a prone, ball-focused position?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the overlay does not allow observation of the dog's posture, making it impossible to determine the dog's position or whether it is focused on the ball.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the texture of the tennis ball (felt-like surface) still present?",
