      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the zebras' bodies covered in distinct black and white stripes that follow the natural pattern seen in the original image, including variations in thickness and alignment across the torso, legs, and face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras are depicted as cartoonish characters, which means the stripes are simplified and stylized compared to their real counterparts in Image A. In cartoons, details like stripe variation and alignment are often generalized for clarity and aesthetic appeal. The stripes in Image B are uniform and lack the complexity seen in natural zebra patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is each zebra depicted with its head lowered toward the ground in a natural grazing pose, with legs positioned to support this stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras are shown in a grazing position with their heads lowered, mimicking a grazing pose. This is consistent with the original image where zebras are naturally grazing. However, the cartoon style means details like leg positioning are simplified. Cartoon zebra leg positioning generally conveys a grazing pose.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the horizontal wire fence with evenly spaced wooden posts clearly visible across the mid-ground of the image, separating the field from the treeline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fence is depicted as wooden, lacking the wire aspect shown in Image A. It runs across the mid-ground, maintaining the separation between the field and trees as seen in the original. The representation of fenced separation is achieved through simplification for cartoon aesthetics.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the ground covered in green grass with visible patches of bare soil and small green shrubs scattered throughout the field?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the ground with cartoon-like green grass, but lacks visible patches of bare soil or varied vegetation such as shrubs. Image A shows more realistic landscape variation and different textures like soil patches, which are absent in the cartoon simplification.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a continuous line of green trees and bushes behind the fence, with a clear light blue sky above the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a backdrop of green trees, maintaining the continuous line but differs in style. The trees are more stylized and cartoonish than realistic. Though a light blue sky is evident, it reflects a simplified cartoon atmosphere compared to the more complex environmental depiction in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the zebras have short, upright manes composed of alternating black and white stripes, consistent with their body patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras possess short, upright cartoon manes, which align with the stylized body stripes but differ significantly from the natural complexity present in Image A. The mane patterning in the cartoon is made to be simple, emphasizing aesthetic consistency and recognizable features.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the zebra’s hooves dark in color and positioned on the ground in a way that supports their grazing posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the zebra hooves in a dark color characteristic of a simplified cartoon design. They seem to be placed in positions that support a grazing pose, as the zebras are shown as managing to lower their heads toward the ground, similar to Image A’s natural positioning. This shows the simplification prevalent in cartoon depictions.",
