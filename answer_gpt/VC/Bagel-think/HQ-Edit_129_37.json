    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the cardinal direction labels N, E, S, and W clearly visible and correctly positioned on the embossed compass face of the perfume bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which features a perfume bottle, the bottle design resembles a compass face but does not display typical cardinal direction labels such as N, E, S, and W. A compass typically has these labels in fixed locations to denote directions, but in this image, these are absent as it's more stylized for the bottle design rather than functional as a compass.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the full 360-degree scale with numerical markings (e.g., 0, 90, 180, 270) present and evenly spaced around the outer edge of the embossed compass face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the perfume bottle's design which imitates a compass does not have a 360-degree numerical scale with markings such as 0, 90, 180, or 270 on the outer edge. The image uses a symbolic representation rather than functioning as an actual compass, thus these detailed numerical markings are not visible.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the embossed compass face retain the original eight-pointed star-like radial pattern with symmetrical arms extending from the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the design on the perfume bottle does not retain the compass's original eight-pointed star-like radial pattern. Instead, the bottle's top is embossed with different decorative details, likely intended for aesthetics rather than preserving the compass's functional design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the body of the perfume bottle perfectly circular in shape, matching the original compass’s outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual inspection of Image B, the perfume bottle itself appears to be circular in shape, matching the general outline and form of the original compass from Image A. The original compass is circular, and the perfume bottle reflects this circular design, suggesting intentional stylistic mimicry.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the cap of the perfume bottle feature engraved cartographic details such as a compass rose and intersecting grid lines, matching those seen on the map fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cap of the perfume bottle does have engraving details that suggest a vintage, cartographic theme reminiscent of maps. However, it does not explicitly feature a compass rose or intersecting grid lines that closely match the specific details observed on the map fragments. The engravings are decorative and thematic but not directly mirroring the maps.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a small central raised dot or hub at the exact center of the embossed compass face, corresponding to the original needle pivot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Reviewing the features on the perfume bottle’s top, which resembles the compass face as per Image B, there's no small central raised dot or hub visible, which one would expect for a compass needle pivot. The design on the bottle eschews this in favor of other embossed decorative elements.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the outer ring of the embossed compass face clearly delineated with fine engravings and consistent spacing between degree marks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outer ring of the perfume bottle mimicking the compass face does not show fine engravings or consistent spacing between degree marks that are characteristic and necessary for compass functionality. These are absent as the design prioritizes ornamental aspects rather than practical compass features.",
