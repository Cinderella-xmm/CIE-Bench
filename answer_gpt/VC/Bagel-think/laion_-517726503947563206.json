      "question": "Is the text \"Aurora\" visible on the side of the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship's surface appears transformed with geometric patterns resembling ice or crystals, which obscure any text that might have been visible on the ship's side. World knowledge of ship designs suggests that names are often prominently displayed on the side, but in this image, such details are obfuscated by the design change, making the name 'Aurora' indiscernible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the registration number \"QV-8880\" visible on the hull of the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hull of the ship in Image B is obscured with an ice-like design that covers any text-related markings. These markings, common for identifying vessels, are not visible due to the edited texture, which eliminates any clear registration numbers from sight.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is a red flag visible at the top of the ship’s mast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the upper part of the ship in Image B, there is no red flag visible. The transformation has rendered the mast into an iced structure, and the typically noticeable color contrast provided by a red flag on a neutral background is not present.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the ship oriented in a side profile view, facing toward the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ship in Image B is depicted with a clear side profile view facing the right, as indicated by the visible bow pointing to the right and the structure running parallel to the viewer's perspective, matching the typical orientation of a ship shown in profile view.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the ship depicted as floating on a body of water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship is shown to be positioned on the water’s surface. The water beneath it gives the appearance of flotation, consistent with photographic depictions of ships and common maritime scenarios where vessels float on bodies of water. The surface interaction suggests buoyancy.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the ship positioned near the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B positions the ship notably towards the center. It occupies a central portion of the landscape, dominating the composition, which keeps the ship as a central focal point despite the iced transformation, enhancing visible centering within the frame context.",
