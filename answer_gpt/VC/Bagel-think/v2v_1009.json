      "question": "Are the carrot slices clearly circular in shape with visible concentric rings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot slices can be seen as circular in shape, which is typical for slices of carrot. They also have visible concentric rings, which is a natural feature of carrots due to the internal structure of their growth. This observation is consistent with common knowledge about carrots, confirming the image shows a realistic depiction of sliced carrots.",

      "question": "Do the cauliflower florets retain their natural branching structure and clustered bud formation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cauliflower florets are represented with their natural branching structure, including the clustered buds that are typical of cauliflower heads. This is evident through the visible texture and arrangement of the florets, which is consistent with the common appearance of cauliflower.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are all the carrots and cauliflower florets contained within the bowl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows all the carrot slices and cauliflower florets neatly contained within the confines of the bowl, without any spilling out. This indicates that the vegetables are well organized within the bowl, a common practice when preparing food items in such a manner.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the arrangement of vegetables in the bowl natural and non-symmetrical, with both carrots and cauliflower present in similar quantities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While observing Image B, both carrots and cauliflower are present in roughly similar quantities. However, there is a noticeable symmetrical pattern or arrangement, as seen in the systematic distribution and positioning of the carrot slices and cauliflower florets. This differs from a more random or natural arrangement, which is often found in everyday situations. Therefore, based on this reasoning, the arrangement appears structured rather than natural and non-symmetrical.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the carrots distinctly orange and the cauliflower distinctly white in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrots are shown in a prominent orange color, and the cauliflower florets are distinctly white. These color characteristics align with what is commonly known about these vegetables, thus confirming an accurate depiction of their typical colors.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there multiple distinct carrot slices and cauliflower florets visible in the bowl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays multiple carrot slices and numerous cauliflower florets within the bowl. This is evident by their distinct separation and repeated presence throughout the bowl. It is consistent with the depiction of a typical bowl containing multiple pieces of vegetables.",
      "weight": 1,
