      "question": "Are two stone columns visible on the left and right sides of the background, framing the landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left and right sides of the landscape in the background are flanked by structural elements that resemble stone columns. These are consistent elements often used in paintings to frame a central subject against a natural backdrop. This observation is reinforced by the traditional architectural style seen in the image, where columns serve a framing rather than a functional purpose.",

      "question": "Are both hands positioned in the lap, supporting an animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both hands of the subject are positioned in her lap, holding a small animal that resembles a lamb or sheep. This arrangement of hands and the presence of a small animal being held is a common motif, suggesting care or affection. The positioning is evident from the visual cues such as the natural curvature of arms and the placement towards her body.",

      "question": "Does the dress have a square neckline without a high collar or round shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neckline of the dress is distinctly squared, with straight edges forming a rectangular shape around the neck. There is no evidence of a high collar or rounded neckline, which would typically have a curved or sloping appearance. A square neckline is visually apparent from the linear structure on the upper part of the dress.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there two horizontal bands—one across the chest and one at the waist—on the dress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress features two prominent horizontal bands: one across the chest area and another at the waist. These bands provide visual distinction and are common in historical dress designs to emphasize shape and structure. The bands are clearly visible due to the contrasting colors and placement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a necklace with a rectangular pendant hanging from a thin chain at the center of the chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a necklace visible with a square or slightly rectangular pendant attached to a chain, which hangs centrally on the chest. This accessory is typical for adding elegance or focus to the clothing, enhancing the overall appearance of the subject.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the subject’s head turned slightly forward, with eyes looking directly at the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Even though the face is blurred, in Image B, the overall posture, including the direction of the neck and the angle of the head, suggests a forward orientation. The expectation of direct eye contact is typical in portraits for engaging with the viewer and creating a connection, although explicitly seeing the eyes is not possible due to the blur.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sleeves of the dress start at the shoulders and show a puffed or rounded style at the top, which is indicative of certain historical fashion designs meant to add volume and distinction to the upper arm area. The visual appearance aligns with the rounded style often seen in formal dresses from historical contexts.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the distant landscape beyond the columns includes formations that resemble a mountain range. The natural contour of these lines suggests elevation changes typical of mountains, enhancing the depth and realism of the scenic background.",
