      "question": "Is the red-and-white checkered keffiyeh still present on the man’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is depicted wearing a traditional Middle Eastern headdress that resembles a keffiyeh, which is typically red-and-white checkered based on cultural knowledge. The visual cues in Image B suggest the presence of this item as it appears similar to traditional keffiyehs, and matches world knowledge of its typical appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a monocle positioned over the man’s right eye?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no visual indication in Image B to suggest the presence of a monocle placed over the man's right eye. The artwork does not highlight any distinct monocle, nor does it provide visual cues typical of monocle usage, such as string or outline.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the man holding an open newspaper with both hands and looking at it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the man holding a document that closely resembles a newspaper based on its rectangular shape and appearance of print layout. It is open, suggesting the man is looking at it, supported by both hands holding it characteristic of reading posture.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there Arabic script visible in the top-right corner of the newspaper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B shows various inscriptions that could resemble Arabic script, the specific appearance of text does not clearly indicate the language or its placement, thus making it difficult to definitively identify Arabic script in the top-right of the newspaper.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a desk setting with three open books. The man stands against a backdrop with no visible desk setup or open books similar to Image A, hence lacking visual cues of desk items or arrangement.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is not depicted seated at a desk. He appears to stand in the image with a decorative border around him, without cues suggesting the presence of a desk or necessary features like surface and legs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "question": "Is a patterned Persian-style rug visible beneath the desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks any indication of an interior setting that includes a desk or visible floor items such as a Persian-style rug. The backdrop and context do not suggest the existence of such elements as seen in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of a window or any external light source possible through such means. The background is furnished with artwork rather than objects indicating illumination conditions like daylight through a window.",
