      "question": "Is the cardinal’s body predominantly bright red with a black facial mask?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal's body is indeed predominantly bright red, as indicated by the vivid and consistent red coloration across the bird's body. The facial mask of the cardinal is depicted as black, covering the area around the eyes and beak, which is characteristic of cardinal birds. The visual information combined with common knowledge about cardinals corroborates this observation.",

      "question": "Does the blue jay have a blue crest and wings with alternating blue and white bars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the analysis reveals that the blue jay possesses a prominent blue crest on its head. The wings are adorned with distinctive alternating bars of blue and white, typical of blue jays. This feature is a well-known attribute of blue jays, which helps in identifying them. The world knowledge about the physical traits of blue jays supports this conclusion.",

      "question": "Is there visible snow resting on the cardinal’s head and back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal is depicted without snow on its head and back. This contrasts with the typical snowy environment, suggesting either an indoor setting or intentional artistic omission of snow. The visual cues in the edited image do not show snow accumulation, leading to the conclusion of its absence.",

      "question": "Does the blue jay have a black beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blue jay in Image B is illustrated with its beak appearing darker in color, which can generally be associated with black. The depiction is consistent with the typical characteristics of a blue jay's beak, reinforced through common understanding of bird features. Thus, the recognition of a black beak is supported by visual and world knowledge.",

      "question": "Are the birds perched on snow-covered pine branches with visible needles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, it is observed that the cardinal and blue jay are not perched on snow-covered pine branches. Instead, they appear in a more stylized environment with artificial elements such as icicles and snowflakes indicating a diorama-like setting, lacking natural foliage and visible pine needles, which suggests that the branches do not fit this description.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal's beak is distinctly orange-red, in line with its typical real-world appearance. The beak color is vibrant and distinguishable, contributing to common recognition of cardinal birds whose beaks are known for this coloration.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the cardinal and blue jay in distinct vertical sections, exemplified by the partition in the box model setting. This segregation is visually apparent, reflecting the divided layout where each bird occupies its own space. Such placement can be inferred from the clear partition created by the structural design, aligning with aesthetic segmentation.",
