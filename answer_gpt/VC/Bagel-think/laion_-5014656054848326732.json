    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the black-framed glasses with rectangular lenses and visible reflections on the lenses still present on the man's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's face is obscured due to editing, but from the visible parts, there are no signs or indications of black-framed glasses present. The size of the blur suggests that any such glasses would not be hidden unless they were also edited out. Therefore, it's logical to conclude that glasses are not present.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the trimmed beard and mustache, particularly the defined jawline coverage and upper lip growth, still present on the man's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's face is entirely blurred, making it impossible to determine any facial hair characteristics such as a beard or mustache. Since nothing else suggests their presence, they should be considered absent in this context.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the light brown, textured, swept-back hairstyle with visible volume and side-parting still present on the man's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Even with a blurred face, the man's hairstyle is visible above the face area, showing the characteristics of being light brown, textured, and swept-back with volume. These qualities are consistent with the original description.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both hands positioned near the writing object (book), with the right hand showing a grip-like pose and the left hand partially extended toward the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's hands are positioned closer to the books; the left hand rests on top of a stack, while the right hand is more to the side, supporting the body. This is a change from Image A where both hands were near the typewriter.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the table surface still a flat, white, matte plane with soft reflections and no visible texture or pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The table in Image B appears to have a more antiquated or classic look consistent with the setting, and the descriptive elements like color and detail do not match the image description from Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the lighting still coming from the front-left, creating a soft highlight on the left side of the face and a subtle shadow on the right side of the neck and shoulder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting seems more uniformly distributed and there is no visible shadowing pattern to suggest directional lighting as described. The styling and lighting adjustment match a different era and feel.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the man still seated with his torso slightly leaned forward, head tilted upward and to the right, eyes looking up and away?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's posture differs; he is seated more upright, in contrast to being slightly leaned forward as in the original description from Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is there a large, open, leather-bound book placed on the table directly in front of the man?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, open large leather-bound books are present, consistent with such an item being placed directly in front of the man, aligning with a different setting from Image A.",
