    "Question": "Q1: Does the tiger retain its distinctive stripe pattern?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object representing the tiger is a stylized, chibi version which maintains the classic striped pattern typical of tigers. This is evident because, despite the cartoonish and simplified form, the stripes are drawn in the correct positions to resemble those of a real tiger. This use of simplified yet characteristic features is common in chibi or cartoon art to ensure recognizability. Therefore, the tiger retains its distinctive stripe pattern.",

    "Question": "Q5: Does the tiger maintain a seated posture similar to the original image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the posture of the chibi tiger is not indicative of a seated position similar to an actual or lifelike tiger, as demonstrated in Image A. Instead, it stands more upright in a typical cartoonish stance featuring rounded, simplified limbs that suggest a playful or animated pose rather than a naturalistic seated one. This change aligns with chibi styling that often aims at a cute, non-realistic portrayal.",
