        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly man is illustrated with a cartoon-like appearance.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a brown leather pouch hanging from the waist of the man. The cartoon version seems to exclude this detail, preferring to streamline the man's attire instead, which is common in artistic renditions where some real-world details are omitted for simplicity.",
