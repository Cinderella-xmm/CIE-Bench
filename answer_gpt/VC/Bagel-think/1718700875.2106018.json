      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes of the figurine dark brown in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine does not have distinctly colored eyes visible due to the blurred face. Given the context of the image, where specific facial details are obscured, I conclude that there is no visual evidence to suggest the presence of dark brown eyes.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the nose of the figurine black and oval-shaped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display distinct features of the figurine's nose due to the blurred face. The obscured facial features prevent confirming the nose color or shape, thus it cannot be recognized as black and oval-shaped.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the figurine retain the white, curly fur in a poodle-style grooming pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine wears a hairstyle that resembles white, curly fur arranged in a poodle grooming style, similar to the often seen decorative hairstyles on historical figures. This is inferred from the visible hair design, despite the blurred face.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there large, layered pink ruffles on both sides of the figurineâ€™s dress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows large, layered pink ruffles on both sides of the figurine's dress, notably visible as part of its elaborate design. The presence of these ruffles is a key feature of the attire.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a detailed silver brooch located at the center of the chest area of the dress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a gold medallion-like accessory at the center of the chest area. It can clearly be distinguished as intricate but is not silver. Thus, no detailed silver brooch is observed here.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the figurine in a side profile pose with the head turned slightly forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the figurine in a frontal pose rather than a side profile. The orientation of the figurine is centered, indicating that it stands forward rather than turned to the side.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the dress maintain a pastel color scheme with light blue and pink hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dress of the figurine in Image B consists of pastel colors, with noticeable light blue and pink hues contributing to the overall design. This color palette is consistent with a pastel theme.",
