    "Question": "Q1: Is the subject depicted in a horizontal plank pose, supported by hands and toes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is represented as a small figurine encased in a clear plastic box, rather than a real human performing a plank pose. The figurine appears to be in a running-like stance, with bent arms and legs, and is not supported by hands and toes on a flat surface. Therefore, the subject is not in a horizontal plank pose.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the subject wearing a sleeveless tank top and shorts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine appears to be wearing a black sleeveless tank top and black shorts. This is visually evident from the attire of the small model within the display case, which corresponds to a sleeveless top and shorts, common for athletic wear.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the background maintain a clean and minimalistic aesthetic?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a simple peach-toned backdrop without any additional decorations or complex patterns, maintaining a clean and minimalist aesthetic. The focus is primarily on the figurine and its display case, with the backdrop providing a non-distracting background.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the subject's muscles visibly defined, indicating physical strength?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is a stylized figurine that lacks the level of detail required to showcase defined muscles or indicate physical strength. Its simplistic design leans more toward a general representation without realistic muscle definition.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the subject looking upward, conveying focus and determination?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine representing the subject does not have defined facial features that clearly indicate an upward gaze. As this is a stylized toy figure, the orientation of its head does not convey emotions such as focus or determination in the same way a real human expression would. Thus, it does not seem to illustrate the subject looking upward.",
    "answer": "No"
