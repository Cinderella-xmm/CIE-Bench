    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a long, continuous road-like structure extending into the distance, serving as the central axis of the composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a prominent geometrical shape that resembles the form of a road, stretching from the foreground towards the background. The linear perspective and arrangement of shapes suggest continuous extension, common in road depictions. Using world knowledge, such a formation usually hints at a road or path in artwork.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible diagonal streaks or patterns indicating falling rain across the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible diagonal streaks or patterns that resemble rain. The visual design consists of abstract and geometric shapes without lines that typically suggest rain. World knowledge indicates that rain in art is usually depicted with linear, diagonal or vertical streaks, none of which are present in this edit.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there tall vertical structures with horizontal crossbars positioned along the right side of the road?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains visibly tall geometric shapes resembling poles, with horizontal elements at the top. These structures are positioned along the right side, simulating telegraph or utility poles beside a roadâ€”a common scene in landscape compositions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there tree-like forms present on both sides of the road, aligned with the guardrails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, abstract shapes suggest the presence of tree-like formations on each side of the road. These forms are located alongside the road, typically seen in real-life foliage arrangements along roads. World knowledge aids in identifying these formations based on the silhouette and typical patterns used in art to denote trees.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a visible division in the sky between dark clouds and a brighter, illuminated area near the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks a realistic or distinguishable sky division, as it's highly abstracted into geometric shapes. The absence of traditional sky elements means there isn't a clear separation between dark and illuminated areas, as might be seen in realistic imagery.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there barrier-like structures running along both edges of the road?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are abstract shapes resembling guardrails or barriers drawn alongside the road-like structure, common for depicting road boundaries in artistic renderings. Based on world knowledge, such elements are usually parallel to the road edges, which can be identified here.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a continuous yellow line running down the center of the road?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a prominent geometric line that runs centrally down the road-like structure, rendered in hues consistent with yellow. Such visual cues suggest it represents the center line often seen on roads. World knowledge about road markings informs this identification of the continuous line indicative of road division.",
