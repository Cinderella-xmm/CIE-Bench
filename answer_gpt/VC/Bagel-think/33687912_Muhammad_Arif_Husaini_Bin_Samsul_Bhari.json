    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the sun positioned low on the horizon, centered between the two silhouetted landmasses, and appearing as a bright, circular disc?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a notable artistic element—a large, mysterious structure with glowing colors—that replaces the view of the sun. There is no visible bright, circular disc in the sky. Although the horizon and the general position where the sun should be may remain unchanged, the presence of the artistic structure obscures the usual view of the sun. Therefore, the original sun position cannot be confirmed in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there two distinct silhouetted landmasses, one on the left and one on the right, framing the horizon and the sun?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed two silhouetted landmasses on each side. Despite the addition of the large, glowing structure near the horizon, the landmasses themselves remain visible and frame the horizon as they did in Image A. The presence of these landmasses is unaltered, and they continue to frame the structure in the center.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the water surface reflect the orange-red gradient of the sky, creating shimmering patterns that mirror the sunset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a water surface that continues to reflect the colors of the sky above. Although the large, glowing structure adds new colors and light, the foundational orange-red hues are still present in the water, maintaining the reflection pattern seen in Image A. The overall reflection still carries the orange-red gradient, indicating that the water surface continues to shimmer in a manner consistent with a sunset.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sky filled with a gradient of warm orange near the horizon transitioning to deeper red and maroon tones higher up?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky retains the gradient starting with warm orange close to the horizon and transitioning into deeper reds and maroon tones higher up. Despite the introduction of a new artistic element in the foreground, the sky's gradient remains largely unchanged and visible, making the pattern similar to what would be expected in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a clear, straight horizon line dividing the sky and water, with the sun resting directly on it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the horizon line is suggested, the large, glowing artistic structure obscures the direct view of it at the point where the sun would typically rest. This addition means there isn't a clear view of the horizon line with the sun resting on it. The structure disrupts the typical view of the horizon and sun alignment that would be otherwise visible.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there faint, thin clouds visible in the upper portion of the sky, partially illuminated by the sunset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows faint, thin clouds in the upper portion of the sky, similar to what one would expect in a sunset scene. These clouds are illuminated subtly by the sunset colors, enhancing the gradient and offering a consistent continuation of the scene from Image A. The clouds remain visible and affected by the light despite other alterations in the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the water continues to display gentle ripples and small waves, which indicates calm movement. This reflection and movement pattern is consistent with the original Image A's characteristics despite the central alteration. The water's texture maintains its general appearance, suggesting a tranquil scene.",
