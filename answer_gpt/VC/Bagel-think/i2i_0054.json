      "question": "Is the detailed texture of the elephant's skin, showing wrinkles and creases, preserved in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible texture on the elephant's skin, characterized by wrinkles and creases. This can be identified by the lines and folds apparent on the elephant's body, which indicate detail and texture in skin depiction. The retained texture reflects a realistic portrayal consistent with the common understanding of an elephant's skin appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the elephant's posture, including the raised front leg and curved trunk, retained in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the elephant in a posture where the front leg is distinctly raised, paired with a trunk that curves downwards towards the ground. These elements are eye-catching and notable in the elephant's stance, indicating its ability to move and interact with its environment. These features are preserved according to the visual cues in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the elephant's ears and trunk, consistent with its young age, maintained in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The proportions in Image B of the elephant’s ears and trunk are consistent with characteristics common to young elephants. The relatively large ears and elongated but not overly long trunk suggest its immature age compared to adult elephants, as these proportions are typical of juvenile elephants.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the elephant positioned on the rock edge, with its legs and trunk maintaining their relative placement to the rock surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant appears to have a defined edge beneath it, suggesting it is positioned on a surface akin to a rock edge. The position of its legs and trunk relative to this surface seems to be preserved, reflecting its spatial positioning similarly to how it would be visually understood in a natural environment.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the elephant face towards the right side of the image, preserving its profile orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's face is oriented towards the right, which is indicative of its profile posture. This alignment, where the body and trunk follow the direction towards the right side of the frame, mirrors a common way to depict an animal’s profile in imagery.",
