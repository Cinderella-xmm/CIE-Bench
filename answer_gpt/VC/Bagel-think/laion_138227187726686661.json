      "question": "Is the red football with white laces present in the quilt’s design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quilt is composed of building blocks resembling LEGO bricks, and there is no design featuring a red football with white laces visible. The design is abstract and consists of colorful bricks without any depiction of recognizable sports equipment.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the black-and-white soccer ball with hexagonal pattern present in the quilt’s design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the pattern is made up of colorful interlocking blocks and lacks any sports motifs, such as a black-and-white soccer ball with a hexagonal pattern. The quilt does not display individual ball designs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the orange basketball with black lines present in the quilt’s design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design of the quilt is abstract and formed by colorful plastic bricks. It does not feature specific sports equipment, such as an orange basketball with black lines. The abstract nature of the design precludes representation of detailed sports imagery.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the white baseball with red stitching present in the quilt’s design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's design substitutes detailed prints with a simplistic pattern composed of colorful interlocking bricks. A white baseball with red stitching is absent because the blocks do not form detailed images of sports balls.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the quilt composed of a grid of colored squares arranged in a patchwork pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quilt is constructed from interlocking blocks which create a pattern; unlike a traditional quilt made from fabric squares, it forms a block-based patchwork. This does not reflect a quilt in the traditional fabric sense but employs a similar concept spatially.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are blue and white stars present between the sports ball motifs in the quilt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's quilt features no stars or sports motifs, being exclusively comprised of colorful blocks. The absence of sports motifs or stars in the design distinguishes it from traditional quilt patterns.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the sports balls positioned in the same relative locations within the patchwork grid as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A features sports balls positioned within a colored grid framework. In contrast, Image B's colorful brick pattern lacks these sports motifs, indicating that the original sports ball positioning is not present in Image B.",
