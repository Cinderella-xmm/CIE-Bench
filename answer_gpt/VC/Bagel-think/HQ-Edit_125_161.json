      "question": "Is the herringbone-patterned wooden floor present and accurately rendered in the same layout and orientation as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the herringbone-patterned wooden floor is indeed present and maintains the same layout and orientation as in Image A. The texture and arrangement of the wooden planks form a distinctive herringbone pattern similar to that in the original image, indicating that the floor pattern has not been altered in the edited image.",

      "question": "Are the vertical and horizontal moldings of the wall paneling preserved, including the recessed rectangular panels and crown molding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vertical and horizontal moldings of the wall paneling, including the recessed rectangular panels and crown molding, remain intact. Image A features these elements as part of the classic wall design, which are visible and consistent in Image B as well, suggesting they have been preserved during the edit.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the oval-shaped skylight or oculus at the top of the spiral staircase still present and positioned centrally above the coil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the continuation of an oval-shaped opening positioned centrally above the spiral staircase, which aligns with the analogous position of the skylight observed in Image A. This suggests that the structural design featuring the skylight has been preserved in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the graphite pencil visible in the lower-right corner of the image, angled diagonally across the drawingâ€™s border?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, similar to Image A, there is a graphite pencil depicted in the lower-right corner of the image. The pencil is angled diagonally across the border of the drawing, a detail retained from the original image, highlighting the artist's intent and framing device.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a thin ruled border is enclosing the entire drawing with short perpendicular lines at each corner. This consistent element from Image A gives the drawing a finished look and frames the scene effectively.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the perspective of the scene maintain convergence toward the oval skylight at the top, with all architectural lines aligning accordingly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perspective convergence towards the oval skylight is preserved, similar to Image A. The architectural lines, especially those of the staircase and wall paneling, align towards the skylight, maintaining the original perspective, despite the presence of additional artistic elements like the dragon.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the tonal gradients on the walls and floor, particularly the darker shadows near the base and lighter areas under the skylight, preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the use of tonal gradients seen in Image A. The shadows remain darker near the base while lighter directly under the skylight. This consistent play of light and shadow helps maintain the scene's depth and three-dimensionality, enhancing the illusionistic effect of the drawing.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the individual wooden planks of the floor are illustrated with fine parallel lines to indicate their texture and grain, similar to Image A. This subtle textural detail is retained, contributing to the overall realism and craftsmanship of the drawing.",
