      "question": "Are the cheetahs still depicted in their original seated and standing postures on the earthen mound?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetahs are depicted with a steampunk aesthetic featuring goggles and mechanical enhancements. Despite these modifications, their posture remains unchanged. The cheetah in the foreground is seated on the earthen mound, and the cheetah behind stands with similar positioning as in Image A. This is confirmed by the visual cues showing their respective stances unaffected by the stylistic edits.",

      "question": "Is the earthen mound still present beneath the cheetahs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the distinctive steampunk design additions, the earthen mound is clearly visible and remains unchanged, serving as the base upon which the cheetahs are positioned. This is verified by recognizing the mound's texture and shape, which are retained from Image A.",

      "question": "Do the cheetahs retain their black-ringed tails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cheetahs in Image B maintain their original features like their black-ringed tails despite being stylized with steampunk elements. The tail of the seated cheetah is visible in front and the standing cheetah's tail is also discernible, which matches what is seen in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background altered to include steampunk towers, changing the original savanna setting. Image A showcases a more natural landscape with visible greenery and horizon line, emphasizing the outdoor environment. Image B introduces mechanical structures, notably altering the original landscape.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cheetahsâ€™ relative positioning in Image B remains consistent with Image A. The seated cheetah is in the front and the standing one is behind, evidently kept unchanged despite the steampunk embellishments added to their appearance.",
