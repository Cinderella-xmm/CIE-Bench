      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'SEARCH FOR A STAR' is located on the left side of the image, above the text 'Character Art Directory 2018'. This is evident from the visual presence of the title in large fonts, which is clearly visible and prominently placed within the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain the text 'RISING STAR'. Instead, on the right side, there is a wooden plaque with a star and the text 'ASSCRK', along with the 'Sudio Digital' logo. Based on visual interpretation, there is no indication of 'RISING STAR' text in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text reads 'SUDIO DIGITAL'. The 'SUMO DIGITAL' text is not present. This distinction is clear through visual examination, as the text 'SUDIO DIGITAL' accompanies the symbol above 'Character Art Directory 2018' and near the wooden plaque.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Character Art Directory 2018' is visibly present in Image B, located towards the bottom, beneath the 'SEARCH FOR A STAR' logo and accompanying the 'Sudio Digital' logo. This fact can be ascertained by recognizing the uniform font and position in the overall design layout.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the text 'Character Art Directory 2018' appears horizontally centered. The positioning aligns centrally with respect to the width of the image, making it appear balanced and symmetrically placed as opposed to favoring any side.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Search for a Star' logo is positioned directly above the 'Character Art Directory 2018' text. However, there is no 'Rising Star' logo present. Instead, a wooden plaque is located to the right of 'Search for a Star'. Thus, only one of those logos is positioned above the text.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no 'Rising Star' logo in Image B; therefore, the layout of 'Sumo Digital' beneath that logo is not applicable. Image B contains the 'Sudio Digital' logo near the wooden plaque, but it is not located beneath any 'Rising Star' logo.",
