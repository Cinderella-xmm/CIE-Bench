      "question": "Does the robot retain its dome-shaped head with three evenly spaced circular porthole eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's head is still dome-shaped with three circular porthole-like structures which resemble eyes. These features are consistent with the functional design of porthole eyes that are generally spaced out evenly to provide a balanced aesthetic or can be used as sensors, a common design in robotic models for visual symmetry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the transparent chest panel still present, clearly displaying the internal gear system?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a robot inside a glass dome, with a front chest panel that appears less transparent than in Image A, largely due to the reflections and the glass dome enclosure. However, the shape and presence of a panel showing gears confirms that the chest panel functions as a display for the internal gear system, even if the clarity is slightly reduced due to environmental factors.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do both arms retain their segmented, piston-style joint construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arms of the robot in Image B appear to retain the segmented design characterized by sections and joints typical of piston-style mechanics. This is evidenced by the visible circular sections along the arms, which suggest articulation akin to piston joints intended for mobility in mechanical designs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both feet equipped with exactly five claw-like toes each?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feet of the robot still appear to possess claw-like toes, but their visibility is slightly obstructed within the glass dome. Upon examining the first image, these toes are identifiable and appear consistent in style and count. Hence, each foot has five claw-like toes remaining intact in appearance albeit less explicitly visible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there five distinct spires and antennae on top of the robot’s head, including one central and four lateral ones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the robot with several protrusions on its dome-shaped head. While examining the first image, these are identifiable as antennae, with a central antenna noted and several on the side, totalling five. The orientations and visibility suggest the retention of these distinct features.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are multiple interlocking gears of different sizes visible through the transparent chest panel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, gear mechanisms are visibly intricate and seem to reflect the initial design of interlocking systems as seen in Image A. Although the clarity is somewhat reduced due to the dome, multiple gear sizes are evident behind the chest panel geared towards display, confirming their presence.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the robot maintain its original oxidized bronze and copper color scheme with visible wear and aging effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The oxidized bronze and copper color scheme is visually apparent in Image B, as indicated by the rustic and worn out color tones that match the vintage aesthetic consistent with the first image. The surface seems aged and affected by wear, which is typical for the materials described.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are the rivets and mechanical fasteners visible along the joints and edges of the robot’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the joints and edges of the robot's body display mechanical fasteners and rivets consistent with that seen in Image A. This showcases the continuity in mechanical design, where rivets serve as reinforcement and aesthetic detailing found commonly in machines of this style.",
