      "question": "Does the image retain the orange tabby fur pattern with distinctive stripe markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kitten has clear orange tabby fur with prominent stripe markings. These patterns are characteristic of tabby cats, with darker markings creating noticeable stripes, which are visible on the kitten’s body and head. Common sense suggests these natural patterns in felines convey the identity of an orange tabby. Therefore, the pattern in Image B has been retained.",

      "question": "Are the kitten's eyes still green with a clear, open expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the kitten with its green eyes visible, and they appear bright and open. The expression and eye color contribute to the kitten's lively appearance. The eyes are a significant feature for recognition in animals. Therefore, the kitten's eyes have remained green and are open.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the kitten's pink nose and surrounding white whiskers present and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kitten’s pink nose is visible along with white whiskers extending from the area around the nose. These details are crucial characteristics that define a kitten's face and are typically untouched unless digitally altered significantly. Based on this observation, these features have remained unchanged.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the kitten remain in a lying position with its paws stretched forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the kitten lying down, with its paws positioned forward, maintaining a relaxed stance. This position, common in resting cats, suggests comfort and is usually unchanged without physical interaction or repositioning. Thus, the kitten retains its lying position with paws stretched forward.",

      "question": "Is the background still softly blurred, maintaining focus on the kitten?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background remains softly blurred, which helps to keep the viewer's focus on the kitten in the foreground. The depth of field effect, where the subject is clear against a blurred background, highlights the kitten effectively and remains a consistent visual approach in photography of animals to draw attention to them.",
