      "question": "Is the drainpipe releasing water onto the ground visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visual representation of a drainpipe on the left side of the image, presumably made of metal. The image shows water flowing from this pipe and hitting the ground, which is consistent with the depiction of running water being discharged from the drainpipe. This scenario is a common representation of a typical outdoor drainpipe function, reinforcing the assessment.",

      "question": "Are the orange wall and brown door present in the background of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes an orange-colored wall with a distinct brown door, which are clear visual elements. This is evident from the top left side to the right side of the image, signifying typical architectural features which connect to real-world structures.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the chibi character wear a green raincoat and green boots in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi character in Image B is dressed in a green raincoat, as indicated by the hood and the color tone of the upper body clothing. The character is wearing shoes that are not green; thus, it logically follows that they are not depicted in green boots like the real person might be. Stylistically, these elements are common in cartoon or simplified figures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the chibi character positioned in front of the wall and drainpipe in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character is placed spatially in the foreground, seemingly in front of the wall and drainpipe. This typical arrangement suggests a relationship where the figure is interacting directly with elements such as the falling water from the gutter pipe.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question": "Is the cobblestone ground texture visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground lacks the distinct cobblestone texture. The surface appears smoother in comparison, unlike the more defined cobblestone pattern visible in Image A. This is derived from a common understanding of street and walkway textures, where cobblestone is generally more detailed and pronounced.",
