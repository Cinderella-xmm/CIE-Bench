      "question": "Does the zebra retain its black and white stripe pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra clearly shows its distinctive black and white striped pattern. This pattern is a unique characteristic of zebras and is clearly visible across its body. Based on this visual cue, the zebra's stripe pattern remains unchanged.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the zebra's body structure, including its legs and torso, intact?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's body structure appears to be intact. The legs and torso are clearly delineated and natural-looking, consistent with the anatomy of a zebra. There are no visible alterations or distortions that would suggest otherwise.",

      "model_answer": "yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the watering hole still present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a section of water at the bottom right corner, indicating the presence of a watering hole. This is evidenced by the zebra bending down as if to drink, which is common behavior at such a location.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question": "Are the surrounding rocks and dry earth background still visible?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surrounding environment such as rocks and the dry, earthy background are clearly visible. The arrangement of rocks and dry earth form a naturalistic setting typically found on a savannah or dry landscape where zebras populate.",

      "model_answer": "yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question": "Does the zebra's tail retain its natural shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "The zebra's tail in Image B appears to retain its natural shape, which is typically thin and has a tuft of hair at the end. Its position is thought to be consistent with that of a zebra standing still or grazing, as no modifications can be discerned in the image.",
