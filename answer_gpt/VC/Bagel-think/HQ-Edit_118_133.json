    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the complex scrollwork and floral engraving pattern visible on the body, lid, and spout of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body, lid, and spout of the object have a predominantly smooth surface without intricate patterns. There is some decorative detail around the top section and base, but the overall surface lacks the complex engravings seen in traditional ornamental teapots. This suggests the absence of comprehensive scrollwork and floral engraving patterns on the object's main areas.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the object have a domed lid topped with a small finial at the apex?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object features a lid that tapers towards the top and is topped with what appears to be a flame-like element rather than a finial typically characterized by a small ornamental piece at the apex. This design choice deviates from the traditional domed lid with a central finial.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the object supported by a three-legged pedestal base with decorative feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object does not rest on a three-legged base but rather has a round, continuous base. Decorative feet are not present, and the base design aligns more closely with a flat pedestal rather than segmented legs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a curved handle attached to the left side of the object, extending upward and backward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a handle that is gracefully curved and attached to the left side of the object, extending upward and backward similar to the design found on classic teapots. This visually matches the described feature.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a long, curved spout extending from the right side of the objectâ€™s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B includes a long, curved spout that originates from the right side of the body, mimicking the familiar spout found on traditional teapot designs, affirming the presence of a spout with the specified characteristics.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the object placed on a polished wooden surface with a clear reflection visible beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the object positioned on a shiny, wooden surface, where a distinct reflection of the object can be observed in the surface beneath. This matches the description of a polished surface with a visible reflection.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there decorative metal fittings where the handle attaches to the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handle's attachment point appears to have some decorative elements, but they don't distinctly resemble traditional metal fittings, suggesting a simpler design. This implies the absence of complex decorative metal joins between the handle and the body.",
