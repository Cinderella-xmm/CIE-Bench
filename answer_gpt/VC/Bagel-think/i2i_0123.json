      "question": "Does the parking meter maintain its black cylindrical shape and color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both parking meters display a consistent black cylindrical shape and color as seen in the typical design of parking meters. World knowledge indicates that parking meters generally have a color scheme meant to resist visibility-enhancing designs, such as bright colors, which supports the recognition of the meters as unchanged structurally and colored similarly.",

      "question": "Is the coin slot visible on both parking meters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B shows that the coin slot's location on each meter appears unchanged, notably seen with the prominent slot for coin insertion. Coin slots are vital components of parking meters, typically visible on the exterior for user access, indicating no visual obstruction due to the presence of added objects.",

      "question": "Is the digital display on the right parking meter unchanged and labeled \"1995\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The digital display on the right parking meter in Image B indeed remains labeled with '1995', and visually, it appears unchanged. With digital displays, any alteration would be expected to involve the text or numerical readout, neither of which are altered based on the image analysis.",

      "question": "Is the scene background, including the sidewalk, street, cars, and buildings, consistent with the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains all characteristics of the background environment seen in Image A, such as the layout and arrangement of the sidewalk, street beyond the meters, and presence of vehicles and buildings. Visual cues between both images demonstrate an unchanged urban scene backdrop.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the numbers on the left meter (\"20487\") still present in some form, like being part of the robotic dog's design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows the presence of a robotic toy figure in the coin retrieval area of the left meter, while the left meter itself no longer displays the number '20487'. '34887' appears to remain on the top portion of the meter in a similar position to Image A's show of '34887'. No such integration of '20487' is evidenced within the toy figure's design.",
