    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the radial floral and scrollwork pattern with symmetrical swirls and leaf-like motifs present around the central area of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central area of the liquor bottle features a label with elaborate typography and a decorative border, which does not exhibit classic scrollwork or floral motifs. The visual cues do not suggest the presence of a radial floral and scrollwork pattern. Commonly, such designs might be more aligned with intricate timepieces or vintage metalwork. The label tends to have graphic rather than ornamental motifs as found on objects like watches or jewelry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the Roman numerals I through XII arranged in a circular sequence around the central label or design element?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a bottle with a label that prominently features text but not Roman numerals. The presence of Roman numerals is characteristic of clock faces, indicating the passage of time. The bottle label instead features brand name text central to its design without any layout resembling a clock face sequence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the decorative patterns exhibit clear embossed relief with visible depth and shadowing, indicating raised surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the label on the bottle does not show embossed relief or shadowing indicative of raised designs. The design on the bottle is flat and printed, typical for beverage labels, whereas embossed patterns are more likely to appear on items designed for tactile detail and luxury, such as some metalwork.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a clearly defined central circular element positioned at the geometric center of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a bottle with a label that has a decorative graphic element but is not specifically circular at the geometric center. The focal aspect of the bottle design centers more around the square and rectangular elements of the label. Circular elements are typical for designs that invoke wheel or clock structures.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are small decorative dots and filigree details integrated into the scrollwork, particularly at junctions and tips of curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle's label does not display scrollwork with intricate decorative filigrees or dots. The design is more graphic and textual, unlike the delicate design work seen in jewelry or metal engravings which often include such detailed embellishments.",
