      "question": "Are the carrots depicted in a bright orange color with their rounded-tapered shape preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrots are clearly depicted with a bright orange color. Their shape appears to be more rounded rather than the typical tapered shape commonly associated with carrots. The rounded shape makes them distinct from traditional carrot imagery, suggesting a deviation in form while maintaining the bright orange hue typical of carrots.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the carrots topped with bright green serrated leaves with a lobed appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrots have leaves that are bright green, consistent with healthy carrot tops. The leaves show a serrated and lobed appearance, matching the typical structure of carrot greens, which are usually lush, green, and have lobed serrated edges.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the soil texture surrounding the carrotsâ€™ roots preserved showing they are rooted in soil rather than snow or ice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrots appear to be surrounded by a white substance that resembles snow rather than soil. Snow and ice are typically depicted as white and reflective, which contrasts with the dark, granular appearance of soil that surrounds plant roots. This suggests that the environment in Image B is icy rather than a typical earthy setting.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the carrots positioned in a way that shows they are partially underground, consistent with their natural growth pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrots are shown emerging from a white, snowy surface. While they appear partially embedded, the setting suggests they are not underground in soil as they naturally would be, but rather placed in a snowy environment, which deviates from the typical growth pattern seen in plants.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the carrots have visible surface textures like natural ridges or marks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The carrots in Image B exhibit visible surface textures with natural ridges or marks. These textural details are typical of carrots, which often have subtle lines or ridges running along their surface due to growth patterns and environmental factors.",
