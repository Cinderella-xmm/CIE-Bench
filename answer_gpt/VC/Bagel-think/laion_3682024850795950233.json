      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandwich character's bread slices have been stylized to appear as cartoon-like, smooth surfaces, removing the grainy and porous texture seen in Image A.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lettuce is represented in a stylized cartoon form that retains the green color but is simplified in its shape.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'AMERICA'S' is replaced by ACRCA displayed on the bread slice, which doesn't match the 'AMERICA'S' in brown serif font seen in Image A. Therefore, the style and positioning do not align with the original image.",

    },
    {
