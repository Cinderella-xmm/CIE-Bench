      "question": "Is the diamond-cut pattern on the decanter preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the decanter displays a diamond-cut pattern, but it is significantly simplified and does not retain the level of detail seen in Image A. The pattern appears more uniform and stylized, suggesting that while the pattern is preserved in a simplified form, it lacks the intricate detailing of the original.",

      "question": "Is the white foam layer present on top of the liquid in the glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass is depicted as a smooth, featureless object without any liquid or foam. There is no white foam or any representation of liquid. The glass is solid and opaque, emphasizing the absence of foam compared to the realistic depiction in Image A.",

      "question": "Are visible flames and glowing embers present in the fireplace in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stylized depiction of the fireplace where the flames and glowing embers are prominently visible, appearing somewhat abstract but definitely present. This contrasts with Image A, where the flames and embers are depicted with realistic detail.",

      "question": "Is the bottle opener shaped with a D-shaped opening and a long handle, matching its original form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle opener retains the D-shaped opening and a long handle, echoing the form found in Image A. Both images show the opener clearly with the same basic structure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positions of the decanter, glass, and opener match those in Image A. The decanter is to the right of the glass, and the opener is placed in front, maintaining the same spatial arrangement.",

      "question": "Is the wooden table surface with visible grain texture present beneath the objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks visible wood grain texture beneath the objects. The table surface appears very smooth and featureless, deviating from the clear, textured wood grain seen in Image A, which shows a realistic wooden table.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the liquid level in the glass approximately near the rim, and in the decanter about halfway up?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass and decanter are depicted without any visible liquid levels. Instead, these objects are solid, with no transparent qualities or liquid presence compared to Image A. Therefore, there is no observable liquid level.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a simplified brick pattern is present around the fireplace. It appears stylized and less detailed compared to the realistic bricks in Image A, but a pattern is still visible, maintaining the concept of a brick fireplace in the background.",
