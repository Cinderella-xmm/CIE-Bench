        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the facial features are blurred, making it impossible to assess the shape of her eyes, nose, and mouth. No specific features can be determined. Therefore, any comparison regarding these details would lead to the conclusion that the facial structure is not retained in the edited image.",
