      "question": "Are the gingham accents on the cuffs and back bow still present and crisp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cuffs and back bow appear to be altered to a solid dark color rather than retaining the gingham pattern seen in Image A. The accents are not present and hence can't be described as crisp. Common sense dictates that gingham patterns are typically recognized by their checkered design, which is missing in the second image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dress retain its original structure with long sleeves, a gathered waistline, and a flared skirt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the dress still has long sleeves similar to Image A, along with indications of a gathered waistline and a flared skirt. These features align closely with the original dress structure seen in Image A. This conclusion is drawn from recognizing typical dress designs that incorporate gathered waistlines and flaring for style and fit.",

      "question": "Is the \"Nebraska Huskers\" text area still located in the same position on the dress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is text embellished across the chest area of the dress, which is indeed the same position where the 'Nebraska Huskers' text appeared in Image A. Although the text content has changed in Image B, the location remains unaltered, reflecting consistency in design layout.",

      "question": "Is the dress predominantly red, even if the shade has been deepened?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dress in a burgundy hue, deviating from the pure red seen in Image A. While the shade is in the red family, it is clearly a darker burgundy rather than the soft red tone of the original. This deduction is based on a color analysis from the image where burgundy typically represents a deepened red hue.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The presence of a gathered waistline in Image B is visually identifiable, corresponding with traditional dress designs which utilize gathering at the waist for stylistic elements and fit enhancement, similar to Image A.",
