      "question": "Is the coarse, slightly cracked texture of the largest tortilla chip retained, including visible salt crystals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tortilla chip characters are depicted with a simplified, cartoonish style typical of comic illustrations. The surface details, like the coarse texture or salt crystals, are not the focus; instead, the design emphasizes bold lines and a single eye on the chips. This differs from a photographic depiction where such detailed texture would be central. Thus, the retention of specific surface details like a coarse, slightly cracked texture with visible salt crystals is not observed in the cartoon representation of Image B.",

      "question": "Is the golden-brown color of the largest tortilla chip preserved, with natural tonal variation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chips are illustrated in a stylized, colored, and simplified manner. While they have a consistent golden-brown color typical of such chips, the natural tonal variation found in more detailed, realistic images is missing. The color is rendered uniformly to suit the comic style, lacking the subtle tonal variations that would be seen in a realistic depiction.",

      "question": "Is the chunky, uneven texture of the guacamole mound preserved, showing visible avocado pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guacamole becomes part of a comic scene, with its texture rendered in a cartoon style. This means the detailed, chunky texture you would see in a photographic or realistic image like Image A is replaced with flat, simplified artwork. The focus in Image B is more on conveying a scene rather than detailing food textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the green-yellow gradient of the guacamole preserved, showing natural avocado color variation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guacamole is depicted more as a flat color fill within the comic, lacking the subtle green-yellow gradient indicating color variation typical of real avocados. The simplicity of comic art doesn't lend itself to illustrating the gradient effect seen in natural food depictions.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the chip and guacamole rendered with realistic material properties, avoiding glossy or plastic-like finishes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction in Image B is entirely stylized with no attempt to present realistic material properties. The finishes are matte but not realistic, adhering more to a comic aesthetic with heavy outlines and flat colors. Thus, realistic finishes are inherently not part of the simplified, cartoonish artistic expression presented in the edited image.",
