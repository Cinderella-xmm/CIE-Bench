      "question": "Is the capybara’s snout broad and flat with a rounded muzzle, consistent with its real-world anatomy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the details visible in the edited image, the capybara-like creature exhibits a broad and flat snout with a rounded muzzle, which is consistent with the typical anatomical structure of a real capybara. This can be identified by the shape and position of the snout as seen in the image. The edited image appears to maintain these features, ensuring that the representation is close to reality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the capybara’s ears small, rounded, and located high on the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the ears of the capybara-like character are small, rounded, and placed high on the head. This detail aligns with common characteristics of a real capybara's anatomy, as they generally have small and rounded ears positioned on the upper sides of their heads.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the capybara standing upright and facing directly toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts the capybara-like character standing upright and directly facing the viewer. This can be inferred from the orientation of the body and the position of the limbs, which suggest a frontal and upright posture, differing from the usual horizontal alignment of real capybaras.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the capybara-like character is shown with both hands in front of the chest, appearing to grip an object (a cup), indicating a position and action that are consistent with the description provided.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the capybara’s fur primarily light brown with darker tones around the muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fur of the character in the edited image appears to be primarily light brown with slightly darker shades noticeable around the muzzle area. This distribution of color aligns with a typical capybara's fur pattern, which often exhibits such tone variations.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the capybara have a stocky, large body with short legs and a thick torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, despite the cartoon-like modification, the capybara-like character maintains a stocky body with the implication of a large, thick torso and, based on the position and size of the limbs, short legs. This representation corresponds with the natural physique of real capybaras.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the capybara have four limbs visible or implied by posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, while only two limbs are explicitly visible due to the front-facing posture, the presence and posture imply the existence of four limbs typical for a quadrupedal creature like a capybara. Such implication aligns with the natural anatomy of capybaras.",
