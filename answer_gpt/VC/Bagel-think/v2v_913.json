      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the cake retain its two distinct layers of dark chocolate sponge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited cake depiction visually maintains the presence of two distinct layers of dark chocolate sponge. This is illustrated by the contrasting shade between the chocolate cream layer and the sponge layers, which is typical for a layered cake in animated and illustrated forms.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the top of the cake covered in a glossy, reflective chocolate glaze?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited cake still has a top that appears to be covered with a glossy chocolate glaze. This is indicated by the smoother, shinier texture and slight reflections visible in the illustration, suggesting a glossy finish similar to that of an actual chocolate glaze.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there three visible streams of chocolate glaze dripping down the front face of the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration includes three streams of chocolate glaze dripping down the front face of the cake, which is a direct translation of the drip from the real to the animated version.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the cake layers exhibit a dark brown, moist, and porous sponge texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the illustrated cake layers are depicted with a dark brown color typically associated with chocolate cakes, and the texture is suggested to be porous, which aligns with the moist sponge texture as seen in typical cake depictions within animated illustrations.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both the real and edited versions of the cake in Image B indicate that the cake is placed on a white circular plate. This detail from reality is retained and recreated in an animated context to maintain the cake's presentation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake is depicted in a cube shape in the animated story format, diverging from the triangular cross-sectional shape typically seen in a slice of cake.",
