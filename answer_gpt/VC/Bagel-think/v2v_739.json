    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes almond-shaped with a downward gaze, maintaining their original proportion and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show that the face area is blurred, making it impossible to discern eye shape, gaze, or orientation. Therefore, it's not possible to confirm the details of the eye shape or positioning.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the nose present with a visible bridge and tip, positioned centrally between the eyes and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a blurred face, preventing any observation of the nose, its bridge, tip, or position relative to the eyes and mouth.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the mouth have a subtle upward curve at the corners, forming a gentle smile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurred face in Image B does not allow the evaluation of mouth shape or expression, making it impossible to determine if the mouth has a smile or any specific contour.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the subject seated cross-legged with knees bent and body leaning forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi keychain figure is depicted as kneeling with the body leaning slightly forward, contrasting the typical cross-legged sitting position. Use of world knowledge about typical posture along with observation of the depicted position leads to this conclusion.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a small gold stud earring visible in the left ear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an object resembling a hanging gold decorative piece and a larger gold ornament near the ear. This is more intricate compared to a simple stud earring, thus the portrayal doesn't match with just a small gold stud earring.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the skin tone light to medium with natural undertones, consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visible hands in Image B resemble a lighter tone, and although the chibi design simplifies details like undertones, variations in lighting and artistic rendering may apply. Therefore, without direct comparison to Image A and considering factors like graphical style, it suggests a difference from the original.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the head tilted downward with the gaze directed forward and slightly down?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the blurred face in Image B, the angle of the head and position indicate a downward tilt in alignment with typical posture knowledge, where the gaze may be directed toward the phone.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
