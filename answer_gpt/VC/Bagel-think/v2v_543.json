    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the characters still depicted as actively skiing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows characters with small, chibi-like proportions suggesting animated or stylized forms. These characters hold ski poles and wear skis. Although the figures appear stationary due to their positioning and style, the presence of ski poles and skis traditionally associated with skiing activities signals that they represent active skiing.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the characters still arranged in a line formation while skiing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of characters shows a more spread out positioning, lacking the distinct linear formation seen in traditional skiing setups. The characters, particularly the chibi objects layered in front, disrupt the visual cues of linear formation and thus indicate a divergence from a strict line.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the characters still hold ski poles and wear skis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates the presence of ski poles held by characters and skis positioned beneath their feet, maintaining the sporting equipment necessary for skiing activities. This equipment is clearly visible and retains its identifying function.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there still a visible snowy path beneath the characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scene presented in Image B shows a snowy landscape beneath the characters with paths visible. The snow on the ground is prominent, and similar to traditional ski settings, it evinces a continuing presence of a snowy path.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the characters still moving forward along the path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the positions of skis and poles indicate readiness for movement, the stationary appearance of the chibi figures combined with their stylized form suggests limited or paused movement. Additionally, the environment background emphasizes festivity over functional progression.",
