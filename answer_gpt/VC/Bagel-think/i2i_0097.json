      "question": "Does the plate retain its circular shape and raised rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object being evaluated is a logo rather than a plate with a spoon. The logo has a circular shape which could be analogous to a plate. However, the elements and context do not include any raised rim typical of a physical plate. When considering the original context of a plate, this logo does not emulate the features of a rimmed plate.",

      "question": "Is the plate still white in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B represents a logo and not a literal plate. The logo's primary background is white, which can be loosely analogized to the plate's color in Image A, although this is not a depiction of a plate as in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the spoon retain its metallic finish and reflective surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no spoon present. The logo replaces the spoon and plate image entirely with text and graphic elements. Therefore, the characteristic metallic finish and reflective qualities of a spoon are no longer applicable.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the spoon still oriented vertically on the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no spoon present within the context of a plate. The image has been replaced with a logo, which features text and other graphic elements. Thus, there is no vertical spoon orientation in this context.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the plate and spoon still centrally positioned in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plate and spoon are no longer part of the composition. The image is a brand logo, and the elements of a plate and spoon have been entirely replaced by different visual elements. Therefore, there is nothing related to a plate and spoon to be centrally positioned.",
