      "question": "Is the glass bulb shaped like a teardrop with visible internal filaments present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear representation of a light bulb in the comic-style panel. The bulb is depicted as elongated and narrow, resembling the shape of a teardrop, and internal filaments are illustrated within it. The presence of these filaments is emphasized by visual cues such as lines inside the bulb, mimicking realistic filaments. The use of common cartoon illustration techniques helps in emphasizing these features, therefore the glass bulb does fit the description given in the question.",

      "question": "Are the curved vertical bars forming a cage-like structure around the bulb present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B visually depicts the lamp with curved vertical bars encasing the bulb. These bars are illustrated to resemble a cage that encloses the bulb, creating a protective and aesthetic structure typical of industrial or vintage lighting fixtures. This kind of design is aligned with a common style for light fixtures that use metal bars to create a cage-like pattern around bulbs. The visual cues make it evident that such bars are part of the design in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the dark cylindrical housing at the top of the fixture with a visible screw detail present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dark cylindrical housing at the lamp's top is distinctly illustrated. Typically, such housings provide support and are a part of the bulb's holder in lighting fixtures. A visible screw detail on the housing is a common design element used for securing the casing. The inclusion of these details in the comic style reflects the original design's functionality and aesthetic. Therefore, both the housing and screw detail are present in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the circular cap at the bottom of the metal cage present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the comic style representation shows the base of the cage, but lacks a clear circular cap at the bottom of these metal bars. Generally, a circular cap serves to anchor the bars and adds stability to the cage, but the illustration simplifies this region, omitting the cap detail that would be present in more realistic or detailed renderings. Hence, based on visual cues, the circular cap is not illustrated at the bottom of the cage in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the glass bulb positioned centrally within the metal cage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the bulb inside the metal cage in a comic fashion. The positioning of the bulb within the cage seems symmetrical and balanced, which visually suggests that the bulb is situated centrally. Such central positioning is standard for ensuring uniform distribution of light and stability within industrial-style fixtures. The depiction aligns with typical designs of bulbs within enclosed cages, thus confirming the bulb's central position within the structure.",
