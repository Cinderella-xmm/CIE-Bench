      "question": "Is the metallic mask with horn-like protrusions at the temples present and retaining its original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible metallic mask with horn-like protrusions at the temples. The image has been edited in a way that represents a cartoonish or illustrated style, which generally does not include textured or metallic elements. By contrast, Image A features elements that could resemble metallic surfaces, making this distinction clear upon analysis.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red lips and visible lower face (including chin and jawline) clearly present and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Ignoring the blurred face, in Image B, the area below the blurred section shows a simplified illustration style with no detailed human features like red lips, chin, or jawline. The original human-like characteristics are not represented in the edited image. Comparatively, Image A shows defined red lips and visible facial features, confirming changes in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the black hair styled in an updo with floral branches positioned symmetrically on both sides of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration preserves the positioning of the black hair styled in an updo. The floral branches are visibly and symmetrically integrated on both sides, mirroring the original style shown in Image A, which also has these elements. The consistency between the two images regarding hair styling and floral arrangement supports the conclusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are cherry blossom branches visibly integrated into the hair on both sides of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features branches resembling cherry blossoms integrated into the hair symmetrically. These branches are visually present and mirror the floral arrangement seen in Image A. The visual representation of cherry blossoms in an illustrative style matches the composition from the original image.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the subjectâ€™s facial skin tone fair and uniformly lit, matching the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blurred face does not allow for assessment of skin tone but areas beneath blur appear uniform. Image A demonstrates a fair and uniformly lit skin tone, which is typical in high-quality portraits. The non-visibility in B and comparison with A confirm there is no match.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Ignoring the blurred face, Image B shows the subject with a forward-facing, symmetrical pose, and centered composition. The vertical alignment with the visible elements like hair and floral branches is consistent with Image A, confirming the pose is unchanged in perspective.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the mask retain a textured, metallic surface appearance rather than becoming smooth or cartoonish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the masking effect over the face contributes to a smooth and cartoonish look rather than textured or metallic. Upon analysis, Image A might exhibit texture consistent with metallic surfaces, which is not maintained in the edited version, indicating a shift in representation style.",
