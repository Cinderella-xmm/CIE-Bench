      "question": "Is the kayak still bright yellow in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kayak is part of a photo held in someone's hand. It maintains its bright yellow color, similar to Image A. By recognizing the color cues and combining this with common knowledge that object's colors persist unless altered, the kayak still appears bright yellow.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the black bungee cords in an X-pattern present on both ends of the kayak deck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the featured kayak within the handheld photo has a black bungee cord in an X-pattern visible at the top of the kayak deck. This matches the structure seen on Image A, where these cords are present. By examining structural details and using logical recognition of patterns, it is seen that the cords maintain their presence.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, the kayak within the photo still displays a black padded seat inside, as it is a distinctive feature easily identifiable in both images. Recognizing familiar details such as seating helps confirm its continuance after editing.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skateboard in the handheld photo in Image B retains its dark gray grip tape on its surface. This suggests consistency, as the grip tape’s color remains unchanged from Image A, assisted by common knowledge that standard skateboards have grip tape of such color, which aids in traction.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, inspecting the toy model skateboard within the photo reveals silver trucks and tan wheels remain consistent with Image A. Analyzing color features and matching them with knowledge of skateboard components supports this continuity.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that within the photo, both objects—the kayak and the skateboard—retain their vertical alignment and parallel placement, as initially arranged in Image A. Logical spatial awareness and object comparison affirm they remain unchanged in positioning.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's background within the handheld photo portrays a uniform neutral beige surface, akin to Image A. Observational skills and differentiation between shades confirm that the neutral beige background remains consistent.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, as displayed in the handheld photo, both the kayak and skateboard throw soft shadows to the left, indicating light source direction, consistent with what is seen in Image A. Shadow placement provides visual depth and contextual alignment in assessment.",
