    {

      "question": "Is the clock frame still circular in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock's outline is discernible as circular, based on observing the symmetry and consistent round edges typical of a circular shape. This aligns with world knowledge where clocks frequently feature circular frames for aesthetic and functional reasons.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the proportions of the clock hands and line markers remain consistent with the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock hands appear stubby and larger relative to the clock face compared to Image A. The line markers also appear slightly different in size. These observations indicate a change in proportion and design style from the original clock. Both elements do not share the same slender proportions seen in Image A's traditional clock style, which typically allows clean readability.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the clock face still white with black line markers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the clock face appears metallic with a brushed texture rather than white. The line markers are visibly raised and metallic, and they are not black. These visual differences are notable when compared to the Image A clock style frequently associated with minimalistic design, which typically features a white face with sharp black markers for contrast.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there still no numerals on the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, as in Image A, the clock face does not contain numerals, maintaining the design choice for simplicity and minimalism. This reflects a modern design choice seen in many contemporary clocks, where line markers often substitute numerals for stylistic or streamlined purposes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the clock hands and markers positioned relatively the same as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock hands and markers in Image B continue to be positioned to depict a similar time as in Image A, around 10:10. Despite variations in design elements and proportions, their relative positions show consistency with the standard practice of illustrative clock design to maintain readability or decor principles.",
