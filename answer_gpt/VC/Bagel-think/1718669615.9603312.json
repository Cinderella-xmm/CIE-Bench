      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the presence of two parallel railway tracks extending into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the visual representation shows what appears to be two tracks created in an abstract, artistic style that mimic the pattern of parallel lines extending into the distance. However, due to the nature of the artwork, the tracks may not clearly be two distinct parallel lines as in realistic imagery but suggest their presence.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the railway track visibly curved to the right as it recedes into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, observing the railway track pattern, due to the highly stylized depiction, there is a suggestion of curvature to the right as the tracks extend into the distance. The flowing lines suggest movement to the right, consistent with curvature.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the UFO positioned directly above the central axis of the railway track?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the UFO appears abstractly crafted with swirling patterns above what represents the railway tracks. The center of the UFO seems aligned with the central flow of the tracks' pattern, indicating a position above the central axis.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a clear horizontal line separating the sky from the land in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the sky and land is abstract and highly stylized, making it challenging to discern any clear horizontal line. Hence, the separation between sky and land is more gradient and unclear rather than a distinct horizontal division.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the railway track visibly elevated above the surrounding ground level?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the representation is abstract without realistic elevation indications. The lines of the tracks and patterns do not explicitly indicate elevation relative to ground level, as they blend into an artistic depiction.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the railway tracks converge toward a single point on the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the abstracted pattern does suggest some form of convergence as the lines appear to narrow toward the distant part of the image, suggesting a vanishing point or convergence, consistent with a perspective where lines appear to meet at the horizon.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
