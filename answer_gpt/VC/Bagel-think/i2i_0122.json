      "question": "Are the glass cups transparent and maintain their cylindrical shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass cups are clearly visible and transparent, allowing the beverage inside to be seen. The cups have a consistent cylindrical shape, with smooth sides and a flat top. These are typical characteristics of glass cups, made to showcase the beverage they hold while retaining their form. The visual cues in Image B confirm the transparency and cylindrical nature of the cups by showing clarity in the material and uniformity in shape.",

      "question": "Does the beverage inside the cups retain its brown color and smooth texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beverage inside the cups clearly maintains a rich brown color, consistent with drinks like coffee or tea. The surface of the liquid exhibits a smooth texture without any visible disturbances or particulates. This is often expected in a freshly poured or heated liquid, where the texture appears uniform, reinforcing the idea of a well-prepared hot drink. These observations in Image B confirm the retention of both color and texture.",

      "question": "Is the steam visibly rising above the cups in a natural manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals steam rising from the cups in delicate, wispy curls. The way the steam ascends is consistent with natural evaporation from heated liquid, where it typically rises and disperses in the air. This visual effect is common in hot beverages and demonstrates the presence of heat, suggesting the liquid is fresh and hot. The natural movement and behavior of the steam above the cups in Image B confirm this analysis.",

      "question": "Do the cups sit firmly on the wooden surface, showing their shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cups are positioned steadily on the wooden tabletop, and their presence casts defined shadows on the surface below. This alignment and shadow formation indicate a stable placement, as is expected when cups are properly set on a flat surface. The interaction between light and the solidity of the cups results in the casting of shadows, reinforcing the perception of their firm placement on the table in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the image retain a warm tone, highlighted by the steam and beverages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a visual scene dominated by warm tones, evident in the color of the beverage and the steam's interaction with lighting. This warmth is further accentuated by the ambiance of the surrounding environment, typical of themes associated with comfort or coziness. The visual details, such as the warm lighting on the snow-covered cabin and the glow from illuminating sources, complement the overall warmth theme. These elements in Image B confirm the retention of a warm tone.",
