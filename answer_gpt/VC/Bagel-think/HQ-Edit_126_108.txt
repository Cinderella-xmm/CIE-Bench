    "Question": "Q7: Is there visible mist rising from the base of the waterfall and diffusing into the air?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is clear visibility of mist rising from the base of the waterfall. This mist diffusing into the air adds motion and atmosphere to the scene. The depiction of mist is consistent with a waterfall's natural process, where the impact of water generates vapor, visible against the light that passes through.",
