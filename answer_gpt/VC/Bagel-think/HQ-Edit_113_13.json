      "question": "Does the fox retain its characteristic orange fur on the back and sides, white fur on the chest and muzzle, and black fur on the lower legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fox is depicted in a stylized, cartoon-like manner. It has an orange fur coat on the back and sides, with a white chest and muzzle, and black lower legs, maintaining the typical color pattern seen in real-life foxes. This characteristic is exemplified in many cartoon representations of foxes as it highlights the distinct and familiar color pattern of a real fox.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the fox’s tail bushy and curled, ending in a clearly visible white tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fox character has a bushy and curled tail. Given the stylized nature of the depiction, the tail's curl is prominent and ends in a white tip. Cartoon representations often exaggerate these features for emphasis.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there two monarch butterflies with orange and black wings hovering near the fox’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no monarch butterflies depicted. The image is a cartoon scene focused on the fox character speaking to a group of other small animals, without any presence of butterflies in the immediate surroundings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting is a simplified outdoor scene with minimal details. There are no specific plants like small white daisies with yellow centers visible, as the focus is primarily on the characters rather than the vegetation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground is depicted in a flat and stylized manner typical of cartoons, without detailed textures like moss. The environment is simplified for clarity and focuses more on color and shapes than on textural details, which is characteristic of cartoon art.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a bright light source behind the trees, creating a glowing effect and casting rays through the forest canopy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the simplistic and cartoonish design does not include background elements like a forest canopy or a bright light source creating rays, which would require a more realistic environment. The background is minimalistic, focusing mainly on the interactions between the fox and the other characters.",
