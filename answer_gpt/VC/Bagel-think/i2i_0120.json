      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Bulbasaur figurine is a character representation with predominantly green skin, which is a trademark feature of this Pokémon character. Darker green geometric shapes appear across its body, resembling diamonds or triangular forms. This is consistent with the stylized design choices for Bulbasaur across its media presence.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The claws on the Bulbasaur figurine's feet in Image B are noted as having a triangular shape, which is characteristic of the original Bulbasaur design.

In Image A, the claws also follow this design language, supporting the observation that the edited image reflects the same triangular design.",
