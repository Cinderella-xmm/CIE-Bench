    "Question": "Q1: Is the woman’s facial profile, including the shape of her nose, jaw, and eyes, preserved in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's facial features are not visible due to the editing style mimicking a LEGO figure. LEGO figures have a simplistic and stylized form, lacking detailed anatomical features such as a nose, jaw, or eyes. This is consistent with the typical design of such figures. Therefore, the facial profile is not preserved in the edited image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the woman’s hair light brown in color and styled in a braid?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hair of the figure is rendered in the style of a LEGO piece, which is typically blocky and lacks fine details like individual strands or braids. The color seems to be consistent with a brown hue. However, due to the blocky design, it is not styled in a braid as recognizable human hairstyles are not typically depicted in LEGO figures.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the shirt and vest rendered in the original beige and olive-green colors, respectively?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt and vest are depicted using LEGO block colors. The shirt appears to have a beige-like appearance, and the vest seems to be represented in a dark color, possibly aiming to depict olive-green. While the LEGO version captures the essence of the colors, the exact shades and textures may not exactly match the original image due to the limitations of LEGO colors.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the woman’s hands positioned on a control mechanism in the same way as in the original image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO figure's hands are gripping a mechanism similar to the way the original woman's hands are holding onto controls. The LEGO representation mimics this positioning using typical LEGO hand pieces which are structured to hold rods or tools. Thus, the hand position is consistent with the original image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the straps and buckles of the tactical vest visibly present and structurally intact?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the vest is represented using LEGO pieces, with details such as straps and buckles being abstracted into simpler forms. While the vest is designed to suggest straps and structure, the exact features like detailed buckles and straps are not clearly visible due to the stylized LEGO design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the woman’s skin tone and facial expression (calm, focused) preserved?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO figure does not have human facial features, including expressions. Skin tone is typically represented by a uniform color in LEGO figures, lacking variation. Facial expressions are usually non-existent or minimal due to the simplicity of LEGO designs. Consequently, neither the skin tone nuances nor facial expression is preserved.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the woman have blue-gray eyes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the facial areas where eyes would be are not detailed, in line with typical LEGO figure design, which often lacks such features unless explicitly painted on. Hence, there are no discernible eyes or indication of blue-gray color.",
    "answer": "No"
