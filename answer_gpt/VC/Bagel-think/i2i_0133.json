        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both bears possess a clearly round and fluffy body shape, which is commonly associated with a cute and cartoonish design for bears. The roundness of their shape is exaggerated, typical of many animated or illustrative depictions to emphasize cuddliness and appeal. No significant change to their body form is observed when comparing to Image A.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows both bears seated closely to each other, maintaining a pose that suggests companionship.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a clear sky with soft, fluffy clouds, presenting a serene and peaceful background typical of cartoon settings.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes small flowers scattered on the grass, notably white daisies with orange centers. This detail indicates that the aesthetic of having flowers add to the idyllic, natural setting.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows clearly defined paw pads on the bears' feet, characterized by their stark contrast to the surrounding fur and cuteness appeal in illustration design. Comparing to Image A, the paw pads remain maintained and visible, thus preserving a characteristic feature commonly used in such depictions.",
