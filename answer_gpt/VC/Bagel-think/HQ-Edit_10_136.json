      "question": "Is the acoustic guitar present with a visible sound hole and fretboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon examining the details, the instrument is depicted with features typical of an acoustic guitar, such as a visible sound hole and strings across a fretboard. The visual style, while more illustrative, maintains these identifiable traits, allowing us to conclude the presence of an acoustic guitar. In Image A, the guitar also displays these characteristics, confirming consistency in both images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl is depicted sitting cross-legged on what appears to be a fluffy white cushion, consistent with an artistic illustration style. This depiction matches with common portrayals of comfort and casual seating. A similar pose on a fluffy surface is evident in Image A as well, confirming continuity in this description.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows colorful squares with unrecognizable words on the wall, diverging significantly from specific text labels. These design elements differ from the detailed posters and clear words visible in Image A, where names like 'GERLESIES' are part of the decor. The disparity in Image B suggests absence of such specific text.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a window is framed by sheer curtains of a light peach hue, letting in ample daylight. This is visually similar to Image A, where the window and its curtains allow bright light into the room, confirming a consistent portrayal across both images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a small, round table is depicted with a container that resembles a bottle, though the contents are not clearly orange, nor is a pencil visible. This contrasts with Image A, where the table distinctly shows a bottle of orange liquid and a pencil. The difference in Image B indicates a lack of these specific items.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floor is represented with a wood-like appearance, upon which sits an off-white, fluffy item where the girl sits, akin to a small rug. Image A also has a wooden floor with a similar rug-like object under her, suggesting the portrayal of a singular fluffy item rather than a full rug covering.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a bed with white bedding is illustrated next to the girl, accompanied by what seems to be a simplistic pillow design rather than one with floral patterns. Compared to Image A, where a floral-patterned pillow is evident, the discrepancy suggests its absence in Image B.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The attire in Image B consists of a top resembling a t-shirt and wider leg pants, which are illustrated in a light-colored shirt, distinct from light blue, with blue jeans clearly visible.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a notable presence of a necklace with a small pendant at the center, illustrated in a style that can be interpreted as silver. This piece of jewelry is consistent with the silver pendant necklace the girl wears in Image A, maintaining this accessory's depiction.",
