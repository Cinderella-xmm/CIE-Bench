    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the curved, tapering silhouette of the central golden skyscraper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, on the bookmark, the central golden skyscraper represented has a curved, tapering silhouette that resembles the original tower's design from Image A. The edited bookmark features a keychain that artistically suggests this shape, maintaining the visual concept of curvature and tapering seen on the central skyscraper in Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the sharp, asymmetrical top of the leftmost skyscraper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookmark representing the leftmost skyscraper has retained its sharp, asymmetrical top, following the distinct design seen in Image A. The asymmetrical top is a distinctive feature of the building, and this is mirrored in the stylized keychain bookmark design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the stepped, rectangular form of the building next to the central tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookmark does not showcase the stepped, rectangular form of the building next to the central tower as seen in Image A. The edited version simplifies the design, without retaining the stepped levels typically found on the building's silhouette.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the vertical light strip pattern on the right-side skyscraper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookmark design does not retain the vertical light strip pattern of the right-side skyscraper as originally observed in Image A. The bookmark is represented in a stylized manner that misses the subtle, vertical light strip pattern, focusing more on general silhouette than specific detailing.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the bookmark preserve the height-to-width ratio and tapering proportion of the central skyscraper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookmark represents an artistic version of the central skyscraper, but does not precisely preserve the height-to-width ratio and tapering proportion seen in Image A. The edited bookmark is more stylized and simplified, and as such, these specific proportions appear adjusted or exaggerated.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the wider base of the central skyscraper compared to its upper section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B conveys a stylized bookmark of the central skyscraper which does not emphasize or clearly retain the wider base of the actual skyscraper compared to its upper section. The stylization process leads to simplification, possibly flattening or equalizing these proportions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the red buoy present in the final image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no representation of the red buoy that is clearly seen in the original Image A. The focus in the edited version is on the artistic representation of skyscrapers as bookmarks; hence, such details in the water like the buoy are omitted.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
