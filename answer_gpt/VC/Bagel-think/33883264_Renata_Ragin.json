      "question": "Are the pointed Gothic arches clearly visible within the stone towers of the bridge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the region corresponding to the stone towers of the bridge appears distorted or obscured by some editing effect, making the previously sharp Gothic arches less distinct. Gothic arches are known for their pointed shape and clear definition. However, in this edited image, the features are not clearly identifiable, indicating that they are not clearly visible. In Image A, the arches are clear and distinct, showing typical features of Gothic architecture.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the American flag still present on top of the left tower of the bridge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the distortion observed on the bridge tower, the American flag remains visible at the top of the left tower. The flag is small but discernible due to its placement and coloring, which helps it stand out against the sky.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the bridge tower retain its original light gray sandstone texture with visible block patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture of the bridge towers is not consistent with the common light gray sandstone with block patterns seen in historical structures. The towers appear altered with a different texture, making the original block patterns and typical sandstone coloring unclear. In Image A, the towers display these features clearly, showing the inherent texture of the masonry.",
      "weight": 3,

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the Freedom Tower positioned behind and slightly to the right of the bridge’s central axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Freedom Tower is visible behind the bridge and positioned slightly to the right of the bridge’s central axis. The perspective and alignment of buildings have not changed significantly between the two images. In Image A as well, the Freedom Tower occupies the same relative position.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a reflective surface of water directly beneath the bridge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower portion of the image reveals a reflective surface beneath the bridge, indicative of water. The reflections and textures are consistent with a body of water typically found beneath city bridges. Image A also confirms this with clear visuals of water.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the clouds in the sky distributed in a partly cloudy pattern with soft blue and white tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a sky with a partly cloudy pattern, consisting of varied cloud formations spread against a backdrop of soft blue tones. In Image A, this same visual characteristic of sky distribution in color and cloud patterning is present. Both images show consistency in this atmospheric detail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the surrounding skyscrapers retain visible grid patterns of windows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, skyscrapers in the background still maintain visible grid patterns of windows typical of high-rise buildings, which are designed to maximize light and structural aesthetics. The visibility of these patterns is consistent with those seen in Image A, confirming that the window patterns have remained unchanged in their clarity and arrangement.",
