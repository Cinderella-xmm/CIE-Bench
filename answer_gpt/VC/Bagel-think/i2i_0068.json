      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seated person appears to be holding the cake with both hands.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the standing person is captured in the act of placing or throwing a gray object over the seated person's head.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the candles on the cake emit a strong, bright light, indicating that they are lit. Comparing with Image A, both images show lit candles, but in Image B, the glow appears more pronounced due to enhanced brightness in the image processing.",

Compared to Image A, the lighting is noticeably brighter in Image B, but the overall layout suggests it is distributed evenly across the space.",
