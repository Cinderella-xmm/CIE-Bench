      "question": "Does the locomotive retain its green color and the \"ROVES 1621\" label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the locomotive is still visibly green with the label 'ROVES 1621' clearly seen on the front. The visual cues confirm the preservation of the locomotive's characteristics from Image A. Common knowledge of such vintage locomotives supports the inference that their labeling and primary colors remain unchanged in slight edits unless directly altered.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the train still positioned on the tracks and heading towards the observer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train is clearly positioned on the tracks and oriented in the direction of the camera. This is determined by the perspective showing the front of the locomotive, indicating its movement towards the observer. Such a setup is consistent with the original setup in Image A, which also showed the train moving towards the observer.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the reddish-brown vintage-style passenger cars still attached to the locomotive?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the passenger cars connected to the locomotive appear to be of a reddish-brown hue and vintage style. The visual continuity of their appearance from Image A is maintained, as there are no indication of changes to these elements in the edit.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there still a group of people standing on the platform near the train?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a crowd is present alongside the platform. Despite any modifications, it is visually consistent with the original scene where the platform was occupied by observers. The layout and behavior of people parallel expected scenarios in vintage train scenes where spectators gather.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the lighting conditions and shadows still indicate late afternoon or early evening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadows retain the warm hues and angles typical of late afternoon or early evening, likely sourced from the sun's low position in the sky. This remains consistent with Image A, where similar lighting conditions were present. Such lighting often enhances the nostalgic feel of scenes involving vintage figures and machinery.",
