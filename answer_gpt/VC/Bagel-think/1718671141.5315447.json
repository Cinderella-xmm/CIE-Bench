      "question": "Is there a raised platform beneath the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure is built on what appears to be a raised platform as there is a distinction between the foundation of the building and the surrounding water surface. The water does not directly meet the building's base as it appears elevated, allowing for reflection and separation. Such architectural designs often involve a base or platform to enhance the visual stance of the structure. Therefore, there is a raised platform present.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a still water surface directly in front of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a water surface can be seen in front and below the structure, offering a mirror-like reflection of the building. The smooth and clear reflection indicates that this water surface is still, without any notable disturbance such as waves. This suggests the presence of a tranquil water body in front.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the building have multiple horizontal tiers stacked vertically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The structure in Image B showcases multiple circular clock faces and related components but does not have clearly defined horizontal tiers. Rather, it presents a singular cohesive unit with interconnected elements, unlike a tiered construction where layers are stacked distinctly.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the building positioned centrally above the water pool on a raised platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building is strategically centered above the water pool. The platform beneath it elevates the structure above the water. This design indicates central placement which offers a symmetric reflection on the water surface. Thus, the building is centralized above the water on a platform.",

      "question": "Is the sky dark blue with scattered stars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky exhibits a dark blue hue, typical of nighttime or early dusk, with bright scattered stars dotting the expanse. This setting is characteristic of tranquility and evokes a clear night sky often found in cinematic or picturesque landscapes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there trees arranged symmetrically on both sides of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scene in Image B shows trees positioned on either side of the building. While they do not mirror each other exactly due to variations in foliage and space, they are still placed in a balanced manner relative to the building's central position, indicative of symmetric layout in landscaping.",
