    "Question": "Q1: Are the black-framed glasses with rectangular lenses and visible reflections on the lenses still present on the man's face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the man's face is obscured due to editing, but from the visible parts, there are no signs or indications of black-framed glasses present. The size of the blur suggests that any such glasses would not be hidden unless they were also edited out. Therefore, it's logical to conclude that glasses are not present.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the trimmed beard and mustache, particularly the defined jawline coverage and upper lip growth, still present on the man's face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the man's face is entirely blurred, making it impossible to determine any facial hair characteristics such as a beard or mustache. Since nothing else suggests their presence, they should be considered absent in this context.",

}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the light brown, textured, swept-back hairstyle with visible volume and side-parting still present on the man's head?",

    "Question": "Q4: Are both hands positioned near the writing object (book), with the right hand showing a grip-like pose and the left hand partially extended toward the object?",
