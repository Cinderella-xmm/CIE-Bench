    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the facial structure including the eyes, nose, beard, and smile preserved exactly as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial structure has been blurred, making it impossible to determine if these features are preserved as they are not visible. Typically, when an image's face is blurred, specific features of the face are obscured or removed. Therefore, it cannot be preserved exactly as in the original image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial region where the floral henna designs would be is blurred, making it impossible to see whether these designs are present or unchanged. Generally, blurring removes visibility of details.",

    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the earrings are visible in both ears. The earrings are still visible compared to normal surrounding blurriness, meaning that they are not obscured and can be identified clearly.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face is blurred, obscuring the ability to determine the direction of the gaze. Therefore, from the blurred content provided, it is impossible to judge the direction of the subject's gaze.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The natural skin tone and texture are not preserved in Image B as the facial area is covered with a blur effect, making it impossible to see details related to skin texture and tone.",
