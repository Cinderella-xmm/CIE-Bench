      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is Joseph depicted holding a lantern in his right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure that can be identified as Joseph does not appear to be holding any object resembling a lantern in his right hand. He is simply depicted as a figure, without specific details like a lantern. Therefore, using common visual understanding, Joseph is not holding a lantern.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is Mary shown kneeling with both hands clasped in front of her chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are three main figures, but none of them show the detailed pose of kneeling with hands clasped, which is often an expression of prayer or devotion. The figures have a more rigid and stylized posture, typical of porcelain or ceramic nativity sets.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the infant Jesus lying in a manger with a halo composed of radiating lines around his head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the infant Jesus is depicted lying in a manger, and there is a stylized halo composed of radiating lines around his head, which is a common iconographic feature to signify holiness in religious art.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are a donkey and a sheep present in the scene, positioned near the manger?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are figures of animals near the main figures, but these appear to be more stylized and are not clearly identifiable as a donkey and a sheep specifically. The animals in this scene could represent varied creatures typically found in nativity scenes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a five-pointed star positioned at the apex of the roof structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible structure resembling a roof or a five-pointed star positioned at any apex. The setting is more of a decorative display without a stable's roof-like structure.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a stylized palm tree located to the left side of the stable structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement does not include any elements like palm trees or stable structures typically represented in nativity scenes. The focus is more on the figures themselves.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there circular halos present around the heads of Joseph, Mary, and Jesus?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures, including those representing Joseph and Mary, do not have circular halos present. The representation is more abstract and modern, focusing on form rather than traditional symbolism.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the infant Jesus is positioned on a manger-like object, but there is no roof present in the scene. The arrangement is more like a display piece rather than a traditional stable setting.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Is Joseph positioned on the left side of the stable, Mary on the right, and Jesus in the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures' arrangement does not clearly follow the specified positions of left for Joseph, right for Mary, and center for Jesus. The figures are grouped closely together without a rigid spatial hierarchy, which is often seen in modern or abstract nativity displays.",
