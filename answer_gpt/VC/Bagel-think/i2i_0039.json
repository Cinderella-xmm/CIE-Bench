      "question": "Is the adult polar bear positioned behind the two cubs, with the cubs visibly interacting with each other?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon analyzing the placement and posture of the polar bears, the adult polar bear is seen standing or positioned behind the two cubs. The two cubs appear to be close to each other, suggesting interaction or grouping, which is typical behavior for cubs. This setup is clearly visible in Image B, so the positioning aligns with the description provided in the question.",

      "question": "Are the detailed textures of the ice and snow, including ridges and smooth patches, still present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, various textures can still be noticed on the ice and snow where the polar bears are situated. These details include visible ridges and smoother areas that are indicative of typical snow and ice surfaces. This attention to detail in texture remains consistent with what one would expect in this type of natural scene.",

      "question": "Is the ocean backdrop visible behind the ice floe, showing the dark blue water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the backdrop of the ocean at the top of the image, indicating dark blue water behind the ice floe where the polar bears are located. The presence of this water is consistent with a polar environment, which features open water and ice.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadows on both the polar bears and the ice appear to be realistically maintained. This is noticeable through the subtle shadows and highlights that give dimension to the bears and the contours of the ice, signifying the preservation of natural light effects.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The polar bears in Image B maintain their natural white fur color, which characterizes their iconic look. There is no indication in the colors or patterns of their fur that suggests any significant alteration, allowing them to appear as one would expect for polar bears.",
