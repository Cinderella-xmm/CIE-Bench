      "question": "Does the skateboard retain its vibrant design with the sun motif and wavy lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard is positioned above the subject's head and still features the same vibrant design as observed in Image A: the sun motif and wavy lines are visible. This suggests that the skateboard's design remains unchanged between the original and edited images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the subject still wearing a red cap, black shirt, and beige jacket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's attire appears consistent with the original image. The subject is still wearing a red cap, black shirt, and beige jacket, as these elements of clothing are not altered during the editing process.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard is clearly positioned above the subject's head in the same manner as in the original image. Its location relative to the subject has not changed during editing, suggesting consistency in positioning.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the subject retain their facial features and expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject's facial features and expressions are blurred in both Image A and Image B, making it impossible to confirm whether these aspects have been retained or altered in editing. Hence, without clear visual cues, the answer cannot address the retention of facial features and expression.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the subject maintain their confident stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image maintains the subject's general posture shown in the original image. The upright, relaxed stance suggests that their confident posture is consistent across both images. The positioning of the body and clothing supports this conclusion.",
