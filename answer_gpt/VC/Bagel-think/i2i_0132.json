      "question": "Is the frisbee visible in mid-air between the two individuals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the frisbee is depicted as a small, red, disc-shaped object that is positioned in the air between the two characters. This floating position typically indicates that the frisbee is in mid-air during a game of catch or throw. This observation is strongly supported by the context of the scene and the common layout of a frisbee flying between two people who are playing catch.",

      "question": "Does one individual have their arm extended forward, as if throwing the frisbee?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the individual on the right has their left arm slightly extended forward in a manner consistent with throwing or having just released a frisbee. The position of the arm is suggestive of the final motion in the throwing action. This conclusion is drawn from the posture and the context of an active game involving a frisbee in flight.",

      "question": "Does the other individual have both hands raised, prepared to catch the frisbee?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the individual on the left with both hands raised and positioned to the side, which is typical for someone preparing to catch a lightweight flying object like a frisbee. This posture indicates readiness to receive the approaching frisbee that is visible in the air between the players.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is illustrated with trees that are spaced out along the periphery, typical of a park or open field setting. The trees provide a natural backdrop, consistent with environments where outdoor activities such as playing frisbee occur.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both characters are depicted wearing attire that resembles casual clothing: white shirts and pants that resemble jeans. These items do not appear to be tailored for sporting purposes, which aligns with typical casual attire suitable for leisure activities such as playing frisbee in a park.",
