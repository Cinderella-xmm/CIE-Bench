      "question": "Is the bindi present on the dancer's forehead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's forehead and face details are blurred, making it challenging to ascertain minute details such as the presence of a bindi. Without concrete information from the image, it's reasonable to deduce, based on typical cultural adornments in classical dances, that it might be present but cannot be confirmed.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer has a hairstyle characteristic of traditional dance attire, which often includes elaborate headpieces and hair styling. However, the specific style visible in the image suggests more of an ornamental arrangement rather than dark braided hair itself.",

        "No"
      ],

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dancer's posture in Image B has both feet placed firmly on the ground, with no elevation or bent knee visible that suggests the right leg is elevated.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dancer in Image B does maintain a balanced and upright posture, but there is no indication of an elevated leg. The position of the arms and body does hint at traditional dance forms where the torso might twist slightly due to arm positioning rather than leg movement.",
