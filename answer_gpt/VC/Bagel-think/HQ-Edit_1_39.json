      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a wooden window frame with stone pillars visible on both sides. The structure appears consistent with a typical rectangular frame, as observed in the visual details, similar to common window frames. Using this analysis, it seems unchanged compared to standard architectural features.",

        "No"
      ],

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a shadow from the object positioned on the windowsill that is indeed casting shadows to the left, suggesting that the light source, presumably the sun, is on the right side. Observing shadows' directions can help locate the light source.",
