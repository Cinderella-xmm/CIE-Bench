        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the second boy is depicted with a full head of hair, shown with distinct brown hair. This differs from the typical depiction of baldness, which would involve no visible hair on the scalp.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, neither boy is depicted as holding a tablet upright with both hands.

The second boy has hair, and there is no indication of a tablet being held upright.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not have a tablet showing an indoor scene. The focus of the visual is on the interaction of the boys with their devices and colorful elements around them, rather than specific content being displayed on a tablet screen.",
