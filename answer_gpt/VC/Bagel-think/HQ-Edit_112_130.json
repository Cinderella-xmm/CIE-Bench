      "question": "Is the violin clearly present under the woman’s chin, held by her left hand, with the bow drawn across the strings by her right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is seen clearly holding the violin with her left hand while her chin rests upon it. Her right hand is holding the bow and positioned across the strings, indicating the action of playing. This is a typical posture for violin players, utilizing standard technique where the instrument is supported by the chin and held somewhat horizontally, allowing the bow to be drawn across the strings with the right hand.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both arms positioned correctly to support violin playing—left arm holding the instrument, right arm moving the bow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's left arm holds the violin in a typical violin playing posture while the right arm holds the bow. This configuration allows the violin to be held in place under the chin with the left hand stabilizing it, while the bow in the right hand moves across the strings to produce music. The position of the arms follows standard violin playing form.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the woman have her eyes closed and a calm, focused facial expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not provide any detailed view of the woman's eyes or expressions due to the blurred face. Therefore, assessing her facial expression or whether her eyes are closed is not possible just based on the visual cues available.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is positioned upright, which is typical for achieving balance while playing an instrument. Her body displays a slight angle towards the viewer, allowing for an engaging perspective with the viewer. This positioning often helps when demonstrating focus on the instrument.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bow is held by the woman’s right hand with its position allowing for contact with the strings of the violin. However, it's not explicitly in contact with the strings in the image, appearing slightly above them, thus making it unclear whether contact is occurring.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman has long hair flowing down her back and over her shoulders, contributing to the elegance and grandeur of the setting. However, the image depicts her hair as having a brownish hue rather than being distinctly dark.",
