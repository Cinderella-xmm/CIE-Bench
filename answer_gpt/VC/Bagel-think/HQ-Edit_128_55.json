      "question": "Is the golden spherical knocker still present and positioned at the center of the lower half of the door?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the center of the door where the golden spherical knocker was present in Image A is now replaced with a detailed sculpture of a winged owl-like figure. The structure diverges from the original design by incorporating ornate elements, but the golden spherical knocker is no longer visible. The assessment relies on visual observation and comparison between the item identified as a door knocker in Image A and the absence thereof in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the intricate geometric carvings visible on both door panels, especially in the upper and lower sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire door is replaced by a large, winged owl-like sculpture, eliminating all prior elements of the door itself, including any geometric carvings that existed in Image A. The change in design and structure replaces traditional woodworking details with a singular ornate sculpture, thus confirming the absence of original door carvings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a winged sculpture replacing all elements of Image A's door design, including the mentioned rows of black metal studs. Therefore, the original arrangement and structure of the door with its studded details are not present in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surrounding wall in Image B retains the earth-toned adobe design with visible cracks and peeling plaster, consistent with what appears in Image A. The wall itself has not been altered relative to the complex changes carried out on the door. Through visual analysis, the textural condition and color palette of the wall remains unchanged.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B feature a small square window with what appears to be a tile pattern to the right of the doorframe. This detail is not altered in the editing process, maintaining the alignment and placement of the window in the adobe wall across both images.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground remains consistent with Image A, showcasing rectangular paving stones arranged in a herringbone pattern. This aspect has not been altered in the edit, as seen through comparative visual analysis between both images, highlighting identical paving design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B keeps the same carved wooden surround with geometric borders and a flat lintel as seen in Image A. The door itself is replaced, but structural aspects of the frame remain consistent, sustaining the intricate design and geometry of the original door frame as visually identified. The continuous ornate embracement of the door via the frame affirms the lack of alteration there.",
