      "question": "Is the trunk of each elephant still curved upward in the same manner as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, both elephants appear to have their trunks curved upward. This is evidenced by the visible curve that closely resembles the traditional upward motion associated with decorative elephant figures. Without comparing yet, this allows for recognizing familiar artistic representations.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
