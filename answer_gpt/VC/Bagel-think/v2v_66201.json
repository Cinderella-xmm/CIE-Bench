      "question": "Is the monkey's face and expression clearly visible and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of Image B shows that the monkey's face is obscured by a blurred block, indicating that the face and expression are not visible or discernible due to this distortion. In Image B, the focus on the face seems deliberately altered, thus the expression or facial features cannot be assessed. Therefore, based on visual inspection, the answer is derived from the explicit presentation in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the background still feature a spiral galaxy with stars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background prominently features a spiral galaxy with stars, similar to Image A. The presence of the same cosmic elements indicates continuity in the background between the two images. The galaxy's glowing spiral and the surrounding stars are visually similar, suggesting that the background feature has been maintained.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the monkey's overall posture, including the upward extension of its tail, retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The posture of the monkey in Image B is similar to Image A, with the tail extending upward. Image B adds intricate designs and mechanical elements to the body but retains the core posture, including the direction and position of the tail, as observed in Image A. The visual cue of the tail position corroborates that the monkey's posture has been largely retained.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the brass scientific instrument still positioned on the wooden surface near the monkey?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the brass scientific instrument remains prominent on the wooden surface near the monkey. It appears to be unchanged in design and placement when compared with Image A, maintaining its position alongside the monkey. Therefore, based on continuity and visual cues, the positioning has been preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wooden surface beneath the brass instrument still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden surface is visible beneath the brass scientific instrument, akin to Image A. The surface helps to position and ground the instrument in the scene, confirming its continued presence. Given the visibility and positioning of the elements in Image B, it is clear that the wooden surface remains unchanged.",
