      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tabby pattern, defined by distinctive stripes or swirls commonly found in domestic cats, is clearly visible on the cat's face and body. This maintains the characteristic appearance of a tabby cat. Comparing this with Image A, the tabby pattern is consistent in both images. The visual cues, such as the stripes on the forehead and along the back, help confirm this retention.",

      "question": "Are the cat's eyes still vivid green?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's eyes are clearly vibrant and a shade of green, a common eye color for cats. This brightness and hue give the eyes a vivid appearance. Image A also shows this same color, indicating no changes have been made in the edited version. The comparison confirms that the cat's eye color is preserved.",

      "question": "Is the cat's belly and chest area still white?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cat's chest and belly areas as distinctly white, which is a typical coloration for many cats featuring a contrast with other body patterns. Image A also presents these areas as white, suggesting that nothing in the editing process altered this aspect of the cat's appearance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is depicted lying on a wooden surface, with its limbs tucked casually and its body language appearing relaxed. This position suggests comfort and calmness. Image A shows a consistent pose, on what appears to be the same wooden surface, verifying that the cat's posture and position have remained unchanged.",

      "question": "Are the fur texture and lighting effects on the cat and the wooden surface preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fur texture is detailed with discernible individual strands and a soft, realistic appearance. The lighting is dynamic, casting shadows and highlights that give depth to the image. These aspects correspond closely with those in Image A, which also shows a detailed texture and similar lighting effects. There are no noticeable alterations that would imply changes to the fur's texture or lighting conditions between the two images.",
