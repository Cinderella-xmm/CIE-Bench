    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are both arms extended horizontally to the sides, forming a symmetrical T-shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both arms are extended horizontally in a pose that resembles a T-shape. They are positioned symmetrically, suggesting a balance between the two sides. This is supported by the visual symmetry of the garment and the equal length and positioning of the arms.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the head tilted upward and slightly toward the left side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head is not tilted upward or toward any particular side; it appears centered and aligned with the body posture. The figure's gaze does not show an upward or lateral inclination, indicating a straightforward view rather than a tilted one.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the figure have a beard and hair covered by a hooded garment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) depicts a figure with long hair pulled back into a traditional Japanese samurai-style bun, and the style of the garment around the head suggests a robe or kimono style without a hood. There's no beard visible, which contrasts with the original statue that features a beard under a hood.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both hands open with palms facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both hands are depicted in a manner that suggests open palms facing outward. The position of the fingers and the orientation of the wrists indicate a welcoming gesture, commonly seen in religious or traditional art representations.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the robe cover the entire body from shoulders to the base of the statue, with vertical folds running down the front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a garment covering the body from shoulders to near the bottom of the frame, resembling a robe or kimono but lacks the specific vertical folds that are seen in traditional robes such as the one in Image A. The fabric in Image B is smoother with no distinct vertical folds.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the statue shown in a frontal pose, viewed from a low angle looking upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is depicted in a frontal pose, which is visually similar to looking at a traditional illustration straight-on and not from a low angle. The edited image adopts a classical style rather than replicating the perspective seen in the original statue's photograph.",
