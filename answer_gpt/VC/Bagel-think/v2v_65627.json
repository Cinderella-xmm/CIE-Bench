      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is depicted in a stylized cartoon form with distinct features that are recognizable such as its large ears and a prominent trunk. The cartoon nature suggests an exaggerated style often associated with such features. Based on these visual cues, the elephant retains its large ears and trunk shape, which are key identifying features.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the elephant wearing a yellow hat placed on top of its head, which is visually evident from the yellow color and placement. Also, there is a yellow collar around its neck, further accentuating the elephant's attire. These elements are clear due to their size, color contrast against the elephant's gray body, and typical placement of accessories.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant character has clearly visible black eyes, which are typical in stylized cartoon depictions as they help create an expressive and simplified facial representation. This stylistic choice is common for making cartoon characters more relatable and expressive.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The positioning of the features in Image B, such as the placement of the eyes, trunk, and the central positioning of the hat, indicate that the elephant is facing forward. This frontal view is typical in illustrations to convey a direct and engaging presentation by ensuring main features are visible and balanced symmetrically.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elephant in Image B is depicted in a smooth, cartoonish style, contrasting the block-style and angular construction of Image A, which has a more textured and interlocking block appearance typical of a toy model assembly. The change in artistic style from a block model to a smooth cartoon form results in a different interpretation of the same character.",
