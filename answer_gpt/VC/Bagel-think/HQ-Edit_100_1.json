      "question": "Does the edited image retain the tree's central position with a wide, spreading canopy and visible branching structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree is positioned centrally within a wooden box display, maintaining a central position similar to Image A. The canopy is wide and spreads out over the box space, though the branching structure is stylized and less detailed compared to Image A. The essential characteristics of a central position and wide canopy are retained, even though artistic elements differ.",

      "question": "Are the leaves of the tree still displaying a visible gradient from green to orange and red?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves of the tree are presented in a colorful, stylized manner, using a mix of vibrant colors including green, red, and orange, similar to Image A. Despite the more uniform and decorative nature in Image B, the gradient effect from green to warmer tones is depicted through these colors.",

      "question": "Is the meadow clearly divided into a pink/red floral area on the left and a green daisy-filled area on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the meadow is divided into two distinct sections: the left side displays pink/red flowers, and the right side shows predominantly green grass with some daisy-like decorations. This division reflects a similar arrangement to that of Image A, signifying the same intended split.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are white daisies still present in the green section of the meadow on the right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the lower right section of the meadow in Image B, there are white daisy-like elements visible amidst the grass, consistent with Image A's depiction of daisies in this area. The presence of these white flowers aligns with the original image's styling.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backlight or glow effect seen in Image A is absent. Image B uses solid colors and doesn't depict the dynamic lighting effects seen in Image A, which contributed to the glowing effect through the leaves.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree's base appears as part of the stylized diorama without visible roots extending into the ground, unlike in Image A where the base is naturally integrated into the meadow. The tree stands as a decorative element above the meadow without any indication of rootedness.",
