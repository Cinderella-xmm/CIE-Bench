      "question": "Is the character wearing a rust-orange jacket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a chibi character in different poses, with each instance showing a similar rust-orange jacket. The visual cues suggest the jacket is consistent across all representations.",

      "question": "Is the snowboard positioned under the character’s feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, some of the chibi characters are depicted with a snowboard under their feet, indicating that snowboarding is a part of their representation. This corresponds with the chibi design style, where details are exaggerated but still convey the intended activity.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi characters are depicted wearing black helmets, which is evident from their styling. However, there is no indication of red-tinted goggles being worn as it is primarily a stylistic representation not detailed enough for color differentiation in goggles.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the chibi illustration from Image B, the characters are depicted wearing dark-colored pants that can be inferred as black due to their shading and consistent representation across the stickers.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each chibi character in Image B is fully visible, with none of their body parts cut off, which is typical for sticker-like designs where each figure is complete.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each chibi character appears to be wearing gloves that are visually dark enough to be inferred as black, aligning with their general outfit theme.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B consists of standalone chibi characters without environmental background details such as snow-covered evergreen trees, as it is a set of stickers with only the characters depicted.",
