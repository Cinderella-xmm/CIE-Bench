      "question": "Is there a white blaze running down the center of the horse's face from the forehead to the muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see a plush toy with a facial design that includes a central white section going from the forehead to the muzzle. This is representative of a white blaze on a horse. However, since this is a toy, it may not accurately represent the horse's markings in Image A. Let’s now examine Image A, where the horse does have a distinct white blaze running down its face from the forehead to the muzzle. Based on this observation, Image B’s style pays homage to that marking.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the horse have a large white patch on its left side, extending from the shoulder toward the flank?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, featuring a plush toy, shows a broad white patch extending from the shoulder to the lower body, mimicking the horse's markings described in the question. Without cross-referencing Image A yet, this feature indicates a design intended to replicate the horse's actual markings. When reviewing Image A, the horse indeed has a similar large white patch on its left side, confirming that Image B fits this characteristic.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the horse facing slightly to the left of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush toy depicts a forward-facing position rather than facing slightly left. Initially, without referencing Image A, this feature suggests a deliberate front-view representation common in plush toys. Upon analyzing Image A, the horse is indeed facing slightly to the left. Therefore, Image B contrasts with Image A in this regard.",

      "question": "Are there multiple dandelion seed heads visible in the foreground, surrounding the horse’s legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has dandelion-like flowers positioned around the plush toy, simulating a scene where these elements are present in the environment. Without looking at Image A initially, these foreground decorations suggest such an environment exists around the horse. In Image A, many dandelion seed heads are on the ground, surrounding the real horse’s legs, similar to Image B’s intention.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a forest of tall coniferous trees visible in the background behind the horse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains felt representations of trees, indicating a wooded backdrop design. Initially, without looking at Image A, this suggests a setting meant to mimic a forest environment. Upon analyzing Image A, trees with coniferous shapes are indeed visible behind the horse, affirming that Image B intends to capture a similar ambiance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the sunlight coming from the left side of the image, casting a golden glow on the horse’s mane and left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there’s no direct lighting depiction that imitates sunlight similar to in life-like photography; the plush setup doesn't replicate directional lighting effects. Without Image A's comparison, the object design doesn’t convey light effects. But in Image A, sunlight shines from the left, casting a glow, confirming the question aspect.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the horse standing directly within the field of dandelions, with flower stalks reaching up to its legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B positions the plush toy among felt flowers on the display floor, mimicking the presence of flowers around it. This suggests proximity to a flower-like field when considered independently. Meanwhile, Image A shows the horse standing amidst dandelions, with stalks near its legs, thus aligning with Image B's intended display.",

      "question": "Are both ears of the horse upright and pointing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush toy's design gives it ears that are clearly upright and facing forward, an iconic portrayal for plush toys that reflects attentiveness or curiosity. Without checking against Image A, this detail adds character to the toy. Upon examining Image A, the horse indeed has both ears in that position, making Image B a fine representation of the horse's stance.",
