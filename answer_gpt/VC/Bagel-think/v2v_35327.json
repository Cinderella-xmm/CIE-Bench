      "question": "Is the figureâ€™s skin uniformly colored in a vivid blue tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skin of the figure is primarily in a vivid blue tone, which covers the entire visible body including the head, shoulders, and hand. This consistency in color suggests uniform application. The skin appears to be rendered with a glossy finish, adding vibrancy and saturation to the blue hue.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the banana rendered in a metallic gold color with a curved, elongated shape resembling a real banana?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the banana with a metallic gold color, displaying a shiny property that reflects light. The banana is shaped in a manner that mimics the natural curve and elongation typical of a real banana, although the color is altered to an unnatural gold hue.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, ears) clearly visible and anatomically recognizable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the ears and neck outline are visible, the facial features such as the eyes, nose, and mouth are not visible due to the blurred face editing which obscures them, making them unrecognizable.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the hand visible and positioned near the banana, suggesting a prior or ongoing interaction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand is clearly visible, with fingers positioned around the banana. This positioning logically suggests that the hand is holding or supporting the banana, implying ongoing or recent interaction with the object.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the figure shown in a side profile with the head turned slightly forward, facing right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the figure in a side profile with the head turned forward, facing towards the banana held in the hand. The alignment of the body and the curve of the neck suggest the head is facing right relative to the positioning of the body.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a background behind the figure, even if it is transformed or warped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents an elaborate background filled with swirling, colorful, and fluid-like elements that add texture and movement behind the figure. Despite its transformed and artistic nature, it serves as a background to the primary subject.",
