      "question": "Does the bird retain its bright yellow plumage with orange accents on its wings and tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird clearly has a bright yellow plumage, which is consistent with its distinct coloring. There is no indication of significant orange accents on the wings and tail visible in Image B. The focus on the visual cue of the bright yellow color and the lack of visible orange are critical in determining the answer.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is shown perched on a branch which appears to be resting on a balcony railing or similar structure. This visual information, combined with the understanding of bird behavior, indicates that the bird is indeed perched despite potentially different environmental elements around it.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
