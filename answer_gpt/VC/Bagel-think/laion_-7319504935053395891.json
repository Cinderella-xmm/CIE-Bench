    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the conical, tiered structure composed of multiple horizontal levels stacked vertically preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the observable structure is a packaging box with a pyramid-like shape rather than a conical, tiered structure. It lacks multiple horizontal levels stacked vertically, which characterize a tiered design. This indicates that the conical, tiered structure is not present in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the teardrop-shaped chocolate droplets positioned at the center of each tier preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teardrop-shaped droplets can be seen in the center of the package design, but they are part of the decoration on the box itself rather than on distinct tiers. Because there are no tiers in the packaging found in Image B, these are not preserved in the context of tiers.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the chocolate pinecone-like structures supporting each tier preserved in their original form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show chocolate pinecone-like structures supporting tiers because there are no multiple horizontal tiers in the first place. The supporting structure, therefore, is not preserved as there is no evidence of such elements present in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the nuts (including almonds, pecans, and hazelnuts) visibly contained within the teardrop-shaped droplets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, teardrop-shaped elements are part of the packaging design, and from the partial view that's accessible, it can be inferred that nuts are illustrated or contained within these shapes, as suggested by the visible areas and common chocolate product packaging designs using these motifs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wide, circular base with a horizontal band at its edge preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B represents a triangular prism-like box, not a structure with a wide, circular base. Hence, the base described in the original setup is not present in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the overall color scheme dominated by deep brown tones with gold highlights preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color scheme indeed uses deep brown tones with indications of gold highlights, consistent with a luxurious chocolate presentation, ensuring that this color theme remains apparent.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the teardrop-shaped droplets centrally aligned along the vertical axis of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given the context of Image B, the structure is now a package design, and though the teardrop-shaped droplets are not centrally aligned within a tiered structure, they are prominently featured on the packaging. However, they are not structurally aligned along any vertical axis since the concept of vertical tiers does not apply here.",
