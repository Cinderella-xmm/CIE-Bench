      "question": "Are the rectangular-framed glasses present on the subject's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show a character dressed in historical clothing without any modern accessories, such as rectangular-framed glasses. Combining this with common knowledge about historical attire, glasses were not part of traditional historical portraiture. Therefore, the analysis concludes that there are no glasses present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the gray and white beard and mustache present on the subject's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a character in historical attire, which typically does not align with modern facial hair appearances like gray and white beards. The styling observed in the edited image suggests a focus on a youthful or regal appearance, which further suggests the absence of such facial characteristics.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the graying hair visible on the top and sides of the subject's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject in Image B is stylized with non-modern, possibly darker hair typical in classical paintings, not showing signs of graying that might indicate age or a contemporary setting.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is a ring visible on the ring finger of the subject's left hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is portrayed with detailed clothing and accessories that might represent an affluent or noble figure. The close examination of this image does not show a ring on the visible hand, possibly because the image focuses on other elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hands in Image B appear stylized and in line with artistic representations found in historical or classical art. While they are proportionate and match the clothing style, the skin tone is that of a painting, rather than a realistic photograph, as the original natural tone seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the facial structure, including the nose, jawline, and eye spacing, consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Without referring to the blurred face, the subject in Image B is rendered with stylized artistic features typical in classical artwork, which tends to idealize features and may not represent the unique and specific attributes present in the photograph of Image A.",
