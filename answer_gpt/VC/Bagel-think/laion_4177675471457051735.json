      "question": "Is the deep burgundy lip color present on the subject's lips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lips are not visible due to the blurred face. Based solely on the visible elements, such as the attire and jewelry, one cannot definitively identify the lip color. Thus, the presented visual information cannot confirm whether a deep burgundy lip color is present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the black beaded mesh veil covering the forehead and extending over the eyes present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, there is no evidence of a black beaded mesh veil visible in the region above the blurred face or extended over any visible areas such as the forehead, as jewelry and attire are more distinctly ornate in an artistic painting style.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are large, dangling earrings attached to the earlobes, featuring a multi-tiered, ornate structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the earrings are clearly visible, exhibiting a large and ornate design typical of a historical portrait style. They feature multi-tiered elements, suggesting opulence and complexity similar to those seen in period pieces. Hence, based on the visible jewelry surrounding the ear area, the earrings meet the described criteria.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the eyes positioned symmetrically, with a prominent nose and defined jawline visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central facial features, including the eyes, nose, and jawline, are obscured by the blurred face. Therefore, characteristics such as symmetry of eyes or prominence of other features cannot be verified.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gown prominently features ornate embellishments with a historical and elaborate aesthetic. However, it does not showcase a deep V-neckline with triangular spike designs. The visible garment elements are more consistent with historical attire rather than the modern style described.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the subjectâ€™s skin tone warm and evenly toned without visible discoloration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, any judgment on the skin tone is obstructed by the blur. In the historical portrait style depicted, the skin tone would traditionally appear more as a painted texture than a natural photographic tone. Thus, the description of skin tonality cannot be assessed accurately.",
