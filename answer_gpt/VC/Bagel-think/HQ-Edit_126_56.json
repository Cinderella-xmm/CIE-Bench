    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a river running down the center of the image from the foreground to the distant mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which is a geometric abstraction, there is a long, white, triangular shape extending from the foreground towards the mountains, consistent with the central positioning typically associated with a river in landscape art. This suggests the presence of a river, albeit stylized. This shape creates a visual line connecting the foreground to the distant background, aligning with common representations of a river flowing through a landscape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there two large mountain peaks visible in the background, one on the left and one on the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features two prominent triangular forms at the upper left and right corners, indicative of mountain peaks when considering the style's simplified, angular representation. The larger size and positioning at the top of the image emphasize their prominence in the scene, reflecting common depictions of mountain backgrounds in landscapes.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a bright circular light source positioned near the center of the horizon line in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a circular yellow shape above the horizon line, likely representing the sun. Its central placement and circular form suggest it is meant to depict a light source situated near the horizon, commonly seen in landscapes to illustrate a sun effect.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there trees present on both sides of the river, extending along the banks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the triangular shapes extending along both sides of the 'river' area can represent stylized trees. These angular forms mimic the structure of coniferous trees, often depicted lining riverbanks in landscapes, suggesting the presence of trees along the water's edge.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible rock formations or landmasses within the river, breaking the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include distinct shapes within the white triangular area representing a river. The stylized approach omits intricate details for features like rocks, focusing instead on broad shapes. Therefore, no formations break the surface as no such obstructions are illustrated in this geometric representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the river reflect the trees and sky above it, maintaining a mirrored image across the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B's abstract form, reflections are not clearly depicted within the white shape representing the river. In this style, detailed reflections are typically not depicted due to its reliance on bold, simplified forms and color blocks, hence the river does not maintain a mirrored image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the trees on the riverbanks colored in warm autumn tones such as red, orange, and yellow, with dark green conifers interspersed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see varied color blocks on both riverbanks, including tones like orange and red, alongside dark shapes that could represent conifers. These suggest an abstract representation of autumn foliage, matching the warm color scheme typical for this season.",
