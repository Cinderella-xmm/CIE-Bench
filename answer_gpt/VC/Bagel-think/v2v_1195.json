      "question": "Is the skateboard's distinct elongated rectangular shape with rounded ends retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard is depicted with a vibrant, stained-glass-style design that alters its appearance. However, despite this change in texture and color, the skateboard maintains its elongated rectangular shape with rounded ends. This conclusion is drawn by focusing on the outline of the skateboard, which, in both images, possesses these attributes indicative of a typical skateboard shape.",

      "question": "Is the stainless steel sink's oval shape and placement on the countertop retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sink is integrated into a stained-glass-themed background. Despite the artistic changes around it, the sink retains its oval shape and placement on the countertop. This observation can be confirmed by identifying the basin and faucet in Image B, which are typical features of a sink placed on a countertop.",

      "question": "Are the wooden cabinets with silver handles and their arrangement retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the cabinets with an elaborate stained-glass design that completely transforms their appearance. While Image A features standard wooden cabinets with silver handles arranged in a straightforward manner, Image B presents a drastically different aesthetic that does not exhibit the wooden material or the simple arrangement. Thus, focusing on the color and design transformation, it is apparent that the wooden cabinet's features are not retained in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the skateboard still leaning against the cabinet in the same position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the position of the skateboard remains consistent with its placement in Image A, leaning against what was once a wooden cabinet area. Despite the change in cabinet appearance due to the stained-glass style, the skateboard continues to lean at the same angle and spatial location on the ground. This is deduced by comparing the skateboard's angle and spatial relationship with the sink area and adjacent floor tiles.",

      "question": "Are the beige tile patterns on the floor and white tile patterns on the wall retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floor tiles retain their beige color and pattern, maintaining consistency with those seen in Image A. However, the wall tiles are transformed into a vivid stained-glass design, deviating from the white tile pattern seen in Image A. This transformation on the wall is noticeable through the change in color and design complexity, indicating the white tiles are not retained.",
