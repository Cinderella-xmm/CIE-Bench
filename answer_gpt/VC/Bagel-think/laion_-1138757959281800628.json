      "question": "Are the orange vertical support beams still present along the edges of the hotel building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hotel structure appears to have green foliage covering where the vertical support beams would be. Based on visual cues, it seems the orange beams are not visible beneath the foliage. Using world knowledge about the original design, the presence of vertical support beams is typically for structural purposes, but in this edited image, they are obscured by greenery. Therefore, the orange beams are not discernible in this edited version.",

      "question": "Is the lower part of the hotel building still painted in light blue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the lower part of the building clearly maintaining the light blue coloration. The edited image keeps this aspect consistent, as there is no indication of significant change in that area. Using knowledge of painting practices and structural designs, buildings often have color schemes that are retained in altered visual depictions unless specifically changed.",

      "question": "Are the white columns supporting the ground floor of the hotel still visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white columns under the building are still visible and appear similar to their portrayal in Image A. These structures are essential for the architectural integrity of the building, so despite differences in other parts of the design or colors, they are still necessary and visible, according to structural design knowledge.",

      "question": "Is the swimming pool still kidney-shaped in outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When looking at Image B, the swimming pool appears identical in shape to a typical kidney-shape pool that curves and narrows slightly at one end, just as seen in Image A. The visual clues align with that common pool shape, illustrating the curved and round contour typical of a kidney-shaped pool.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows blue sun loungers positioned around the poolside just as seen in Image A. This arrangement is common in pool-side settings to provide guests with lounging and sunbathing options. The blue color and layout around the pool's perimeter are consistent with the original setup.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, green-and-white striped umbrellas are not clearly visible, suggesting that the editing process altered the visibility or possibly removed these specific umbrellas. Normally, pool umbrellas will have designs that stand out, and while other elements like loungers are still identifiable, the specific stripes on umbrellas in this image are not discernible.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there still people visible sunbathing on loungers or swimming in the pool?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows fewer discernible human figures due to stylization effects, such as blurring or focusing adjustments commonly used in edited images to emphasize certain elements over human presence. This suggests that any apparent people are not obviously showcased compared to Image A, where human activity is a clear focal point.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pool's positioning appears consistent with Image A, showcasing a layout where it sits directly in front of the hotel building. This position is typical for hotel designs, providing convenient access for guests, and the edited image retains this layout despite other artistic or visual modifications.",
