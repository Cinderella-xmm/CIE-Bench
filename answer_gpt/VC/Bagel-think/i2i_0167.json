        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apples exhibit a glossy red skin, indicating a polished, smooth surface typical of ripe apples. There are subtle indications of white specks, which are common on apple skins, suggesting a natural appearance. World knowledge about apples confirms that these visual features are common in many apple varieties.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apples have stems protruding from their tops. These appear to be short and resemble the appearance of dried stems typically found on harvested apples. The presence of the stem in Image B is consistent with the natural appearance of an apple.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows both whole and a halved apple placed on a surface that displays a wood grain pattern and color, suggesting a wooden surface. World knowledge about furniture and natural wooden textures reinforces that this appearance is indicative of a wooden table or countertop.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apples maintain a round and three-dimensional shape that aligns with common perceptions of an apple's dimensions and form. Additionally, the portrayal is consistent from various angles, reflecting a natural and realistic volumetric form.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cross-section view in Image B shows the interior of the apple with smooth, white flesh, which is typical for many apple varieties. The seeds are also visible. However, the texture appears somewhat unrealistic or smooth compared to typical apple flesh, lacking detailed texture variations that usually characterize a real apple's interior.",
