      "question": "Is the cheetah face graphic present on the right sleeve of the subject's top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right sleeve depicts a leopard print pattern, but no specific cheetah face graphic is visible. The design appears geometric and abstract rather than featuring a distinct animal face. Comparing with Image A, which demonstrates a clear graphic of a cheetah's face on the sleeve, it is absent in Image B. Therefore, the reasoning concludes there is no cheetah face graphic on the sleeve in Image B.",

      "question": "Are both boxing gloves rendered in gold color with visible yellow laces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the boxing gloves are gold, with visible laces on each. The color is consistent across both gloves, supporting the statement that they are both rendered in gold. Additionally, the yellow laces are clear and prominently visible. Image A also depicts gold boxing gloves with visible yellow laces, confirming this feature as consistent between both images.",

      "question": "Is the leopard print pattern present on the sleeves and headscarf of the subject?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the leopard print pattern on the sleeve of the subject. The arm and chest area also showcase this print. However, there is no headscarf visible in the image; hence, the print is not applicable to a headscarf. Image A shows sleeves with leopard print and a headscarf with the same pattern, while Image B lacks the headscarf.",

      "question": "Is the headscarf worn by the subject red and black with a leopard print pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a headscarf, thus a pattern cannot be identified or confirmed. Comparing with Image A, where a headscarf is present and noted as red and black, this feature is absent in Image B, indicating the statement is inaccurate.",

      "question": "Are green palm fronds visible in the background behind the subject?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is an ornate wall with hieroglyphics, devoid of any vegetation or palm fronds. Comparing with Image A, which shows green palm fronds behind the subject, Image B lacks any such foliage, leading to the conclusion that green palm fronds are not visible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks any border featuring overlapping rectangles. Instead, the image is framed by its detailed backdrop. Image A, however, includes a distinct white geometric border with overlapping rectangles. Hence, the statement does not hold true for Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has the subject's face blurred, preventing the identification of any makeup details such as eyeshadow or lipstick. Without the ability to visually confirm these features, a comparison with Image A, which might show these features, cannot support the statement for Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's left arm is visibly raised and adorned with a gold boxing glove, consistent with the pose and accessory depicted. Image A similarly displays the raised left arm with a gold glove, supporting the posed question for Image B.",
