      "question": "Is the gray flat cap still present on the man's head, maintaining its original shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gray flat cap is visible on the man's head, maintaining a traditional flat cap shape, which appears similar in style and fit as seen in Image A. As no changes in shape or positioning are apparent, I conclude the cap's original shape and position is maintained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the small brown leather tag visible on the side of the cap near the back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a small brown leather tag is visible on the side of the cap near the back, suggesting embellishment similar to fashion details on flat caps. When comparing this to Image A, the brown leather tag remains present in the same place in Image B, indicating its visibility is consistent.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the man wearing a heather gray crew-neck t-shirt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the man in a heather gray t-shirt with a crew neck and no apparent alteration in this apparel from Image A. Thus, this suggests consistency in the shirt's type and color between both images.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "question": "Does the man have a mustache and a goatee?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the blurred face, facial features like a mustache and goatee aren't visible and cannot be confirmed. Thus, based solely on visual cues in Image B, it can't be determined if the man has these features.",
      "weight": 3,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the man indicates a side profile view, as his body is oriented sideways and facing towards the left, much like classical side profiles. This matches the orientation seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual depiction in Image B of the cap and shirt shows similar textured patterns typical of heather gray fabricâ€”a blend of light and dark fibers, as seen in Image A. Despite the artistic effect in Image B, the texture impression remains heather gray.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cap in Image B appears to rest naturally, following the contours of the man's head without obvious distortion or displacement. This view aligns with the natural fitting seen in Image A, indicating the cap's placement is consistent and appropriate.",
