    "Question": "Q1: Is the cyclist in a forward-leaning position with hands on aerobars?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cyclist is in an aerodynamic posture, leaning forward with hands on the aerobars, which is common in time trials to reduce air resistance and increase speed. This posture maximizes efficiency during cycling races.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are two bicycles mounted vertically on the roof rack of the black car?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues suggest that there is a roof rack designed to hold bicycles. Compare this with Image A, where two bikes are mounted vertically on the roof rack, visible from the vehicle. This setup is typical for supporting crew cars used in cycling events to transport equipment such as spare bikes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there white lane markings and a yellow center line on the road?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a road with distinct white lines marking the lane boundaries and a yellow line at the center, signaling high visibility and adherence to standard road marking designs for safety and navigation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there an orange traffic cone visible in the background near the cyclist?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, despite digital editing, there is no visible orange traffic cone in the background near the cyclistâ€”likely removed or unnoticed compared to Image A where there was one close to the cyclist indicating road management practices during races.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the car have a license plate reading 'BOC-480'?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a digitally altered license plate on the car featuring different text, contrasting with Image A where the license plate reads 'BOC-480'. The alteration may suggest branding or privacy-influenced modifications typical in visual content editing.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the cyclist riding parallel to the car on the same road?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cyclist is positioned adjacent to the car, suggesting they are riding parallel and in the same direction, which aligns with the common practice of time trial events where support vehicles follow cyclists closely on the same road.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the background composed of dry hills with sparse vegetation?",
    "explanation": "Image B retains the background of dry hills with minimal plant life, common in arid regions, confirming the landscape setting used in outdoor cycling events as evident in both Image A and B.",
    "answer": "Yes"
