      "question": "Is the multi-layered beaded neckpiece composed of alternating red, white, blue, and black horizontal bands still present in the same layered structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neckpiece is visually composed of multiple layers with a repetitive color pattern of red, white, blue, and black bands, which closely match the description given.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
