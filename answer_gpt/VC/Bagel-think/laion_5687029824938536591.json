      "question": "Is the triangular panel structure across the midfoot preserved in shape and spatial arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoe features a distinctive triangular panel structure across the midfoot similar to Image A. The arrangement and layout of the panels are maintained, providing structural support. By analyzing the visual cues, one can see that the geometric design and placement of these panels appear consistent with the original shoe, indicating that the shape and spatial arrangement have been preserved.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the \"SPEEDCROSS\" text positioned along the lateral side of the shoe in the same location and orientation as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'SPEEDCROSS' text is not visible on the lateral side, as the shoe appears to be artistically reimagined in a wood-like texture without the original text. By comparing Image B to the actual positioning in Image A, where the text is clearly visible, it is evident that its location and orientation are not preserved in the edited image.",

      "question": "Are the Salomon logos present on both the heel counter and tongue tab in their original positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Salomon logo is present on the lateral side similar to the original Image A. However, upon inspecting the tongue tab, the Salomon logo is not prominently visible as it is styled into the artistic interpretation. Without clear textual evidence on the tongue, it can be concluded that the logo is not present in its original position here.",

      "question": "Is the lacing system maintained with the same number and spacing of eyelets as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, it shows an artistic representation of the lacing system but generally reflects the same structure in terms of number and spacing when compared to the real shoe in Image A. The resemblance in arrangement of eyelets suggests that this aspect has been preserved effectively.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the outsole lug pattern and the \"contagrip\" text preserved in their original positions and shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the wooden texture and artistic reinterpretation change the appearance significantly, the lug pattern is mirrored in terms of structure similar to Image A. However, the 'contagrip' text is not visible in the expected original position, which is notably present in Image A. Therefore, while the pattern is preserved, the text placement is not.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the reinforced toe cap shape and the embossed \"S\" logo preserved in the same location and form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shoe in Image B shows a stylized version of the reinforced toe cap structure which generally maintains the same shape as Image A. However, the embossed 'S' logo is not visible on the toe cap in the edited image, whereas it is clearly marked on the original shoe. Hence, the shape is preserved, but the logo is not.",

      "question": "Is the \"LT LIGHT WEIGHT MIDSOLE\" label present in the same location and shape near the heel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When analyzing Image B, the 'LT LIGHT WEIGHT MIDSOLE' label is found in the anticipated location near the heel, similar to Image A. Despite the artistic wooden depiction, the text patch seems to remain evident and preserved in placement and orientation, indicating retention of the original label's position.",
