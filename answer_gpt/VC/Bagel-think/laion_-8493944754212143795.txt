    "Question": "Q1: Is there visible sunlight reflecting off the water surface, creating bright sparkles and highlights?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, sunlight is reflecting off the water surface, creating bright sparkles and highlights. This is evident from the light patches on the water surface, which are typical characteristics of sunlight interacting with moving water. These reflections add dynamic lighting to the scene, which is consistent with how sunlight would appear on a naturally flowing water surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there visible patches of green moss or algae on the rock surfaces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the patches of green moss or algae are clearly visible on the rocks, similar to what is observed in Image A. These green areas are natural indicators of moss or algae growth on surfaces frequently exposed to water, providing a contrasting hue to the otherwise rocky and watery elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there white, foamy water at the base of the cascade and along the edges of the flow?",
    "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, shows white, foamy water at the base of the cascade and along the edges of the water flow. This foam is typical of water that has been agitated as it falls or makes contact with surfaces, indicating turbulent flow conditions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the rocks exhibit a layered, stepped formation with visible cracks and erosion lines?",
    "explanation": "The rocks in Image B exhibit a layered, stepped formation with visible cracks and erosion lines. This formation is consistent with natural rock formations that develop over time due to processes such as erosion and sediment deposition, leading to steps and irregular surfaces.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the water flow downward from the upper part of the image toward the lower part?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the flow of water is clearly downward from the upper part to the lower part of the image. This is depicted by the direction of the cascade, with water visibly running downwards over the rocks, following gravity as the slope descends.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a clear contrast between the dark, wet rock surfaces and the bright, fast-moving water?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear contrast between the dark, wet rock surfaces and the bright, fast-moving water. This contrast is enhanced by the reflective properties of the water, which make it appear brighter in areas where sunlight hits, compared to the darker tones of the wet rocks.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are there visible water droplets or mist suspended in the air above the falling water?",
    "explanation": "Image B features water droplets or mist suspended in the air above the falling water. These droplets are typical of waterfalls where water violently interacts with air, often forming a mist that catches the light and provides additional texture to the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
