      "question": "Is the brand name \"Karls\" clearly visible on the label of the jar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brand name 'Karls' would typically be identified by clear typography commonly placed on product labels to ensure brand recognition. However, in this image, there is no obvious depiction of a traditional jar label or recognizable brand symbols; instead, the illustration focuses on caricature representations. Therefore, there is no clear visibility of 'Karls' or any brand name on a jar label.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the text \"Pumpkin Spice Popcorn\" present on the label of the jar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B consists of animated characters and does not feature conventional jars with labels including textual information like 'Pumpkin Spice Popcorn'. The design and purpose seem directed at stylized imagery rather than a realistic representation of products with textual descriptions.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the popcorn contained in a clear glass jar with a silver metal lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays animated bowls rather than jars. These are depicted in vibrant blue and orange colors without reflective or transparent qualities indicating glass jars. The lids or tops are represented with cartoon hats rather than typical jar lids, suggesting no traditional jar present.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a white ceramic bowl with a blue rim containing popped popcorn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are zoomorphic, animated bowls depicted which are primarily orange, not white ceramic bowls with a blue trim. These designs cater to a fun and whimsical representation, differing from traditional ceramic bowl designs.",

      "question": "Are unpopped corn kernels visible in a separate clear jar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B solely represents animated bowls with popcorn but lacks separate jars or visible unpopped corn kernels. The picture is designed to be playful and animated rather than a realistic portrayal with such specific elements like jars containing unpopped kernels.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors of the labels and popcorn orange and brown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, orange is the dominant color visible in the popcorn and surrounding imagery. However, brown is not a predominant color in the composition or among labels, as it appears more animated with a range of cartoonish elements and colorful representations.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "question": "Is the scene set on a wooden surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a series of animated depictions without a clear background setting like a wooden surface. The focus is entirely on stylized character presentations, emphasizing cartoonish elements rather than realistic settings.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are unpopped or popped popcorn kernels scattered on the surface around the jars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting is animated with no clearly defined surface or scattered real kernels around jars. Instead, the image focuses on illustrated popcorn within bowls, indicating no realistic scattering of kernels or jars present.",
