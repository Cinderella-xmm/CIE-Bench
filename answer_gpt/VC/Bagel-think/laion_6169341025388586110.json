      "question": "Is the trident with three prongs clearly visible and held vertically in the right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trident is clearly visible in the right hand and has a vertical orientation. This analysis is based on the visual cue of seeing a long pole in the right hand of the statue ending in a classic trident shape, with three distinct prongs at its head, held vertically.",

      "question": "Is the damaru (small drum) held in the upper left hand with a cylindrical shape and horizontal orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a cylindrical object is visible in the upper left hand, and it has a horizontal orientation. This is consistent with the typical representation of a damaru, confirming its identity and position based on the visual cues of shape and orientation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a serpent coiled around the neck and shoulder area, with its head raised near the right shoulder. This conclusion derives from recognizing the distinct shape and texture typically associated with a serpent in religious iconography.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no indication of a third eye being present on the forehead; the imagery focuses on the other symbolic elements of the statue without including a visible third eye.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction in Image B does not show a crescent moon in the hair above the forehead. This conclusion is based on the deliberate observation of the hair region, which lacks any crescent shapes or additional adornments resembling a moon.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows no dark beads originating from the neck area. This is confirmed through observation of the neck region, which appears clear of mala or bead strings that are typically used as spiritual or religious adornments.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand is clutching the trident and not depicting the abhaya mudra, which involves the palm facing outward with fingers in specific positions. This visual examination does not show fingers pointing upwards in this traditional gesture.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Golden bangles are visible on both wrists in Image B. Each wrist has a circular adornment matching the typical representation and appearance of bangles, seen through careful observation of the wrist areas.",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue appears to be seated in a cross-legged position, as indicated by the arrangement of the legs where one leg is crossed over the other, and the feet are not positioned on the lap. This analysis is conducted by observing the lower part of the statue.",
      "weight": 2,
