    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the onion-shaped dome on top of the bell tower retained in the same form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the onion-shaped dome remains visible on top of the bell tower. This can be reasoned from the visual cues combined with the world knowledge that such a dome is typically distinctively shaped, and its presence can be identified in the same way as in architectural structures.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the clock face featuring Roman numerals and blue hands visible and correctly positioned on the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the clock face is discernible with Roman numerals and blue hands, located on the tower in proper alignment. This deduction is made through visual scrutiny, where the shape and placement align with expectations for a position of a clock face on a tower.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the black quatrefoil window present on the front of the church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the church with a noticeable feature resembling the black quatrefoil window on its front side. Identifying such architectural details relies on recognizing characteristic shapes and positions using world knowledge of church designs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bell tower attached to the church and positioned on its left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bell tower is shown inside a glass dome and appears detached visually from the whole church structure. Therefore, in its displayed form, it does not appear attached to the left side of the church but rather stands alone inside the glass casing.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the terraced vineyard patterns are not distinctly visible in the backdrop. The slopes appear smooth rather than patterned, indicating an absence of terraced features, which are typically recognizable through discernible lines on hills.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the cross mounted at the very top of the dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, analyzing the top of the dome indicates the presence of a cross mounted at its pinnacle. This is concluded through visual examination recognizing the traditional placement of crosses on domes within architectural tradition.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the lower portion of the bell tower constructed from light gray stone blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the bell tower encapsulated in a glass dome where the lower portion appears as light gray stone blocks. This matches architectural expectations for material choice as seen through visual analysis combined with world knowledge.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roof of the church is visibly covered with tiles that carry a terracotta color. This observation combines visual input with common knowledge about roof styling, particularly for traditional church designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows multiple small houses with distinctive sloped roofs positioned near the central church structure within the glass dome environment. Visual inspection confirms the presence of these common architectural features adjacent to the landscape setup.",
