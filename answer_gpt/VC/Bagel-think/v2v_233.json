      "question": "Is the leaf in the edited image still ovate with a pointed tip and serrated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf has maintained its original shape with an ovate form, pointed tip, and serrated edges. This is evident from the leaf's outline and edges, which are clearly visible within the globe. World knowledge about leaf shapes supports that this configuration is consistent with ovate leaves found in nature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the leaf retain the prominent central vein with branching secondary veins forming a network across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a leaf that appears to have a prominent central vein with secondary veins branching out, creating a network on its surface. This appearance is visible through the leaf's texture and vein patterns within the glass sphere. These visual cues align with common biological structures of leaves.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the leaf still golden-yellow with visible brown speckles and natural discolorations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf maintains a golden-yellow color with brown speckles and discolorations. This is evident from the surface coloration visible through the glass, similar to autumn leaves often seen in nature. The lighting and shadowing do not alter its inherent color and textural characteristics.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the leaf retain its papery texture and minor surface imperfections such as blemishes or spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The texture in Image B suggests that the leaf retains its papery quality along with minor imperfections like blemishes or spots. When analyzing the leaf inside the globe, these attributes appear consistent with dried leaves, which often possess an irregular surface due to weathering.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the leaf oriented with the stem pointing toward the upper left and the blade extending diagonally across the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf is positioned with the stem directed towards the upper left, and the blade diagonally extending in the image. This orientation is reflected in the leaf's placement within the snow globe, maintaining similar angles as depicted outside of the globe in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the leaf the sole central object in the edited image, without any other competing elements in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a leaf inside a snow globe with other elements present, such as snowflakes and background. These elements provide additional visual interest separate from the leaf, making it not the sole focus. The snowflakes add complexity to the foreground imagery.",
