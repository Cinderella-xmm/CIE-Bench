      "question": "Does the bag character retain its earthy tones and brown leather straps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the bag character in the comic retains the same visual appearance as the original object in Image A with earthy tones and brown leather straps. The characteristics such as the color palette and design seem consistent with common stylistic choices for bags, which often utilize earthy tones for a natural look.",

      "question": "Is the bag character's structural design, including visible stitching, preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows that the bag character resembles the styling of a typical bag, and key features like the straps and surface appear defined and characteristic of a bag's structural design. This includes visible stitching that defines the panel seams as seen in most bags, a natural expectation. When comparing to Image A, these design elements are similar, hence, the structural design is preserved.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the bowl character retain its white color and original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no separate entity depicted as a bowl character in the same manner as Image A. Instead, the bowl appears to be integrated into the bag character as a leg or appendage, which alters the context. Thus, the visual separate identity and attributes such as the white color and original standalone shape are not retained.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the wooden floor present in the background of both manga panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B panels show flooring with a wooden appearance, similar to the flooring in Image A, which features a defined, polished wood surface. This consistency suggests the background setting remains unchanged to maintain continuity. Given general comic panel context, any design would need to draw from existing environmental elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "In both panels, is the bag character positioned near the bowl character, similar to their original placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the relationship between the functional characters has changed; the 'bowl' part appears to be integrated into the bag character itself as part of the design in at least one of the panels, rather than being separately positioned as seen in Image A. This transforms their relational context from being side by side to being a unified character, suggesting a shifted visual narrative.",
