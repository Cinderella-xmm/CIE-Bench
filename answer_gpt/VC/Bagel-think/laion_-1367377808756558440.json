      "question": "Is the hull number \"J244\" clearly visible and positioned on the side of the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship is encapsulated within a glass dome, appearing more like a steampunk or fantasy ship rather than a realistic WWII ship as seen in Image A. The hull number 'J244' is not visible on the side of the ship in Image B. Therefore, the image does not feature any clearly visible hull numbering, unlike in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the British flag flying from the secondary mast of the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are flags on the masts. Upon close inspection, one of these flags has the distinct design of the Union Jack, the British flag, indicating that a British-associated flag is flying on this ship. Image A features a different set of flags, fitting the context of where the ship is docked in the real world, unlike the miniaturized and fantasy representation in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the ship retain its original silhouette with a tall mast, funnel, and forward gun mount?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship has been significantly altered in its representation; it's enclosed in a glass dome with whimsical and steampunk elements. While it retains key components like masts and funnels, the overall silhouette is altered from Image A. The original realistic silhouette with specific military elements like gun mounts is not present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no yellow boat with any text in the foreground. The entire setting is different and more conceptual inside a dome, and it lacks any foreground boats or recognizable texts as seen in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reflects a miniature version contained inside a glass dome, focusing on the ship and its artistic details. There are no green lampposts visible with curved arms, which were present along the pier in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship's setting and flags differ significantly from its real-world depiction in Image A. The flags in Image B are stylized and do not include an Australian flag, which was visible in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire scene is contained within a dome and focuses on the ship itself without any background elements like port cranes. Therefore, naturalistic background items seen in Image A, such as the large white port cranes, are absent.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

    },

      "question": "Are three individuals visible walking along the pier near the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a miniature, artistic depiction within a dome, with no visible pier or individuals walking as seen in the realistic setting of Image A. Thus, there are no people walking near the ship in Image B.",
