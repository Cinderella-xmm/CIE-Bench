    "Question": "Q1: Is the rooster’s comb present on top of its head in a prominent, upright position?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the comb is replaced by a stylized headpiece with designs, rather than the natural fleshy comb seen in roosters. It is present on top of the head but is designed differently. By analyzing the visual element and comparing it with typical rooster anatomy, this indicates the rooster's natural comb has been altered significantly in the edited image.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the red fleshy wattles visible under the rooster’s beak?",
    "explanation": "The wattles typically appear as fleshy skin hanging under the beak, but in Image B, there are no evident fleshy wattles under the beak. Instead, there seems to be edited elements and designs. Based on the typical appearance of roosters, the absence of visible wattles leads to the conclusion.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the rooster’s beak clearly visible and positioned at the front of the face, with a pointed tip?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the beak still maintains a visible position at the front of the face with a pointed tip, despite the artistic alterations. This observation combines the basic anatomical understanding of where a rooster's beak is located and its typical shape.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the rooster have two legs with three forward-facing toes and one rear toe on each foot?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the rooster appears to have two legs. However, due to the stylistic modifications and additional decorative elements, the toes are obscured and not clearly defined. Given the common rooster anatomy, this alteration would lead to an unclear visual of the toes.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the rooster standing on a dark gray asphalt surface with visible debris such as leaves and small plant fragments?",
    "explanation": "The surface beneath the rooster in Image B looks like dark gray asphalt, similar to Image A. There are leaves and small plant fragments consistent with the description. This comparison confirms that despite the alterations to the rooster, the ground remains unchanged.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the rooster standing upright with its head raised and one foot slightly forward?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the rooster maintains an upright stance, and although obscured partially by modifications, its relative posture suggests the head is raised and one foot is slightly ahead, similar to Image A. Combining the posture and common rooster standing position allows for clarity despite alterations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the tail positioned at the rear of the rooster’s body and extending upward in a curved shape?",
    "explanation": "The tail in Image B is replaced with a stylized flame-like design extending from the rear and upwards, which substitutes the natural rooster tail seen in Image A. By contrasting normal rooster anatomy with the edited attributes, the tail’s shape has been creatively modified but still retains upward extension.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Are the neck and chest feathers arranged in overlapping layers with a golden-orange hue?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chest and neck area appears to have edited elements and a different color scheme. The typical golden-orange hue and overlapping layer arrangement seen in Image A is altered. By evaluating the visual cues and applying knowledge of rooster feather anatomy, it's clear there's significant modification.",
    "answer": "No"
