    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the cheetahs in a seated position with bent hind legs, tucked tails, and upright front paws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the objects that appear to be cheetahs are standing upright as opposed to sitting. They are bottles, evidenced by their vertical, rectangular shape that is characteristic of perfume bottles. This does not match the description of a seated position with bent hind legs or upright front paws.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the head of each cheetah turned slightly to the side, away from the central divider?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottles do not possess animal features such as heads. The objects have a straight form that does not align with any head turned to the side. Thus, there's nothing analogous to a cheetah's head turned away from a divider.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does each cheetah rest on a two-tiered base with a black upper section and a bronze-colored stepped lower section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows perfume bottles which rest on a base. However, this base consists of a singular color scheme dominated by green. There's no evidence of a bronze-colored stepped section characteristic of two-tiered bases.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the cheetah figures positioned symmetrically, one on the left and one on the right, equidistant from the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents two perfume bottles symmetrically placed on either side of a green central strip, confirming that they are equidistant from the center. This symmetry mirrors the description.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there exactly three vertical panels positioned between the cheetahs, with two narrower ones flanking a wider central one?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is one vertical green structure between the two bottles. Therefore, there aren't three vertical panels as the question describes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the tail of each cheetah curve upward and rest on the base behind the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given that in Image B there are no tails featured on the objects, the large cylindrical perfume bottle tops do not suggest tails. Thus, no curved tails rest on any base as they have no animal-like form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
