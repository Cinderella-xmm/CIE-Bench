      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central bubble tea cup has changed from a purple color to a yellow color, particularly the main body of the cup. The lid and the liquid's reflection inside the cup still have some purple elements, which indicate a partial retention of the purple palette. However, since the overall prominent color has changed to yellow, it does not retain the original purple color palette. Comparing this to Image A, which features a uniform purple tone throughout, the predominant purple color theme is absent in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black round shapes at the bottom of the cup are representative of tapioca pearls, which are typically included in bubble tea. They are similar to the ones depicted in Image A, where black tapioca pearls are visibly aligned at the bottom of the cup. Thus, the design of the creature in Image B does include tapioca pearls.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a feature protruding from the top of the bubble tea cup, resembling a straw. This is consistent with Image A, where a straw is depicted as protruding from the cup's lid. Based on this observed feature, the design in Image B does include a straw-like element.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a glossy effect on the dome lid of the bubble tea cup, suggesting a shiny, reflective surface. This effect can be observed as a bright streak on the lid and part of the cup, mimicking a similar glossy look to Image A's cup, where a reflective sheen is also visible. Therefore, the creature does incorporate a glossy texture.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a cartoon face with yellow star-shaped eyes is visible on the front of the bubble tea cup. This resembles the face from Image A, which also features a similar cute expression with star-shaped eyes. Based on this visual feature, it is clear that the creature in Image B has a cute face with yellow star eyes.",
