      "question": "Does the ship retain exactly three masts, with sails arranged in tiers on each mast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature ship inside the globe has exactly three masts, each equipped with multiple sails stacked vertically in tiers, which is characteristic of traditional sailing ships. Based on the visual cues in Image B, yes, the ship has exactly three masts with sails arranged in tiers on each mast.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the ship’s hull shaped with a raised stern and a decorated, upward-curving prow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship inside the globe has a hull design typical of historical vessels, featuring a stern that is indeed raised and a prow that curves slightly upward. There isn't prominent decoration visible on the prow in Image B, keeping the design simple and streamlined.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there multiple sails on each of the three masts, with at least two tiers per mast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a miniature ship with three masts, and importantly, each mast supports multiple sails arranged in tiers, fulfilling the criteria of having at least two tiers per mast. This is a recognizable pattern seen in many traditional sailing vessels displayed in model form.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there at least five seagulls visible in flight around the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible seagulls around the ship within the globe. However, upon counting, the number of seagulls visibly flying around the miniature ship is less than five, primarily due to the limited space on the model. Thus, there are not at least five seagulls around the ship.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the ship oriented such that the bow points toward the left side of the image and is slightly elevated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship inside the globe appears with the bow directed towards the left side of the image. Although the bow is slightly elevated, the primary orientation suggests leftward pointing, consistent with a typical display setting for showcasing the side profile of model ships.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible portholes along the sides of the ship’s hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature ship's hull displayed within the globe does not distinctly showcase visible portholes. The design focuses more on overall structural aesthetics rather than detailing with features like portholes which might be minimized due to the scale and presentation form in the globe.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the ship positioned above the surface of the water/resin layer, appearing to float?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship is encapsulated within a globe and positioned above a resin-like layer designed to mimic water, giving the illusion of floating without actual water as the material is resin. Considering the presentation within the globe, yes, the ship appears to float above the resin layer.",
