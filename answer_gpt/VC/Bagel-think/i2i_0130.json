      "question": "Is the fireplace still centrally located on the wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fireplace is visibly placed at the center of the wall, serving as a focal point of the room's layout. This arrangement is typical in interior settings where the fireplace acts as a central feature for aesthetic and practical reasons. By analyzing the symmetry and design of the room, it's evident that the fireplace remains centrally located.",

      "question": "Are there still wall-mounted light fixtures visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any wall-mounted light fixtures. Instead, the lighting seems to rely on natural illumination from the fire and possibly overhead lights not directly visible. This suggests there are no wall fixtures present, contrasting with traditional setups where such fixtures might flank a fireplace.",

      "question": "Are there still decorative items placed above the fireplace?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Above the fireplace in Image B, there appears to be a minimal treatment with no clear decorative items visible, such as vases, sculptures, or art. The mantel shelf itself is decorated with subtle detailing, but lacks prominently placed items. This observation leads to the conclusion that decorative items are indeed absent.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two sofas are arranged symmetrically facing each other with the fireplace centrally located, forming a common configuration for maximizing warmth and social interaction around a fireplace. Thus, the seating continues to orient towards the central focus provided by the fireplace.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a color palette characterized by cool tones dominated by shades of stone and subtle blues reflected in the stone walls and floor, diverging from warm tones typical of traditional fireplaces. This contrasts with common warm hues like oranges and reds, indicating a shift to a cooler ambiance with less emphasis on warmth in the color scheme.",
