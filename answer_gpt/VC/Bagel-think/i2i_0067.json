      "question": "Are the horses still brown with distinct markings, including the white marking on one leg?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the blurring, it is not possible to discern any colors or markings of the horses, including the white marking on one leg. Without visual cues, it's impossible to confirm the horses' characteristics.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is entirely blurred, making it impossible to see any objects, including the wire fence. Without visual confirmation, I cannot confirm the presence or positioning of the fence.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurred nature of Image B makes it impossible to determine if distant trees and the landscape are present as they cannot be seen. Thus, the background features are not visible.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurriness of Image B eliminates all visual cues, including lighting and mood, making it impossible to assess the lighting conditions or the ambiance of the image.",
