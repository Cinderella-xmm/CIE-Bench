      "question": "Does the chibi-style keychain retain the round glasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visual cues in Image B show a chibi-style character without visible round glasses. Common world knowledge tells us that keychains often simplify features, such as glasses, especially in chibi designs where facial detail is minimal or non-existent. Therefore, based on the visible features and typical design simplifications in such merchandise, the character's glasses are not retained in the chibi-style keychain.",

      "question": "Does the chibi-style keychain maintain the brown hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the chibi character with brown hair. The keychain design features distinctive chibi character traits like oversized hair, reflected in the brown color, which matches typical depictions of the character in popular culture. Therefore, the chibi-style keychain maintains the brown hair.",

      "question": "Are the white shirt and red-and-yellow striped tie present on the chibi-style keychain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character does not show any visible white shirt or red-and-yellow striped tie, but instead is wearing a red-and-yellow scarf, which is a common accessory swap in chibi designs. Chibi merchandise often alters or simplifies clothing details for style or manufacturing reasons. Therefore, the white shirt and striped tie are not present in the chibi-style keychain.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the chibi character wearing a dark cloak similar to the one seen in popular representations of certain characters. This matches with typical character designs to maintain iconic elements while simplifying them in chibi form. Therefore, the dark cloak is included in the chibi-style keychain design.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style keychain maintain the overall original color scheme, including skin, hair, glasses, shirt, tie, and cloak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style keychain in Image B maintains the hair color and cloak color from the original depiction but excludes certain elements like glasses and shirt/tie combination, altering the overall color scheme slightly with the scarf replacing the tie. Therefore, it does not fully maintain the original color scheme.",
