    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the \"Fujitsu fi-7160\" model name and logo visibly present on the top-left portion of the scanner in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scanner is displayed within a holographic effect, which obscures certain details, like logos and model names, commonly visible in a straightforward photograph. In general, the model name and branding tend to be located in a predictable location, like the top-left corner, based on the original Image A. However, in Image B, due to the artistic overlay, these details cannot be discerned explicitly.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the automatic document feeder (ADF) tray open and holding multiple documents, including a boarding pass, receipt, and payment slip, in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a holographic rendition of the scanner, which doesn't depict physical documents like boarding passes and receipts with detailed clarity. In Image A, we see the actual documents, such as a boarding pass and receipt, loaded in the ADF. In contrast, Image B lacks these specific document details due to its holographic style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the five control buttons (Menu, Stop/Clear, Scan/Enter, Power, and directional navigation) arranged in the same configuration on the right side of the scanner in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's holographic effect does not clearly display the control buttons. In Image A, the buttons are distinctly arranged on the right side of the scanner. However, due to the abstract representation in Image B, these button details are not clearly identifiable.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the power button illuminated in green on the right-side control panel of the scanner in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the artistic and abstract style, specific features like an illuminated power button are not discernible. In the original Image A, the green illumination is a direct feature of the power button. The holographic view does not convey such specific illumination details.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the row of bristle rollers visible beneath the scanning bed of the scanner in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the holographic display does not show the internal details like bristle rollers, which are visible in Image A under normal circumstances. The stylized representation in Image B obscures such features, focusing more on the outer form.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the boarding pass, receipt, and payment slip clearly visible in the ADF tray with readable text such as \"Boarding Pass\", \"Receipt\", and \"Payment Slip\" in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the holographic display of Image B, details such as specific documents with readable text, seen clearly in Image A, are not visible. The holographic imaging lacks precise text readability, focusing more on the overall geometric representation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the scanner in the holographic display maintain the original black and light gray color scheme of the Fujitsu fi-7160?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the scanner with a color scheme that is notably different due to the holographic overlay, which incorporates additional colors and effects. In Image A, the original black and light gray color scheme is shown. The holographic view does not reflect this original color scheme faithfully.",
