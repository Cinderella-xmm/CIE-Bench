      "question": "Is the woman’s gray hair styled in a neat bun atop her head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s hair is noticeably styled in a manner that resembles a bun. This is evident by the rounded shape atop her head, which is commonly associated with a bun hairstyle. Without considering Image A, this visual characteristic allows us to conclude that her hair is indeed styled in a bun. Therefore, based solely on Image B and common hairstyle knowledge, the answer is clear.",

      "question": "Does the woman wear a light blue blouse with long sleeves and a V-shaped neckline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is wearing a garment that is light blue in color. The sleeves of the blouse are visibly long, and the neckline appears to form a V-shape. These details align with the description given in the question. Therefore, based on the visual evidence in Image B and combining it with the understanding of garment styles, the answer is affirmative.",

      "question": "Is the trowel held in the woman’s right hand and partially buried in the soil of the garden bed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the woman holding a gardening tool, but upon closer examination, it doesn't resemble a trowel, which is a small hand tool for digging. Instead, she is holding what appears to be a different type of gardening implement in her right hand, which is digging into the soil. The description indicates a trowel specifically, and given this mismatch, relying on the common definition of a trowel, the answer is negative.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, on the right side of the garden bed, there appears to be a silver object that resembles a watering can.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, directly beneath the woman's feet, there is a distinct pathway that appears wooden in nature. This pathway extends in the direction toward the background of the image, fitting the description provided in the question.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the left side of Image B, part of a wooden structure is visible, which by the design appears to resemble a gazebo. It includes features such as a balcony and is partially hidden by surrounding foliage. The description of a gazebo in a garden setting fits this observation.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection of the right side of Image B, there isn’t an obvious structure that matches the description of a pavilion with a lattice window. The presence of numerous flowers might obscure such details, but based on what is visible, this feature is not evident. Given the lack of a noticeable pavilion with specific details in view, the answer is negative.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backdrop behind the woman features various plants and flowers. Neither a distinct cluster of yellow marigolds nor pink roses appears prominently in large clusters, but rather a mix of various floral types is seen throughout without a clear emphasis on marigolds and roses specifically. Based on the visible floral arrangement and understanding of common garden layouts, the answer is negative.",
