      "question": "Is the shallow wooden tray beneath the tagine present and retaining its original shape, material, and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object of focus has changed from a tagine atop a wooden tray in Image A to an intricately designed metal jug-like vessel. There is no indication of a wooden tray in Image B. The edited image depicts this metallic container with a new mystical theme, and the position, shape, and material have distinctly changed from the original wooden tray.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glass bottle containing golden olive oil with a cork stopper visible in the background, resting on a small pedestal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a mystical-themed setting with a central metallic jug and glowing orbs. There is no presence or visualization of a glass bottle filled with olive oil as was seen in Image A. The background in Image B focuses on ethereal effects instead of the kitchen elements present earlier.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the wooden table surface with visible grain, cracks, and natural wear present beneath the tagine and ingredients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there is a wooden surface beneath the mystical vessel and glowing orbs, it's more obscured by special effects and does not prominently feature the same detailed texture of grains, cracks, and natural wear that is visually distinct in Image A with the culinary scene.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the potted cilantro plant with bright green, leafy foliage visible in the upper right corner of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include any potted plants or culinary herbs; it instead emphasizes a mystical theme centered around the jug and glowing orbs. The upper right of the image features smoke and ethereal effects instead of greenery.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the textured, earth-toned wall in the background visible, showing subtle discoloration and uneven surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Images A and B have a textured, earth-toned wall backdrop. In Image B, despite the magical theme, the backdrop retains this texture and subtle variations of color, indicating a consistent characteristic of an uneven surface similar to the original background in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the olive oil bottle positioned slightly behind and to the left of the tagine, elevated on a small circular pedestal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the area to the left of the central focal object (the mystical jug) does not feature the originally depicted olive oil bottle on a pedestal. Instead, it showcases a transformed setting aligned with magical elements, omitting the bottle entirely.",
