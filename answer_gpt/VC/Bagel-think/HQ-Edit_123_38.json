      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a stylized, artistic background of blue ribbons and sparkles, indicative of a digital or illustrative environment. There are no components that resemble a wooden balance beam with visible wear or paint. Using world knowledge, this artistic portrayal does not replicate real-life depictions, such as a potentially worn wooden surface seen in competitive gymnastics arenas.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given the face’s anticipated position in a traditional downward gaze during a contorted handstand, we cannot analyse due to visual constraints. However, body positioning does suggest downward facing towards an implied surface.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gymnast’s hands in Image B appear positioned to support a handstand, though no concrete beam is present. Yet their execution suggests a traditional inverted stability pose.",
