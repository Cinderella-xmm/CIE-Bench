      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the woman’s face clearly visible with the same eye shape, nose, mouth, and short wavy black hair as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face of the woman in Image B is blurred, making it impossible to determine the shape of her eyes, nose, or mouth, but her hair is the same short, wavy black style. The blur prevents a clear visual comparison of facial features.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the robe maintain the red-on-right and navy-blue-on-left color division across the torso and sleeves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robe does not exhibit the same color division; it is predominantly red. In Image A, the robe is divided with red on the right and navy-blue on the left. This does not match Image B.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns with roses and vines are visible along the seams, front panel, and sleeves. This is consistent with the pattern distribution seen in Image A, where these motifs adorn similar areas.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, red paper lanterns are present at the top of the image, arranged in a decorative way, implying an indoor setting. In Image A, the red paper lanterns are visible above the market alley, glowing warmly. Image B does not show them in a market alley context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
