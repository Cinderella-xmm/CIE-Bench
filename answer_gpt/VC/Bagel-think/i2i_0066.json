      "question": "Does the image retain the English Bulldog's tan coat and white facial markings?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the English Bulldog is represented as a sculpture rather than a real dog, losing the natural coloring that a real English Bulldog possesses, such as a tan coat and white facial markings. Sculptures typically have a uniform color without realistic detailing. This transformation indicates a change from the original image's attributes.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the English Bulldog sculpture is depicted on a platform that resembles a skateboard with wheels. This suggests a balancing position similar to the original image, indicating the pose has been maintained in sculptural form.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the sculpture in what appears to be an indoor setting, with attendees in formal attire and exhibits on display. This contrasts with the outdoor grassy area and buildings seen in Image A, evidencing a change in the setting.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, what appears to be a skateboard has been translated into a sculptural form, losing the detailing and color, such as blue, present in Image A. Sculptures typically lack the original colorful design seen in real objects.",
