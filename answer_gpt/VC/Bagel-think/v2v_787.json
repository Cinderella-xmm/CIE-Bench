        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face is obscured by a blur, making it impossible to determine the shape and symmetry of the eyes. Therefore, I cannot provide an analysis based on visual information.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a chibi-style character with exaggerated features, where detailed jewelry like earrings may not be easily discernible or represented accurately. However, based on visual cues, there are no visible small gold hoop earrings on the character.",
