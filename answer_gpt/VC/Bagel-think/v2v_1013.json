      "question": "Does the sparrow retain its black bib under the chin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow shows a series of black markings under its chin, which resembles the black bib seen in sparrows. By common knowledge, sparrows are known for this distinctive feature which constitutes their black bib. Comparing this with Image A, the original, where the sparrow clearly displays a prominent black marking under the chin, both depictions retain the black bib characteristic. Thus, based on visual observation and background knowledge, the sparrow does retain its black bib.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a blue tit with bright blue and yellow plumage, which are typical of this species. The blue tit is known for these colors, and the edited image reflects that vibrancy distinctly. In comparison to Image A, which also captures the blue tit's vivid colors accurately, Image B maintains this striking coloration. Therefore, the blue tit retains its vibrant blue and yellow appearance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both birds are oriented towards each other, indicating they are facing one another. Their frontal positioning is evident in the edited depiction. Image A shows the same pose, with both birds aligned in a manner that suggests interaction or facing each other. This aspect is preserved in Image B, confirming that the birds are indeed still facing each other.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays both birds with clearly defined, dark black eyes, contributing to their expressive appearance. Birds often have prominent eyes that are stark against lighter feathers. In comparing with Image A, the original also depicts both with noticeable black eyes, emphasizing this characteristic. Therefore, both birds in the edited image retain their distinct black eyes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual representation of both birds shows their feet gripping the branch on which they are perched. This is a typical posture for sparrows and blue tits, providing stability and a natural stance. Upon comparing this with Image A, both display the birds with feet visibly clasping the branch or perch. Consequently, the birds in the edited image clearly retain their visible feet gripping the surface.",
