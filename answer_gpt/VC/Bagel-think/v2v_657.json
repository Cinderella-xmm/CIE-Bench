        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the chibi figurine is wearing a black shirt similar to the original skateboarder's attire. This is evident from the visual clues showing the black shirt on the figure in Image B. Therefore, the black shirt is retained in the edited image.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skateboard in the edited image remains as an accessory held by the chibi figurine, unlike its dynamic placement under the skateboarder's feet in the original image where the skateboarder is performing a trick. The position and function have changed in the edited image.",

This including the less detailed representation of the skateboard.",
