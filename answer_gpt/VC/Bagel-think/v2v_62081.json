      "question": "Is the portrait of the gentleman contained within an oval shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the portrait is clearly delineated by an oval boundary, which is a common shape for classical portraits. The manner in which the gentleman's representation fits within this contour confirms the use of an oval shape.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the gentleman depicted in profile, facing toward the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gentleman is depicted in profile, evidenced by the visibility of only one side of the face and head features such as the ear, indicative of a profile view typically associated with portraits of this orientation. The direction is toward the left side of the image, reinforcing the profile depiction.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a cravat tied in a bow at the neck of the gentleman?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any discernible neckwear that resembles a cravat tied in a bow. The clothing appears plain around the neck area, suggesting the absence of such an accessory.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gentleman has dark hair visible, but the sideburns or a mustache are not evident. Only the hair on the head is distinctly visible, making the presence of sideburns and a mustache unlikely.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration in Image B shows the gentleman wearing attire that appears to be a coat, as it covers the shoulders and upper portions around the back, which is typical of a coat.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the nose, jawline, and eye clearly visible on the right side of the gentleman’s face (from viewer’s perspective)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the portrait being in profile facing left, the right side of the face (from the viewer's perspective) is not as visible. Therefore, features like the nose and jawline aren't clearly distinct on that side.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the oval-shaped portrait is enclosed within border lines that form a rectangle around the oval, typical of how portraits are framed, confirming it is within a rectangular frame.",
