      "question": "Is the napkin still dark blue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the napkin appears to be dark blue, which is evident from the consistent coloration throughout the area occupied by the napkin. The shade and coloration suggest it remains the same as a standard dark blue napkin commonly used for table settings. This conclusion is based solely on the visual appearance of the napkin and common color identification knowledge.",

      "question": "Are the napkin's fabric creases and texture preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the napkin retains visible creases and texture, which are indicators of a fabric material. These details suggest the continuation of the napkin's original fabric characteristics, indicating no major alterations in its surface appearance other than the lighting adjustments to complement the spoon.",

      "question": "Does the new spoon occupy the same position on the napkin as the original fork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The position of the spoon in Image B appears to be directly centered on the napkin, maintaining the same alignment as the original fork from Image A. Both utensils are placed symmetrically along the napkin's length, suggesting the position has been preserved through the edit.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to remain a solid dark blue tone. The uniformity in color and lack of gradient or pattern indicate no change in the background's appearance aside from matching the napkinâ€™s color palette.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shadows and lighting in Image B, particularly the reflections and highlights on the spoon, appear to mimic the same lighting direction and intensity as evident with the fork in Image A. The napkin's texture and slight shadowing also correspondingly match, indicating care taken to maintain lighting consistency in the edited image.",
