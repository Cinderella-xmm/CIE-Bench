      "question": "Is the two-tiered roof with upward-curving eaves and ornamental ridge details preserved in the same structural outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roof appears to retain the two-tiered structure with traditional Japanese architectural elements, such as upward-curving eaves and ornamental ridges. The stained-glass style allows for artistic interpretation, but the core architectural features are represented. Image A also shows a two-tiered roof with the same Japanese character, confirming preservation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the large red moon positioned in the upper center of the sky and retaining its dominant red color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stained-glass depiction features a circular shape in the sky, but it is colored yellow rather than red. This is a deviation from the originality and color symbolism seen in Image A where the red moon dominates the sky. The stained-glass artist opted for brighter, possibly symbolic coloring, thus it does not match the red color and position.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there two red-colored trees symmetrically placed on the left and right sides of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see two areas filled with red stained-glass pieces representing trees flanking both sides of the building, creating the effect of symmetrical red trees. In Image A, there are two distinctly visible red maple trees enhancing symmetry; thus, the symmetry and red coloring are preserved artistically in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a reflective body of water in the foreground mirroring the building and moon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a ground component where blue and white stained-glass pieces suggest water. Despite the abstract representation, there is an attempt to mimic reflection at a basic level, though not detailed enough to mirror the moon or building exactly. Image A clearly shows a reflective water body, highlighting both elements in its surface.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there stone steps descending from the building platform toward the pond?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see an angular layout beneath the building where clear lines depict steps descending from the platform, similar to Image A where stone steps lead toward the water. The stained-glass conversion retains the orientation and presence of steps.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the windows on the building emitting a warm orange light, particularly on the upper and lower levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains large sections of yellow and orange stained-glass that fill what would be window spaces, capturing an illuminated effect as seen naturally in Image A with lit windows. Although interpretation allows color modulation, the sense of warm light through the windows remains visually clear.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there low green shrubs and manicured plants surrounding the base of the building and pond?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stained-glass representation suggests greenery with a mix of various green pieces, indicating plants around the structure. Image A exhibits well-kept green shrubs in comparable locations. While Image B's depiction is abstract, it indicates a similar arrangement of plants.",
