      "question": "Does the image retain the charred and cooked appearance of the steak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no steak or food item present. Instead, it features a mechanical elephant with individuals sitting on it. This indicates a completely different scene from Image A, which showcased a cooked steak. Thus, the image does not retain any cooked appearance related to a steak.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any broccoli florets or food items, as it displays a mechanical elephant instead. The absence of the broccoli means that we cannot assess their color or shape as was possible in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no carrot slices or any food-related objects. The scene is entirely transformed, showing a mechanical elephant, making it impossible to observe or compare anything related to carrots from Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include a steak or an arrangement of vegetables. It shows a different scenario with a mechanical elephant, so there is no arrangement similar to the original image.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The second image does not feature any tablecloth or dining scene. It depicts a mechanical elephant standing on grass, which indicates that the colorful striped tablecloth present in Image A is not retained in Image B.",
