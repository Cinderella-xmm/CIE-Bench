    "Question": "Q1: Is the number '7' clearly visible on both the front fender and side panel of the motorcycle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle is depicted with a stylized design rather than realistic details, including the absence of clear branding or numbering, such as the number '7'. The blue silhouette of a rider and motorcycle suggests a graphic representation rather than a detailed depiction with specific numbers. Therefore, there is no visible '7' on the motorcycle in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the track outline labeled '5/5' present in the upper-right corner of the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a track outline present in the upper-right corner, accompanied by the label '5/5'. This indicates a graphical feature, consistent with a stylized design that includes abstract elements like labels and outlines. Through this observation, it's confirmed that the '5/5' label is indeed present in the upper-right corner.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Does the dust trail originate directly from the rear wheel of the motorcycle?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a graphical representation of motion with a dust-like trail extending from the silhouette of the motorcycle. However, the dust trail is depicted more as an abstract extension of the design rather than realistically stemming from the rear wheel. It flows in an exaggerated circular manner without clear connection to the wheel itself, indicating a stylized depiction of motion rather than a direct origin from the rear wheel.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the rider depicted in a forward-leaning posture with hands gripping the handlebars?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle rider is illustrated as a solid blue silhouette with little detail on posture or hand placement. The abstract nature and lack of specific detail in the silhouette means there's insufficient information to suggest the rider's posture or grip on handlebars. Thus, the silhouette does not exhibit a clear forward-leaning posture or grip.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the front wheel circular with a blue rim?",
    "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the front wheel of the motorcycle silhouette is depicted as a simple circle. However, due to the graphic nature of the illustration (represented as a solid blue silhouette), distinct features like a blue rim are not present. Instead, the entire wheel shares the same monochromatic blue color as the rest of the silhouette, not explicitly highlighted.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the rider positioned in the foreground with the desert landscape behind them and the track outline in the upper-right corner?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the blue silhouette of the motorcycle with the rider is prominently placed in the foreground, with the impression of a desert landscape blended in the background. The track outline labeled '5/5' is distinctly visible in the upper-right corner. This composition aligns with the proposed question, indicating that the rider silhouette is indeed in the foreground with the desert-themed background and track outline correctly placed.",
    "answer": "Yes"
