      "question": "Is the wooden windowsill with visible grain and paneling along the lower edge present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area where the wooden windowsill is located in Image A can be observed, showing wooden texture along the windowsill. The edited image maintains these characteristics, indicating the presence of the wooden grain and paneling along the lower edge. Therefore, the visual cues combined with common sense suggest that the wooden windowsill remains present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the visual structure of the draped curtains to the left side of the window as seen in Image A. The texture, color, and positioning—sheer and white—can still be distinctly identified, demonstrating that the curtains are visible in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the window frame is visible with distinct vertical lines and clearly defined glass panes, similar to Image A. The background structure of having a window outline is preserved in the edited image, confirming its presence.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image clearly shows the blue sky with white clouds visible through the window. In Image B, just like in Image A, the window provides a view of a sky filled with fluffy clouds against a blue backdrop. This consistent imagery highlights the presence of the blue sky and white clouds.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area beneath the cat's head does not show the beige knitted blanket as seen in Image A. Instead, the cat rests on a cloud-like feature, meaning the blanket is not present and replaced by cloud-editing.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the windowsill continues to exhibit diagonal sunlight rays and corresponding shadows similar to Image A. The play of light and shadow is clearly visible, indicating the continuity of sunlight interaction.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the cat maintains its curled-up position, its head is resting on a cloud-like modification instead of the original blanket seen in Image A. Due to the alteration, the blanket is replaced in the edited image.",
