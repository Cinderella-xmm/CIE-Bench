    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image contain exactly four suitcases?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are visual cues indicating the presence of suitcases. We see one rectangular suitcase at the bottom, with a stack featuring various shapes, including a round character and two duffel bags. Counting these, we identify two upright luggage items visible in addition to the character, differing from a straightforward count of four suitcases. Therefore, the reasoning leads us to determine the count is not exactly four.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the suitcases stacked in the same order from bottom to top: two rectangular, one round, one duffel?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents an arrangement where a character is standing on a rectangular suitcase, with a small duffel bag on top of the character, making the configuration different from the specified order of two rectangular, one round, one duffel stack. A round character is present rather than a round suitcase as described.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the third suitcase from the bottom clearly round in shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the third element from the bottom is a duffel bag rather than a round suitcase. The round figure present is actually a character, serving as a visual misinterpretation for a suitcase. Consequently, the third 'luggage' item is not round.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the figure positioned to the right of the luggage stack?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, we see a figure wearing a coat standing on the right side of the luggage stack, which consists of a rectangular suitcase at the bottom with additional items stacked on top.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the figure depicted in side profile, facing left?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is displayed in a semi-side profile view that suggests a leftward orientation. This assessment is based on the position of the body and the alignment with the visible elements such as arm posture and facing direction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the suitcases rest directly on top of one another in a stable vertical stack?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, one suitcase is supporting a character and stacked elements which include a duffel bag improperly perched on this character rather than in a stable configuration directly on the suitcase. This leads to the conclusion that the stack lacks a stable direct pile.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is there exactly one human figure present in the image?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases one human-like figure standing to the right and a distinctive character with a stylized face, which does not qualify as a human figure. Therefore, the scene contains exactly one human figure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
