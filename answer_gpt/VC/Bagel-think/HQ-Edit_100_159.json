      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the player is holding a basketball. This can be determined by observing the player's grasp on the ball and the position of the ball in relation to the player's hand. The player's right arm is positioned as if in the act of dribbling or holding the basketball.",
