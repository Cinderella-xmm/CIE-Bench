      "question": "Does the boot retain the same shape and arrangement of the elongated oval cutouts on the side panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boot shows carved elongated oval shapes on the side panels, similar in number and placement to the original boot in Image A. Both images indicate a pattern where these cutouts are placed for functionality and design. The visual similarity in shape and patterning suggests retention in design from Image A to Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the eyelets positioned in the same vertical alignment and spacing as in the original boot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyelets appear in a similar vertical alignment and spacing as in Image A. Both show a sequence of eyelets that follow a pattern along the boot's upper section, maintaining uniform intervals. The consistency in visual structure and arrangement infers a retained alignment and spacing from the original.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the outsole retain the exact tread pattern and groove depth as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outsole is carved with a design that appears to mimic the tread pattern of the original in Image A, though Image B shows a wooden boot which may alter perception of groove depth. However, the visual representation aims to replicate the pattern structure of deep grooves typical of hiking boots.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the toe cap present and shaped identically to the original, including its rounded front and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a carved segment on the boot that mirrors the rounded shape and position of the toe cap found on the boot in Image A. Despite the material difference, the essential shape and placement relative to the boot remains consistent.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the padded collar at the top of the boot preserved in shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boot in Image B reflects a simplified version of the padded collar due to the wooden carving, yet retains a bulge at the top that signifies where padding would be. This position aligns with the original in Image A, implying consistency in positioning and general shape retention.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the boot positioned in the same side profile with the same forward tilt as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination of Image B, the boot presents a side profile similar to that in Image A, with both images showing the boot tilted towards the viewer's left, signifying a retained consistent posture.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tongue is discernible and appears to follow the shape and positioning typical of boots seen in Image A. Its rise from the boot opening signifies an attempt to replicate the prominence and typical positioning found in standard boot designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boot in Image B portrays a segment at the back resembling the heel counter of a boot, maintaining the contour similar to that in Image A, which confirms a preserved shape and presence relative to the original.",
