      "question": "Are the surfboards still predominantly yellow and cream in color with their original shape intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfboards held by the individuals appear unchanged in color and shape compared to Image A. Both surfboards retain their yellow and cream hues and their elongated shapes, indicative of standard surfboard designs expected at a beach setting. This observation is consistent with what is seen in Image A, implying that no alterations were made to their coloration or structural shape.",

      "question": "Do the rolling waves and ocean details remain consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases an ocean with waves that continue to roll towards the shore, just as depicted in Image A. The representation of the sea and waves captures a natural beach setting, maintaining the rhythmic motion and shades of blue seen in the original. This consistency indicates no changes were made to the oceanic elements in the edited image.",

      "question": "Have the individuals maintained their relaxed yet anticipatory postures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The individuals in Image B are still captured with a similar stance as in Image A, standing with surfboards under arm while facing the ocean. The body language, including relaxed shoulders and a forward gaze towards the sea, reflects anticipation and is unchanged between the two images, suggesting their postures are consistently maintained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the sandy beach keeps its natural brown hue and continues to show clear footprints, much like in Image A. These elements contribute to the realism of a typical beach environment, and no changes appear to have been made to the sand's color or the presence of footprints between the images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B stays consistent with Image A in terms of sky conditions. Both images depict a clear blue sky without noticeable cloud coverage, emphasizing a bright, sunny day typical for a beach setting. This suggests that no alterations were made to the sky between the original and edited images.",
