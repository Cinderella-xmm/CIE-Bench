    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the moss-covered rock formations along the stream clearly visible and preserved in their original positions and shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rock formations are present but visually altered due to the fantastical and ethereal aesthetic with glowing mushrooms and fairies. Their shapes and positions seem to deviate from a natural setting, suggesting a redesign compared to the original Image A, which portrays a realistic scene. The focus in Image B is more on the glowing elements rather than preserving the natural details of the moss-covered rocks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the mossy boulders arranged in the same sequence along the stream as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sequence of elements in the landscape, including boulders and the stream path, is less pronounced and subtly altered due to the introduction of fantasy elements such as fairies and glowing mushrooms. This change indicates that they are not arranged in the same sequence as the original image, which has a clearer natural sequence of boulders.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the pink flowers located in the lower right corner of the image present and unchanged in color and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When observing Image B, the pink flowers are visible in the lower corners. They maintain their color, appearing in an area consistent with their position in the original image. The aesthetic aligns closely with the fantasy theme and bright lighting of the image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the light beams enter from the top center and spread downward in the same diagonal pattern as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is more uniform and ethereal, focusing on the glow from the mushrooms and fairies, with less emphasis on natural light beams. While there is a directional flow, it is not in the same diagonal pattern as seen in Image A, which showcases naturalistic sun rays penetrating the forest canopy.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there hanging vines extending from the upper branches of trees, particularly near the central canopy area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of hanging vines is not apparent as the image shifts towards a more mystical, enchanted forest appearance. The focus is on the larger trunks and the magical, glowing aesthetic rather than detailing vines, which are prominent in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the stream follow the same curved path with multiple small waterfalls over mossy rocks as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stream in Image B appears to have a magical or surreal quality without the distinct curved path and waterfall details as depicted in the realistic setting of Image A. This suggests a stylized interpretation rather than adherence to the natural state seen previously.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the green moss texture consistently applied to tree trunks and ground surfaces in the same way as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the emphasis is more on fantastical elements like glowing organisms, and the moss texture seems to be less consistent or subdued, differing from the lush vividness and texture distribution seen in the natural portrayal of Image A. The trees in Image B are depicted with a smooth and ethereal quality rather than the textured, moss-covered look.",
