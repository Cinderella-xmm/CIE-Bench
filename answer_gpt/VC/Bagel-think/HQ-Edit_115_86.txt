    "Question": "Q1: Are the pointe shoes visible and correctly positioned on the ballerina’s feet, with ribbons wrapped around the ankles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ballerina's feet are depicted with ballet flats or shoes rather than pointe shoes. The illustration shows simplified footwear with a uniform color without ribbons around the ankles. Using world knowledge, a typical ballet pointe shoe is designed to extend the dancer’s line and usually includes crisscrossed ribbons securing the shoe to the foot. Image A confirms the presence of properly positioned pointe shoes, characterized by ribbons wrapped around her ankles.",

This is a classic hairstyle for dancers for maintaining a polished look. Comparing with Image A, the dancer has her hair pulled back into a bun, but does not feature straight bangs.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the ballerina standing en pointe with one leg slightly behind and bent, and the other leg supporting her weight in a balanced position?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer stands with one leg slightly raised but flat on the surface, indicating she is not en pointe.

    "Question": "Q5: Is the ballerina standing on a wooden floor composed of horizontal planks with visible grain and warm brown tones?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, examining the environment indicates there is no depiction of a wooden floor like in Image A. Instead, a colorful abstract background is portrayed, void of specific flooring elements seen in Image A, which features a wooden floor with distinct grain details.",

    "Question": "Q6: Is the ballerina’s head tilted upward and turned toward the right side of the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the head of the ballerina is slightly turned to the right, aligning with the tilt toward upward motion but largely forward-facing when combined with her posture. Image A similarly portrays the head turned toward the right with nuance in its upwards tilt. Thus the image largely suggests a sideways turn.",
    "answer": "No"
