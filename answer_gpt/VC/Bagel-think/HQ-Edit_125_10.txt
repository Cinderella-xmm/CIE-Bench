    "Question": "Q4: Are there multiple oars extending outward from the hull, each connected to a small human-like figure representing a rower?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, several oars extend outward from the ship's hull, but they do not appear directly connected to human-like figures as rowers inside the ship. Instead, an army of toy or miniature warriors is shown at the front, unrelated to the oar positions. Given the absence of the described rower-and-oar connection, this depiction negates the question's scenario.",
