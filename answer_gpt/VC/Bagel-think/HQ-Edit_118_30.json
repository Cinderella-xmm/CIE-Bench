      "question": "Is the number \"1902\" clearly visible on the front of the locomotive?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the locomotive displays the number 'R112' on the front instead of '1902'. This is a crucial detail on the locomotive's face, and it directly answers the question according to the visual cue in the image. Hence, the number '1902' is not visible in Image B.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the locomotive retain a dominant green color on its body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the locomotive is illustrated with vibrant colors including orange, blue, yellow, and red. Green, which is a dominant hue in Image A, is not prominently retained, suggesting a contrast in color palette between the two images.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the station building constructed from stone material with visible texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting is stylized into puzzle pieces; there is no representation of a stone station building with texture as seen in Image A. This transformation into a colorful puzzle implies a change in material and style.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows no depiction of a station building with moss on the roof. It features a colorful puzzle rendering that omits such details present in Image A. Moss or detailed texture is not discernible on any roof structure in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict passengers or luggage trunks as present in Image A. The edited image transforms the scene into a puzzle format that lacks these specific elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show wind turbines; instead, the background is a colorful puzzle. Wind turbines, which are present in Image A, are absent in the edited version, marking a significant change in background scenery.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the railway track is depicted as curved, extending towards the distance, which mimics the version in Image A. The visual cue in the edited image clearly shows curvature.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not showcase wooden benches or seated passengers, replacing them with a colorful puzzle concept. The edited image lacks these elements that appear in the original Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks figures or platform details. The original figurative elements from Image A, such as early 20th-century fashion, are transformed into an abstract puzzle in Image B, removing clothing context.",
