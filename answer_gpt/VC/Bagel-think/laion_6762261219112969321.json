      "question": "Are there two separate, cushioned backrest sections positioned side by side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible sofa at all. Instead, the image shows a cartoon-like abstract creature made of spheres resembling clouds. Based on this visual cue, there is no indication of any sofa or its components such as cushioned backrest sections. World knowledge about sofas and backrests supports that they are typically rectangular and identifiable in images of furniture, which are not present here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there two armrests, one on each side of the sofa, aligned with the seat cushions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a whimsical cloud-like character made up of spherical shapes. There is no depiction of a sofa, hence no armrests or seat cushions can be identified. Armrests would usually be visibly distinct and positioned parallel to seat cushions in a typical sofa image, neither of which is present in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sofa have four legs, one at each corner of the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cloud-like animation made of spheres, without any recognizable furniture structure such as a sofa or legs. Common understanding of sofas suggests they have legs for support, usually found at corners. The lack of a furniture base in the image indicates there are no legs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sofa symmetrically arranged along a vertical centerline, with identical features on the left and right sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an abstract, cloud-based character with a non-symmetrical shape. There is no sofa or design pattern that suggests symmetry found in typical furniture pieces. The elements presented do not possess symmetrical features akin to sofas, thus indicating a lack of symmetry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the seat cushions positioned directly beneath the backrest cushions, forming a continuous seating surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not have a seating surface or recognizable cushions related to sofa design. Instead, it features an abstract character comprised of spherical shapes. This lacks any form indicative of a continuous seating area with positioned seat cushions, which sofas commonly have.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there small black circular fasteners visible on the wooden frame, particularly near the armrest joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual depiction is of an animated cloud-like character without any wooden frame components or fasteners. A wooden frame and visible fasteners are typical elements in furniture design, which are not evident in this unconventional, spherical cloud arrangement.",
