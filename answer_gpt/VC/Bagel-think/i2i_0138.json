      "question": "Are the silver blades still visibly reflective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blades appear as a stylized illustration with dark outlines, lacking realistic light reflection characteristics. The absence of light and shadow details typical of reflective surfaces suggests that the surface is not visibly reflective in this edited version. In contrast, Image A shows real-world reflective properties with light highlights visible on the blades, indicating that they are reflective. Therefore, the edited image loses these reflection cues.",

      "question": "Do the golden handles still show a polished finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the handles with a stylized look featuring dark outlines, without any highlights or reflections typical of polished metal surfaces. Unlike Image A, where the golden handles exhibit highlights and gloss due to light reflection, Image B lacks these aspects, indicating the polished finish is not visually represented in the edited version.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the open V-shape configuration of the blades preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image in Image B maintains the overall structure and orientation of the scissors. Despite being a stylized representation, the open V-shape is clearly visible and consistent with Image A's configuration, which also displays the scissors in an open V-shape. The absence of changes to the structure and orientation indicates the configuration is preserved.",

      "question": "Is the background still a uniform dark gray?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is transformed into a white space with some textured elements following the stylized drawing of the scissors. This contrasts with the uniform dark gray background in Image A, which provides a flat, consistent color without variations. The transformation in Image B clearly indicates the background is no longer the same uniform dark gray.",

      "question": "Are the edges of the blades still clean and sharp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, being a stylized version, maintains clear outlines of the blades, suggesting sharpness in terms of shape representation. However, the artistic style focuses on outlines rather than realistic sharpness or precision. In Image A, the blades exhibit real-world precision and clarity indicative of sharpness. Despite the change in artistic interpretation, the edges appear clean within the stylized representation in Image B.",
