      "question": "Is the truck still predominantly red in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which appears to be an illustration or stylized version of a truck, the predominant color of the truck's body is red. This includes the main body up to the cab. In the original real-world Image A, the truck is also red, which aligns with the traditionally bright red color used for such vehicles. Therefore, the primary color has been preserved in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the large chrome exhaust pipe still present on the side of the truck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized depiction of the truck includes details that resemble chrome exhaust pipes positioned vertically on the side of the cab. In Image A, these chrome pipes are prominent and characteristic of large trucks, often used to depict their robust design and function. Thus, the presence of similar elements in the artistic version suggests they remain present.",

      "question": "Are the wheels correctly positioned on the truck, including their size and visible lug nuts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stylized depiction of the truck's wheels. The wheels are in the expected positions for a truck, on each side underneath, and they are rounded, of appropriate size relative to the body. The design includes simple lug nuts, common in illustrated forms for clarity. When comparing to Image A, these wheels match in position and relative size, though probably lacking intricate realism due to the illustration style.",

      "question": "Does the truck's front grille maintain its vertical slats and the emblem in the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck features a front grille with vertical slats and an emblem at the top center. Image A similarly exhibits a vertical slat design and a central emblem. This consistency in grille design is common in stylizing vehicles for accurate yet simplistic recognition and has been maintained from A to B.",

      "question": "Are the large windows on the truck's cab and the chrome side mirror still visible and in place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the large windows on the truck's cab are visible, along with design elements resembling mirrors. These aspects mirror Image A's real-world counterpart, which has significant cab windows and noticeable side mirrors for broader visibility, which are crucial for driving safety and common in both realistic and simplified portrayals.",
