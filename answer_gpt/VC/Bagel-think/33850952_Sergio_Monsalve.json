      "question": "Are there at least eight distinct horizontal levels stacked vertically along the building facade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the architectural design of the building features distinct horizontal segments or levels. By counting these visible levels, we can determine that there are at least eight horizontal levels stacked vertically. The segmentation is marked by the consistent outline and shadow, representing separate floors or tiers.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a transparent railing structure visible on each balcony, positioned directly outside the windows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a series of balconies integrated into the building's design, characterized by transparent or glass railing structures which are positioned directly outside the windows. The transparency allows visibility through the railing, which is typical of modern architectural designs for safety while maintaining visual openness.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the windows on each floor arranged in a continuous, curved arc along the buildingâ€™s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The windows in Image B are arranged in a continuous, wavy pattern that follows the contour of the building, creating arcs that move vertically upwards. This seamless curvature is emphasized by the design and edits, which highlight the windows' alignment along the facade's flowing lines.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Can furniture items (such as chairs or tables) be seen inside the rooms through the windows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the visual enhancements to the building's structure, the areas immediately behind windows do not display any interior details clearly. There is no evidence of furniture items such as chairs or tables visible through the windows, possibly due to the colored lighting and reflections.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the building viewed from a low-angle side perspective, showing its height and curving profile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The photograph in Image B is taken from a perspective that suggests a side view of the building, capturing its substantial height and distinctive curving or wavy profile. This low-angle view accentuates the architectural style, emphasizing the building's verticality and complex design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does each window have a corresponding balcony immediately outside it, aligned horizontally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each level of the building showcases horizontal alignment, where balconies are positioned immediately outside the windows, consistent with contemporary urban design. This alignment is evident in the edited image, where design elements and lighting highlight the proximity and horizontal linkage between the balconies and windows.",
