      "question": "Is the woman depicted in a three-quarter pose, leaning on the column with her head turned toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman does not show any signs of a three-quarter pose aimed towards the viewer. Her body faces forward while leaning on the column, and her head also seems to be forward rather than turned distinctly toward the viewer. The lack of definitive head turning suggests a straightforward position. Thus, based on the visual cues combined with my understanding of poses, I conclude she is not in a three-quarter pose head turned towards the viewer.",
