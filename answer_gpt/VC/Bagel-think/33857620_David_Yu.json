      "question": "Is the white-framed window visible on the front face of the transformed structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main chalet structure visible in Image A has been replaced by a large, luminous creature with intricate designs, similar to a mythical or fantasy creature. There is no visible structure with a white-framed window in Image B, as the chalet has been completely transformed into this creature. Therefore, the visual cues and common knowledge about windows and structures confirm that no white-framed window is visible on the creature.",

      "question": "Is the small red structure located to the left of the main chalet still present in the transformed scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, there is a small red structure near the main chalet. In Image B, the creature is located in the foreground, but the background remains unchanged, including the presence of the small red structure to the left. The consistent location and size of the small red structure compared to Image A supports the answer.",

      "question": "Does the waterway flow from the bottom-right corner toward the center-left of the image, maintaining its original course?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The waterway in Image A flows from the bottom-right toward the center-left. In Image B, despite the addition of the fantastical creature, the waterway's path is unchanged. It still runs in the same direction relative to the image's orientation, which can be deduced by the unchanged positions of the stream and surrounding rocks.",

      "question": "Is the large patch of snow located directly in front of the chalet still visible and positioned in the same place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, there is a large patch of snow in front of the chalet. In Image B, although the chalet is transformed, the patch of snow is still visible and occupies the same position relative to the landscape. The unchanged elements in the background ensure the snow patch's consistency.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are moss-covered rocks visible along the edges of the stream in the transformed scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the stream is bordered by moss-covered rocks, a feature often present in natural streams. Image B retains the natural landscape elements, including the stream with its moss-covered rocks. The unchanged natural features imply that the rocks remain visible along the stream's edges.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the transformed structure located in the mid-ground, slightly to the right of the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fantastical creature, which replaced the chalet, is positioned in the image's mid-ground, slightly right of the center. This location is consistent with the chalet's original positioning in Image A. The creature's bright presence might make it seem more prominent, but its position within the image context matches the chalet's former location.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the mountains in the background remain visible, characterized by snow patches and mist shrouding their peaks. The consistent portrayal of the mountains with snow and mist across both images supports the visual continuity of the scene.",
