      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the van in an isometric perspective, where it is shown from a slightly angled top-down view. Such a perspective is often used to create a three-dimensional effect on a two-dimensional surface. This analysis stems from evaluating the angles and visibility of different parts of the van.",
