    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the specific black spots and white markings on the butterfly's wings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is depicted using a pixelated, low-resolution style which simplifies and abstracts its wing patterns. This style lacks the capacity to accurately capture specific black spots and white markings like those prominently seen in Image A, where these details are sharp and distinct. Due to the blocky and generalized representation in Image B, these specific wing details are not retained.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the edited image retain the fuzzy texture of the butterfly's body?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the butterfly with a pixelated, flat appearance that lacks any texture detail. Whereas Image A shows a distinct fuzzy texture on the butterfly's body due to its high resolution and detailed depiction, Image B's stylized, pixelated format does not allow for such fine texture detail to be preserved.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the butterfly still positioned on the wooden surface in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible background or context suggesting a wooden surface. The focus is solely on an isolated representation of a butterfly, rendered in a pixelated style without any indication of external positioning or surface. Comparing this to Image A, where the butterfly is clearly on a wooden surface, it's evident that Image B does not retain the same positioning context.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the edited image retain the detailed texture of the butterfly's wings?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents the butterfly in a stylized manner with large, pixelated blocks, which inherently removes detailed textures present in Image A. Image A showcases high-definition textures with intricate patterns on the wings, which cannot be achieved in the pixelated form of Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the edited image retain the specific arrangement of spots on the butterfly's wings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pixelated representation of the butterfly generalizes the wing patterns into broad color blocks without distinct spot arrangements. Unlike Image A, which clearly displays a specific and detailed arrangement of spots, the edited image does not preserve these specific arrangements, tending instead towards a more abstract form.",
    "answer": "No"
