    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the owl perched on a moss-covered branch with visible green moss texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl is perched on a branch that appears stylized, though the texture and green color of the moss-covered surface indicate artistic representation of moss. This suggests that the overall theme of the owl on a moss-covered branch is maintained, despite the alterations.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a small green plant with slender leaves growing next to the owl’s left side on the branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, close inspection reveals the presence of a stylized green plant next to the owl’s left side, bearing slender leaf-like structures. The artistic design does not completely obscure the characteristic shape and positioning of a small plant.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background composed of dark, out-of-focus green foliage typical of a forest environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background maintains a dark, out-of-focus appearance with a greenish hue, resembling the foliage common in forest environments, even though it appears more surreal due to the edits.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the owl facing directly toward the camera with a slight head tilt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl has been artistically modified to possess stylized features; however, it faces directly toward the viewer with its head slightly tilted, which mirrors a common owl posture, indicating maintained orientation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the branch have a rough, textured surface covered in green moss with visible patches and crevices?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the branch appears stylized, but the artistry retains the representation of textured surfaces with what resembles green moss. This indicates that, while altered, the visual suggestion of a moss-covered, textured branch remains.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the lighting dim and natural, with subtle highlights on the owl’s feathers and eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears more ethereal and artificial rather than natural, with glowing effects and illuminated elements. The traditional dim and subtle natural highlights in feathers are replaced by creative lighting effects.",
