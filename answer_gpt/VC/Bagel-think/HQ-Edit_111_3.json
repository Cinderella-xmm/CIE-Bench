      "question": "Does the butterfly retain its original iridescent electric blue wing color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's wings display a vibrant shade of electric blue. This color is bright and standout, known for its visually striking appearance. Combining world knowledge, electric blue is a term for a vivid and intense blue similar to the appearance of the butterfly's wings in this context. Thus, the butterfly retains its iridescent blue color from Image A.",

      "question": "Are the dark black edges along the outer margins of the butterflyâ€™s wings preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings in Image B have distinct dark black edges along the outer margins. This is a common characteristic of many butterflies, providing contrast to highlight the vivid blue of the wings. By observing the same feature in Image A, a direct preservation of this characteristic can be confirmed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is shown with both wings spread wide and symmetrically, which is a typical posture for butterflies when resting or showcasing their wing patterns. Such symmetrical extension is also observed in the original Image A, proving no change in this aspect.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a bright pink cosmos flower situated directly beneath the butterfly. This flower, which corresponds to the one visible in Image A, is prominent and forms an integral part of the composition. The edited annotations in Image B do not obscure this flower, ensuring its visibility.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and B, the pink flower under the butterfly is shown with yellow stamens in its center. These stamens are identifiable due to their color contrast against the pink petals. The feature is clearly preserved in Image B despite the added text overlay elsewhere.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no sign of physical contact between the butterfly and the surface of the pink flower seen beneath it. Visual cues indicate the butterfly is hovering above the flower, as is also noticeable in Image A. Thus, the positioning remains consistent across both images.",
