      "question": "Is there a bench positioned on the left side of the porch, facing inward toward the cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the abstract and stylized nature of the artwork makes it difficult to identify specific objects such as a bench with certainty. A bench typically appears as a horizontal structure supported by legs, often used for seating. Due to the use of geometric shapes and abstract forms, it is impossible to confidently identify a bench positioned on the left side of the porch. This renders any assumptions on this matter speculative.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a large vertical glass panel or sliding door on the front face of the cabin, emitting warm light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents an abstract depiction where forms and shapes do not clearly represent typical architectural features like a glass panel or sliding door. While certain sections of the image might suggest divisions similar to window panes, they lack clarity and detail needed to confirm the presence of a glass panel emitting warm light, which is characteristic of a literal depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a bright circular moon located in the upper right portion of the sky, above the distant hills?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The artwork in Image B displays a circular element in the upper right area that could symbolize the moon or sun. Given the stylization, it is brightly depicted and occupies a position consistent with a celestial body. However, due to the artistic style, we can't definitively conclude if it represents a night scene with a moon.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there vertical wooden support beams forming the porch structure directly in front of the cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the use of bold vertical and horizontal lines suggests structures resembling support beams. These geometric shapes are arranged in a way that aligns with the concept of a porch structure with support beams. Despite the abstraction, these forms are indicative of beams.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there visible warm interior lighting emanating from within the cabin through the glass wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The abstract and geometric style of Image B does not reveal distinct lighting effects. Warm interior lighting typically results in a glow or a distinct warm hue emanating from within the structure; however, the color palette and shapes in Image B don't suggest any emanation of warm light through what would be a glass wall.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lower right foreground of Image B consists of abstract forms without discernible detail that could specifically identify flowering plants or white blossoms. The lack of clear representations of plants makes it impossible to affirm the presence of such details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the representation of the background is abstract and does not present clear silhouettes indicative of hills or mountains as seen in typical landscapes. The abstract depiction lacks definitive shapes that would characterize such geographical features.",
