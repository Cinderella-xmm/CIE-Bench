      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, five ducklings are shown swimming on the surface of the water within the glass ball. Each duckling has its body partially submerged and its head above the water, indicating that they are swimming. These details are clearly visible upon careful inspection of the edited image.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a glass ball with figurines where smooth stones are located around the rim of the glass, mimicking the appearance of being partially submerged, indicating it may be an artistic representation or model. The water surface in the main scene does not allow visibility beneath the water surface, unlike Image A.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene inside the glass ball prominently features reflections on the water's surface. These reflections include the evergreen trees, which are shown both on the border of the glass ball's inner image and on the water surface itself, thus maintaining coherency and visibility.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image within the glass ball portrays a scene with densely packed evergreen trees on both sides of the water, implying a corridor-like arrangement in the artistic representation within the glass ball. This aligns with typical natural scenes where trees surround bodies of water.",
