      "question": "Is the bird rendered in a vibrant yellow color matching the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is depicted in a vibrant yellow color. This is evident from the entirety of its body, which is uniformly colored in yellow without any shading or variation. In comparison, Image A also presents the bird in yellow, albeit with more realistic shading and depth to highlight feathers' texture. Thus, the color is consistent in both images, although Image B lacks the realistic details seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Are there distinct black stripes visible on the bird’s wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible black stripes on the bird's wings, a few arcs under the wings that suggest feather lines. These are basic and flat compared to more detailed patterns in realistic depictions. Image A contains intricate feather details with clear black markings, though stylized in Image B, the black stripes remain a recognizable attribute.",

      "question": "Does the bird have a clearly defined round black eye?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bird in Image B features a round black eye that is simple in design. This is consistent with the style employed throughout Image B, where simplicity in features is preferred. Image A also shows a round black eye, but with more detail and depth, adding realism to the feature. Therefore, both images show a round black eye, appropriately matched to their respective styles.",

      "question": "Are the cherry blossoms depicted with five rounded petals and a pale pink color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Cherry blossoms in Image B have five petals, presented in a pale pink hue. This simplified yet effective illustration captures the essence of cherry blossoms found in nature. In Image A, the blossoms are more detailed with realistic textures and subtle color gradients. The fundamental characteristics of the cherry blossoms are consistent across both images despite the artistic style differences.",

      "question": "Are the bird’s feet orange-yellow in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bird's feet in Image B are rendered in a dark tone, different from the orange-yellow color seen in typical depictions of bird feet. In Image A, the feet are clearly an orange-yellow shade, providing contrast against the branch and complementing the bird's yellow body. Image B diverges by using brownish-black, possibly for stylistic simplicity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the bird’s feet positioned as if gripping a branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird’s feet are positioned to appear as if gripping the branch. Although the depiction is stylized, the arrangement of the feet follows common patterns seen in bird illustrations where birds are perched. Image A displays a natural, dynamic grip that helps in reinforcing realism, whereas Image B uses a basic, simplified grip pattern.",
