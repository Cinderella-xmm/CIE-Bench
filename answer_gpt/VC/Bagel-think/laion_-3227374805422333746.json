      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the three-section gabled roof structure is visible, with a central tower prominently surrounded by two lower side wings. This architectural structure remains consistent with Image A, indicating no changes in this aspect. The consistency between two images confirms the original structure is retained.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden barrel is situated on the ground beside the right arched doorway, which differs from any notion of it being 'hanging from a bracket'. Clarifying this, Image A depicts the barrel in the same ground location. Both images show no change in its placement, countering the premise of 'hanging'.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two arched doorways in their original positions on the ground floor, one appearing open and the other closed, retaining the same shapes and positions as in Image A. Thus, the doorways are unchanged in structure or layout.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there is an extension of greenery across the roof and floor elements, individual small green potted plants are not distinctly visible as compared to Image A where plants can be viewed adjunct to the walls.
