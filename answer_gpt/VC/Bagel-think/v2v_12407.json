      "question": "Is the mango depicted with an oval shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object presumed to be a mango has a distinctly pixelated and rectangular drawing, with angular shapes that do not resemble an oval. Commonly, a mango is recognized by its smooth and oval structure. However, the pixel art style of Image B disrupts this natural shape, preventing accurate identification of an oval form.",

      "question": "Is there a small stem visible at the top of the mango?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the top of the depicted fruit, there is a small extension or protrusion that resembles a stem drawn in pixel art style. Though it is crudely outlined with thick black lines, typical of pixel art, based on its positioning it can be inferred as representing a stem.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the paper towel folded into a cradle-like shape beneath the mango?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beneath the pixelated mango, the depiction of a blue and white object suggests the representation of a paper towel formed in a supporting structure, akin to a cradle. The depiction involves exaggerated outlines and stylization due to the pixel art aesthetics, which aligns with the intention to display a cradle-like shape.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there four clearly defined flaps extending from the paper towel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue and white pixelated representation beneath the fruit has several protruding sections, likely intended to be flaps of a paper towel; however, the artwork's style and granularity cause a less precise depiction and not as clearly defined as in realistic art. Despite the stylization, there are distinct segments that can be interpreted as multiple flaps.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the mango positioned in the center of the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the fruit approximately in the middle of the visual space available on the table, echoing a central placement. This positioning is typical for emphasis in still lifes, notably when using such bold and contrasted colors found in pixel art.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the table show a horizontal wood grain pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the surface upon which the fruit is placed is covered in a bold orange and deep red pattern, which does not specifically mimic the realistic grainy texture of wood. Instead, it is stylized heavily into a pixel art format, resulting in a non-standard representation that lacks true-to-life horizontal wood grain dynamics.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question": "Is a wooden chair partially visible behind the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, behind the pixelated table, thereâ€™s a red structure that could be interpreted as the back of a chair, drawn using thick pixel strokes. Its angular design and positioning suggest a chair's presence, albeit abstracted, which matches common object positioning relative to tables.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is there a diagonal shadow cast by the mango onto the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadowing are not as detailed, with much of the surrounding area depicted in bold hues and minimal shadow representation. Any form of shadow that might be present lacks the characteristic subtlety and direction expected of a realistic diagonal shadow, notably absent under these artistic constraints.",
