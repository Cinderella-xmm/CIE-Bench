      "question": "Does the edited image retain the intricate wrought-iron lattice structure of both Eiffel Towers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Towers are miniature replicas contained within a snow globe. Their appearance is designed to mimic the well-known intricate lattice structure, although simplified due to the smaller scale. This lattice design is a key feature of the Eiffel Tower's architectural style, commonly recognized worldwide. Thus, the edited image does retain the lattice structure characteristic of Eiffel Towers, even in a miniaturized form.",

      "question": "Are both towers supported by a triangular base composed of four distinct pillars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, each tower within the snow globe appears to have a simplified base structure. Given the reduced size of the replicas, the bases do not visibly display a detailed triangular form composed of four distinct pillars as in the original Eiffel Tower design. The miniature versions seem more compact and lack the detailed base that would show the clear separation of four distinct supporting pillars.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a clearly defined archway beneath each tower through which the path passes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, depicting the towers in a snow globe, there are simplified archways visible beneath each of the tower models. The path underneath them is suggested by the layout within the confines of the globe, simulating the passageways known to exist under full-sized Eiffel Towers where paths typically pass.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there exactly two Eiffel Towers present in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B indeed displays two miniature Eiffel Towers within the snow globe. This is visually clear as both towers are positioned side by side within the confined setting of the snow globe, replicating the iconic structure known around the world.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does each tower have a pointed spire at its apex?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, both towers feature a design that includes a pointed spire at the top, akin to the actual Eiffel Tower design. These spires are part of the recognizable silhouette of the Eiffel Tower and logically are retained even in miniature replicas for authenticity.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there three distinct horizontal platform levels visible along the height of each tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image B, we see the miniaturized towers within the snow globe do not distinctly exhibit the three horizontal platform levels that the real Eiffel Tower has. The miniaturization and artistic simplification necessary to fit within the snow globe do not allow the inclusion of this detail prominently.",
