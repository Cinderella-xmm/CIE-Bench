    "Question": "Q1: Is the four-legged base of the Eiffel Tower with a central archway present and clearly visible?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a large futuristic figure is integrated into the structure of the Eiffel Tower, obscuring the actual four-legged base and central archway characteristic of the tower. The futuristic figure forms the new central structure, which covers the original design. Therefore, the typical four-legged base with a central archway is not clearly visible in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the classical-style building visible through the central arch of the tower?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, despite the futuristic figure overlaying the Eiffel Tower, you can still see through the bottom part of the figure, similar to looking through the original archway. The classical-style building that exists in the background is visible through the opening under the futuristic figure's structure, maintaining visibility similar to Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are there people visible sitting or walking on the grassy field in front of the tower?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are still visible people scattered across the grassy field, sitting or lying down, much like in Image A. The activities and presence of people in front of the new central structure mirror the original scene.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the sky gradient transitioning from deep blue at the top to orange near the horizon present?",
    "explanation": "Image B retains the same sky gradient as seen in Image A, transitioning from a deep blue at the top to an orange hue near the horizon. Despite the changes to the tower structure, the background sky remains unaffected.",
