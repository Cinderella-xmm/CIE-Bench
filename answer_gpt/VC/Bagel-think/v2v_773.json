      "question": "Is there a single dark brown seed visible in the center of the apple's cross-section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, when examining the apple's cross-section, there is a central opening with a single dark brown object which resembles a seed. This is typically the appearance observed when apples are sliced vertically, and seeds are housed in the core. Given this observation, it fits the common characteristic of an apple seed.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the apple’s flesh show a dry, fibrous texture with visible vein-like patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flesh of the apple in Image B appears to have a dry and fibrous look. The texture is enhanced by the visible vein-like patterns running through it, which are common in apples that have been cut and allowed to slightly dry out. These patterns suggest dehydration and aging of the fruit’s flesh.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a dark brown stem attached to the top of the apple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apple has a clearly visible stem protruding from the top. The stem is dark brown in color, which is typical of apple stems as they dry after being picked. This is consistent with how apple stems are attached to the top of the fruit.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the apple sliced vertically, exposing a symmetrical cross-section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the apple is sliced from top to bottom, exposing its interior. The cut reveals a symmetrical cross-section, which is characteristic of vertical slicing. This symmetrical view shows the core, seeds, and the layout of the flesh clearly.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the apple placed on a flat, light gray, matte surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apple is indeed sitting on a surface that appears to be flat, light gray, and matte. The distinction is visible in contrast with the other objects in the image which suggests that the base has a consistent color and texture, indicative of a matte finish.",
