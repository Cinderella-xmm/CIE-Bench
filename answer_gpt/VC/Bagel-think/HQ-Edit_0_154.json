      "question": "Is the U.S. $20 bill with its distinctive green color, \"20\" numeral, and architectural design visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are various graphic elements and colors that do not resemble traditional banknotes. There is no clear presence of architectural design or a numeral '20' that typically characterizes a U.S. $20 bill. Thus, based on the visual cues, the U.S. $20 bill is not visible in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the Qatari Riyal note with its pink-orange hue, Arabic script, and serial number \"103 01\" present and recognizable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B consists of stylized graphics and symbols, with none of the elements exhibiting a pink-orange hue, Arabic script, or any serial number linked to a Qatari Riyal. These specific features are not identifiable in Image B, indicating that the Qatari Riyal note is not present.",

      "question": "Is the Indian Rupee 50 note with the lion capital symbol and yellow-brown color clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, the dominant features are abstract symbols and graphics, lacking the lion capital or the distinct yellow-brown color of the Indian Rupee 50 note. These identifiers are absent, proving that the note is not clearly visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the U.S. $1 bill with the portrait of George Washington and \"ONE DOLLAR\" text present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elements in Image B include various lines, symbols, and abstract designs without any recognizable portrait of George Washington or the 'ONE DOLLAR' text, which are fundamental elements of the U.S. $1 bill. Therefore, the U.S. $1 bill is not present in the edited image.",

      "question": "Are all four banknotes (U.S. $20, Qatari Riyal, Indian Rupee 50, U.S. $1) present together in the same visual space?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays crafted symbols, graphics, and flags with no specific indication of any of the four banknotes being present. The absence of recognizable features of these notes means that none of them appear together or separately in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B comprises a color palette that does not preserve the original green, pink-orange, or yellow-brown hues associated with the U.S. dollar, Qatari Riyal, or Indian Rupee, respectively. The colors used seem more generic and do not correspond to the traditional banknote colors.",
