      "question": "Is the central archway positioned at the center of the main structure, forming a passageway between the two vertical pillars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central archway appears to be located at the center of a prominent structure featuring large vertical pillars. This archway design, often found in historical architecture such as castles or fortifications, visually creates a passageway through the structure. The visual analysis positions the arch centrally between vertical elements, suggesting a traditional gateway design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the two vertical pillars standing symmetrically on either side of the central archway, forming a tall, narrow gateway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two tall vertical pillars flanking a central archway. Such a configuration, with balanced elements on each side of the arch, implies symmetry, a common architectural trait for gateways that creates strength and visual balance. The presence of the two pillars alongside the archway suggests they are part of a cohesive design, forming a symmetrical gateway.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the battlements along the top of the structure composed of repeating rectangular merlons and gaps (crenels)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a portion of the structure's top featuring elements that resemble battlements. These include repeating patterns of rectangular, raised sections (merlons) separated by gaps (crenels), typical of medieval fortifications meant for defense. Such a pattern suggests a traditional function and design, indicating the presence of battlements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a long, low brick wall running parallel to the main structure on the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a visible, low brick wall runs the length of the left portion of the frame, positioned parallel to the main structure. This wall forms a boundary consistent with pathways or corridors found near larger structures like castles or fortifications, indicating its role as part of the designed layout in the image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a paved pathway extending from the foreground toward the central archway, running between the low wall and the main structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a path-like area is visible extending from the foreground toward the central structure, situated between the low wall to the left and the main portion of the structure to the right. Commonly, such pathways serve as access routes in architectural designs, guiding movement through space.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there additional arched openings visible to the right of the main central archway, integrated into the same wall structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows several arch-shaped openings to the right of the central archway, localized within the same overall structure. Such architectural openings indicate an integrated design consistent with multi-arch structures, typical for distribution of weight and creating passageways or windows.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the small human figure located on the pathway, positioned behind the viewer and moving toward the central archway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette of a person and a small dog is visible on the pathway leading toward the central archway. Their positioning, with the back facing the viewer, indicates movement toward the structure, aligning with the pathway's directionality, a common depiction in imagery showing depth and journey.",
