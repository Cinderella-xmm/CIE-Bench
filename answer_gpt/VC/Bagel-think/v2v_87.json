      "question": "Does the elephant in the edited image retain large, fan-shaped ears that extend outward from the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the animal appears as part of a miniature diorama with LEGO figures. The elephant is depicted as a small figurine with exaggerated, large, fan-shaped ears, which signify characteristics usually associated with African elephants. This ear shape, extending outward from the head, is recognizable and matches the typical appearance of an African elephant. Despite the miniaturization, the defining feature of large ears is still present, indicating that the elephant retains this characteristic.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the elephant’s tusks long, curved, and off-white in color, extending downward from the upper jaw?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the elephant figurine maintains its tusks, which are small due to the reduced scale but retain the essential characteristics of being slightly curved and extending from the upper jaw area. Although not as prominent as in real life due to the scale and style of the miniature, the tusks adhere to the general form described.",

      "question": "Is the elephant’s skin depicted with deep wrinkles and folds, particularly on the trunk, legs, and ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image presents a highly stylized representation with smooth finishes typical of a miniature diorama and LEGO-like figures. Therefore, the elephant's skin is not depicted with deep wrinkles and folds. The design favors smooth surfaces for ease of recognition and aesthetic appeal in miniature format.",

      "question": "Do the elephant’s feet show five distinct toes on each foot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the elephant is part of a small-scale, stylized diorama. The feet of such miniatures usually have limited detail to maintain simplicity and uniformity, especially in a LEGO-style creation. Consequently, it does not exhibit specific anatomical details such as distinct toes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not include a backpack. It focuses on a miniature scene housed in a box with an elephant and LEGO figures, and the depiction does not extend to including a backpack as in the original image. This scene is focused on elements within the display and not additional accessories like a backpack in similar coloration.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon reviewing the edited image, a backpack is absent. The edited image presents a diorama with an elephant and LEGO characters enclosed in a case. The scene skews towards a minimalistic and tailored environment specific to the display, not including items like a backpack which was in the original setup beside a life-size elephant.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a miniature diorama with an elephant that, while small and stylized, has key characteristics of an African elephant—most notably the large ears. These ears are a distinguishing feature, along with the general shape of the tusks, which also point to the specifics of an African elephant even though it’s a miniaturized version.",
