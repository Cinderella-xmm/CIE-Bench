      "question": "Does the edited image retain the green stem at the top of the orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which features the keychain, a green component is present at the top, resembling the stem which is evident in Image A showing the orange. The green color helps in identifying it with the original stem's placement, despite being a simplified version.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glossy texture of the orange still present on the keychain model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a keychain with a matte or smooth surface, lacking the visible reflections and texture typical of a glossy surface. Unlike Image A, which shows the orange with a shiny, glossy texture, the keychain presents a more plastic-like appearance.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the keychain primarily colored in an orange hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain is indeed primarily colored orange, which matches the color of the orange in Image A. The keychain's color choice aligns with the typical color expectation for objects resembling oranges.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the surface imperfections and texture patterns of the orange persist on the keychain model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A shows an orange with a bumpy texture typical of its peel, while Image B depicts a keychain with a smooth surface. This indicates that the surface imperfections and texture patterns from the original orange do not persist on the keychain model.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the keychain maintain a proportional size and shape relative to the plate it rests on?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the orange is shown relative to a white plate, suggesting it is of significant size relative to the plate. However, in Image B, the keychain dimension and absence of a plate make direct proportional comparison challenging. A keychain's typical size would imply it is smaller than an orange, therefore not maintaining proportional size relative to the previously observed plate.",
