    "Question": "Q1: Is the subject's face clearly showing the same facial structure as in the original image, including the long nose, high cheekbones, and symmetrical eye placement?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, visual cues indicate a mechanical structure overlaying the clothing, adding a steampunk aesthetic. However, since the face is blurred in both images, it's challenging to determine exact facial structures detailing the long nose, high cheekbones, or symmetrical eye placement. Despite this, visual continuity suggests that the rest of the figure maintains a similar posture, which could imply retained facial features. Without visible features, a definitive comparison cannot be made.",
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the subject retain the white powdered wig with voluminous curls framing the sides of the head, matching the original hairstyle?",
    "explanation": "Based on visual cues, both Image A and Image B show a white wig with voluminous curls. This is evident from the rounded curls and typical 18th-century style which remain unaltered between the two images, suggesting the intended depiction of historical European aristocracy.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q3: Are both hands positioned on the armrests of the chair, with fingers relaxed and palms facing downward, mirroring the original posture?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents hands positioned similarly to Image A, resting on the armrests with a relaxed posture. Common cues such as arm positioning on both sides and supported by the armrests indicate this relaxed posture. Despite the additional mechanical elements in the attire, the hand positioning aligns with that of Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the head and body oriented directly forward, with no lateral tilt or rotation, maintaining the original frontal view?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the figure in a direct frontal orientation with no noticeable tilt or rotation, similar to Image A. This viewpoint is characterized by the positioning of the shoulders equidistant from each side, maintaining a symmetry indicative of a frontal view in portraiture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the figure maintain the same proportionate body structure as in the original, with balanced head-to-body ratio and anatomically accurate limb lengths?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's anatomy, such as the head-to-body ratio and limb proportions, remains consistent with Image A, although mechanical elements are integrated. This consistency is noted by matching points across the chest and arms, which align proportionately with historical proportions, suggesting anatomical accuracy.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the light source still coming from the upper left, casting shadows on the right side of the face and clothing as in the original?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting effect, such as highlights and shadows, parallels those in Image A. This is evident from the consistent lighter tone on the left side of the subject and darker shading on the right, indicating an upper left light source.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the shoulders, arms, and facial features aligned symmetrically, with no noticeable imbalance in positioning?",
    "explanation": "Image B maintains shoulder alignment and arm symmetry akin to Image A. The mechanical enhancements overlay these features without altering their fundamentally symmetrical arrangement, preserving overall balance and continuity in positioning.",
    "answer": "Yes"
