      "question": "Is the kite depicted in the shape of a diamond?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects appear to be origami-like folded papers rather than a kite. No object in the image resembles the characteristic structure of a diamond-shaped kite. The folds and shapes of the paper do not form a diamond shape that is typical for most kites. This analysis is drawn from observing that the object shapes in the image are more geometric but not necessarily diamond-shaped.",

      "question": "Does the kite retain its bright yellow color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dominant color of the visible objects is yellow, maintaining a similarity to the commonly expected color for a yellow kite. Even though the shapes aren't confirmed as a kite, the bright yellow color is consistent throughout the image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are two strings visibly attached to the kite?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are no visible strings attached to any objects within the image. The image shows paper folds instead of a structured kite with strings, which would typically be visible if present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to be a plain white surface, likely representing a tabletop or similar, given the presence of colored tapes and other objects. There's no depiction of a sky or any indication that the objects are flying.",

      "question": "Is the kite accompanied by its yellow tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain a kite or tail. The objects in the image are paper forms, none of which include a tail-like structure. A kite tail would usually be evident if present, but there is no such feature visible.",
