    "Question": "Q1: Does the guitar retain its teal color and circular sound hole?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar is observed to have a teal color and a circular sound hole, which are visually evident as teal is a distinct shade visible on the guitar body, and the sound hole maintains a circular shape, typical for acoustic guitars. Comparing this with the guitar in Image A, which also exhibits a teal color and circular sound hole, shows that these features have not changed. World knowledge affirms teal as a common guitar color, and circular sound holes are standard design elements in acoustic guitars.",
    "answer": "yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are there still six tuning pegs on the guitar's headstock?",
    "explanation": "The headstock in Image B is shown with six tuning pegs, which is a standard count for acoustic guitars, allowing for six strings to be tuned independently. This observation is consistent with the design of the guitar in Image A, which also displays six tuning pegs. Knowledge of guitar anatomy confirms that acoustic guitars typically have six tuning pegs to match their six strings.",
    "answer": "yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the microphone still positioned near the guitar?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the microphone remains near the guitar as it is depicted on a stand adjacent to the guitar setup. This is consistent with its positioning in Image A, where the microphone is also on a stand next to the guitar, a typical arrangement for live performances to capture sound. Placement near guitars is a common practice to facilitate live sound capture during performances.",
    "answer": "yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the amplifier still placed behind the guitar?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not show the amplifier behind the guitar; instead, various animated elements are present, such as a pink rose arch and character figures. This differs significantly from Image A, where the amplifier is situated directly behind the guitar, offering a functional setup for amplified sound. Knowledge of musical setups suggests that amplifiers are usually positioned near guitars for optimal sound output, indicating a change in Image B where the amplifier is absent.",
    "answer": "no"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the guitar maintain its original leaning posture against the amplifier?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar does not lean against an amplifier as there is no visible amplifier; the guitar appears upright with surrounding characters and decorative elements instead. This contrasts with Image A, where the guitar clearly leans against the amplifier, a common stance for stability in portable setups. Standard practice involves guitars leaning against surfaces for easy access and stability; thus, the absence of this posture in Image B signifies a change.",
    "answer": "no"
