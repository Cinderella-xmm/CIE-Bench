      "question": "Is there a central root node labeled or represented as \"HOMEPAGE\" positioned at the top center of the diagram?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central area where a 'HOMEPAGE' node would be expected is filled with whimsical elements, including trees, paths, and creatures - none of which are traditional organizational chart nodes. The playful nature indicates a deviation from a standard map structure, meaning a 'HOMEPAGE' node as typically understood does not exist. Therefore, based on visual cues and common understanding of site architecture plans, the concept of a central node labeled 'HOMEPAGE' is absent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there exactly five primary branches originating from the HOMEPAGE node, corresponding to PRODUCTS & SOLUTIONS, ABOUT US, EVENTS & RESOURCES, SUCCESS STORIES, and CONTACT US?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a whimsical, non-standard representation with abstract and playful design components instead of structured branches. No clear primary branches are originating from a central node that would correspond to those specific categories. The design suggests creative interpretation rather than a structured sitemap. Therefore, based on the absence of clearly defined branches corresponding to those categories, this architectural structure does not match the description.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a legend labeled \"SITE MAP KEY\" located in the bottom-right corner of the image, showing color codes for different levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom-right corner contains a whimsical illustration rather than a formal 'SITE MAP KEY' with color codes. The colorful key present seems to relate to the playful, illustrated style more than a structured sitemap with level indicators. Thus, the expected 'SITE MAP KEY' with delineated color codes for sitemap level identification is not present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a playful representation of what appears to be the logo 'to the web' in the top-left corner. It uses a similar design theme but with a more whimsical and colorful style, still reflecting the brand name. Thus, even with stylistic alterations, the 'to the web' brand is recognizable in this section.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's creative style does not incorporate any formal footer-like annotations common in structured diagrams. Instead, it shows artistic flourishes filling the space. A text for 'Privacy Policy' and 'Site Map' specifically labeled as a FOOTER is not evident in the whimsical format of Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no indication of organized, labeled nodes such as 'SUCCESS STORIES' with sub-nodes titled Case Study #1, #2, and #3. Instead, there is a thematic illustration rather than structured data representation. Thus, such specific structured nodes are not present in this version of the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not adhere to structured sitemap conventions but rather showcases a freeform, artistic representation without conventional nodes such as 'Product #3' or 'Product Details.' Thus, any explicit label of 'Product Details' under 'Product #3' is not discernible.",
