      "question": "Is the curved side profile of the grand piano preserved, maintaining its characteristic gentle arc and elongated form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the curved side profile of the grand piano is visible, maintaining its characteristic gentle arc and elongated form even though the contents of the open top lid have been replaced with a makeup palette. This can be determined by observing the overall shape of the piano, which still appears elongated with the recognizable, slightly curved edge of a grand piano's body.",

      "question": "Are the four tapered legs with decorative casters present and positioned beneath the piano body as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the piano retains its four tapered legs with decorative casters similar to those in the traditional design of grand pianos. The positioning of these legs is logical and is shown beneath the piano body to support its structure as per the usual design.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the piano positioned directly in the center of the corridor, aligned with the vanishing point created by the columns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From the visual cues in Image B, the piano seems to be placed centrally within the corridor, aligning symmetrically with the vanishing point created by the perspective of the columns along the sides. This alignment helps maintain the symmetry and visual harmony in the composition.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floor appears to be composed of large square tiles; however, these are uniform in color rather than alternating dark and light shades. The tiles present a consistent color tone across the floor area.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a corridor with tall, evenly spaced white columns extending along both sides, forming a symmetrical passage. This positioning of the columns is suitable for creating a balanced aesthetic that leads the viewer's eye toward the vanishing point.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The piano in Image B retains a highly reflective, glossy black surface, contributing to the aesthetic appeal by subtly mirroring parts of its surroundings. This gloss finish is consistent with typical grand piano designs known for their shiny surfaces.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, soft shadows can be seen cast beneath the piano and along the floor, suggesting the presence of overhead lighting. This indicates a consistent lighting source above the scene, which is common in interior settings where such shadows provide a sense of depth and realism.",
