      "question": "Is the golden-brown crust with visible charred edges present in the character's costume design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character has a hat that is rounded and visually resembles the shape and color of a pizza crust. It is yellow with slight shadows suggesting texture, but it lacks the visible charred edges typical of a baked pizza crust seen in Image A. The costume does not include any feature that explicitly showcases a crust with visible charring. Thus, the costume design does not include the golden-brown crust with charred edges.",

      "question": "Are there visible raised bubbles and browned patches on the cheese-like elements of the character’s costume?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a character wearing a costume that resembles pizza, with elements colored orange and yellow. However, unlike the cheese on a pizza, which typically has raised bubbles and browned patches from baking, the character's costume does not exhibit these specific textural details. The costume instead shows a smoother texture without visible bubbles or browned patches.",

      "question": "Does the character’s body or head silhouette retain a triangular shape reminiscent of a pizza slice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's head is round, and the body is standard in proportion without any angular features resembling a triangle like a pizza slice. Image A shows triangular slices of pizza, but Image B does not match that shape in the character's silhouette. Thus, the character's design does not retain a triangular shape reminiscent of a pizza slice.",

      "question": "Are the dominant colors of the character’s costume primarily golden-orange and yellow, matching the original pizza’s hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B shows a character with a costume colored in shades of orange and yellow. This palette correlates well with the colors of the cheese and crust seen in Image A, which is comprised of golden-orange and yellow hues. Therefore, the costume does match the color palette of the original pizza.",

      "question": "Do the cheese-like parts of the character’s costume show a textured surface with small raised bumps or ridges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the cheese-like parts of the character’s costume do not display a texture with small raised bumps or ridges. Instead, these elements appear smooth and flat. The original pizza in Image A has a textured surface with bubbles, but this texture is not translated into the character's costume.",

      "question": "Is the character designed to represent a single pizza slice rather than a whole pizza or multiple slices?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character looks like it holds or consumes a single slice of pizza. The design does not encompass a whole pizza or multiple slices, as it focuses on a single slice interaction. Compared to Image A, which shows multiple slices on a plate, Image B centers on one slice in the character interaction. Therefore, the character is designed to represent a singular slice.",
