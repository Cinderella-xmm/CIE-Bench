    "explanation": "In Image B, the yellow belly section appears centralized on the body, providing a focal point for the design, which is typical for plush toys aiming for simplicity and visual balance. However, the belly section does not present itself as larger than the head; both are proportionate, but the head is notably distinctive in size and individual features. Toys often have emphasis on head parts for personality capture, thus refuting the claim of the belly being larger than the head.",
