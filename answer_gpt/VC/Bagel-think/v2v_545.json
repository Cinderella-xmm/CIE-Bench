      "question": "Does the sparrow retain its distinct brown, white, and black feather patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow displays a very smooth and uniform coat with creamy white on the underparts, brown on the upper parts, and black around the neck, consistent with the patterning typical of a sparrow. These features align with Image A's portrayal of the same sparrow, indicating the bird's characteristic feather patterns are retained.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow has a small, short, and conical beak, which is typical for sparrows and observed in Image A. The beak's shape and relative size to the rest of the bird's head remain consistent across both images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the sparrow perched on the top rail of the chair in an upright posture, with its body held vertically and head looking slightly forward. This posture is consistent with what is observed in Image A, where the sparrow is also perched on the chair, showcasing the same upright position.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a chair with minimalist styling, consisting of simple horizontal rails and vertical slats. This geometric design matches the structure seen in Image A, indicating the chair retains its basic design features in both images.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow's feet are shown distinctly wrapping around the top rail of the chair, indicating a gripping position. This position reflects the natural way birds perch and is consistent with the positioning seen in Image A, where the sparrow's feet are also gripping the chair's top rail.",
