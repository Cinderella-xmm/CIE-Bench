    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the long, curly, voluminous white beard present and extending down the front of the chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beard of the character is now brown and matches the hair, which differs from the original image where the beard is white. Based on the visual cues and world knowledge of typical Santa costumes, this edited beard is not white.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the thin-rimmed glasses worn on the face, positioned over the eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no glasses are discernible from the visible features of the character, contrasting with Image A, where thin-rimmed glasses are part of Santa's traditional outfit. The lack of glasses on the bridge of the nose in the edited image leads to the conclusion.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the right arm extended outward with the palm facing upward and fingers slightly spread?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right arm is apparent but the palm is facing outward instead of upward. The fingers appear more claw-like and closed rather than slightly spread, diverging from the description.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the mouth curved upward in a smile and the eyes slightly crinkled at the corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial details required for recognizing a smile or crinkling eyes cannot be assessed in Image B due to the blurred facial area. Therefore, deducing these expressions is not possible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the head turned slightly to the left side of the frame, facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head is shown in a forward-facing stance with a slight turn visible in the angle to the left side, which aligns with the posed description.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the facial features including the nose, eyebrows, and cheeks clearly visible and consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features are blurred, making it difficult to identify and compare specific details like nose, eyebrows, and cheeks with the original image's features.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the fingers of the right hand splayed outward with natural spacing between them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fingers of the right hand are more like a claw shape and are not naturally spread with noticeable spacing, as described. This is inferred from the visual appearance.",
