    "explanation": "In Image B, the Elizabeth Tower (commonly known as Big Ben) is positioned on the right side and indeed remains a tall vertical structure. It has a clock face near its top and a pointed spire, although the tower appears to be reimagined with futuristic elements and elaborate decorations, such as mechanical details and vines.

    "Question": "Q3: Is there a red double-decker bus labeled with route number 53 traveling across the bridge from left to right?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a red vehicle resembling a double-decker bus on the left side of the bridge. However, it is highly stylized with exaggerated, futuristic features and glowing elements, which may distort its inscription details. Assuming such artistic alterations, the route number on the bus is not visibly legible or clearly marked as '53' due to the design transformation, differentiating it from the clear '53' in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q6: Are there people visible walking on the sidewalk on the right side of the bridge?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the focus has shifted towards a fantastical design with increased sci-fi elements.
