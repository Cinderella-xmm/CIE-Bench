      "question": "Is the neck of the swan-shaped object still curved in an elegant S-shape, extending upward and backward from the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neck of the swan-shaped object, which is designed as part of a perfume bottle, maintains the elegant S-shape that is typically associated with swans. This design element is visually appealing and it helps in identifying the swan-like motif, even in its transformation into a bottle. The upward and backward curvature is still evident, signifying elegance and continuity between the original ice sculpture and the perfume bottle design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the pink berry-like accents visible on the evergreen sprigs surrounding the base of the swan?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the swan-shaped perfume bottle includes decoration, but it doesn’t feature the pink berry-like accents seen in Image A. Instead, there is a single pink flower near the base of the bottle. This indicates a change in decorative elements, focusing possibly on a floral motif rather than the original berry theme.",

      "question": "Is there a white snowflake-shaped ornament located near the base of the swan?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, near the base of the swan-shaped perfume bottle, there is no visible white snowflake-shaped ornament, unlike the original Image A where such an ornament is present. The focus seems to have shifted towards a more elegant, clean design with a single flower accent in the edited version.",

      "question": "Is the swan/bottle resting on a textured, snow-covered surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the swan-shaped perfume bottle is indeed placed on what appears to be a textured, snow-covered surface. This setting is maintained from Image A, which reinforces the winter or festive theme of the environment surrounding the object.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the background scene from Image A, which features blurred silhouettes of people walking under the strings of colorful, glowing lights. This creates a lively, festive atmosphere, implying that both images share the same environment beyond the changes made to the subject in focus.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head of the swan-shaped object, now part of the perfume bottle design, is oriented towards the left side of the image. This orientation aligns with the typical presentation of a swan’s head in profile and is consistent with the direction seen in the original ice sculpture from Image A.",
