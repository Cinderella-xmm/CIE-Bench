      "question": "Is the cat's fur pattern composed of dark brown or black stripes over a golden-orange base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat sitting on the throne-like chair displays fur that is a mix of dark stripes and a lighter base color. The stripes are a dark brown or black color, and they are overlaid on a golden-orange base, evident on the cat’s limbs and torso. This pattern of stripes over an orange base is characteristic of a tabby cat's appearance, a common domestic cat pattern.",

      "question": "Does the cat have greenish-blue eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cat in Image B exhibits eyes with a discernible greenish-blue hue. This is evident upon close examination of the image, where the eye color features a blend of green and hints of blue, contributing to a striking appearance which is common in some cat breeds.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the cat is shown resting on the throne with its front paws positioned in a relaxed manner, hanging down in front of its body rather than crossed over the chest. This posture is typical of a cat sitting comfortably, mirroring the behavior often noticed in seated cats.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict any throw pillows adjacent to the cat. Instead, the scene features a grand throne setup, with no throw pillows visible. This indicates a shift from a living room setting commonly featuring throw pillows to a throne room setting in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows the cat's tail is not visible along the left side or anywhere on the settee. The setup removes any notion of a settee from the context, presenting the throne setup prominently without a visible tail arrangement.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a throne rather than a settee, with a deep red velvet backdrop and seating. This visual context supports elements of regal and luxurious styling, akin to velvet upholstery though is positioned within the throne setting.",
