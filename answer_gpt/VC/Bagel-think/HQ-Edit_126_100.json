      "question": "Is the child still seated on the edge of the path near the water container, facing away from the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child is visible seated on the edge of the path with similar positioning as expected from the context provided. The childâ€™s position relative to the surroundings, such as the path and water container, suggests he is seated and facing away from the house. Hence, my observation aligns with the scene depicted in the edited image.",

      "question": "Does the curved concrete path extend from the bottom right corner of the image toward the house without deviation or interruption?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual cues indicate that the concrete path smoothly extends from the bottom right corner of the image toward the house without any visible deviations or interruptions. The continuity of the path suggests it maintains its course directly to the house.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a structure to the left of the main house characterized by the presence of a rusted corrugated metal roof. This detail remains evident, confirming the visibility of a smaller building adjacent to the main house.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground showcases large green banana leaves and a cluster of bright orange flowers, positioned just below the main house, making them clearly visible. These elements contribute to the vivid foreground composition.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the satellite dish on the right side of the upper floor, extending outward from the main structure via a black metal pole. Its placement and design detail correspond with expectations based on typical architectural features.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower ends of the stilts do not appear to be directly visible or firmly planted in the soil, as they are obscured by the modifications of the house having replaced them with tree-like structures. These changes suggest deviation from the typical structure seen in traditionally built stilt architectures.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
