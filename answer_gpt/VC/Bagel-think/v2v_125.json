      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style rider is depicted wearing a shirt that appears to be beige. Chibi figures often maintain the general color scheme seen in actual or reference images to aid recognition. The shirt is a similar color to the one seen in Image A which is a light neutral tone indicating beige. Thus, visual cues combined with typical color representation in chibi art indicate the rider is wearing a beige shirt.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Image Bâ€™s horse is portrayed with a coat that appears brown. This is a common and realistic color for horses, often interpreted in the chibi style with a slightly exaggerated and simplified palette matching general perceptions of horse colors. Comparing with Image A, where the horse has a brown coat, the representation in Image B aligns with this color scheme, reinforcing the conclusion.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is illustrated with a tack (bridle) on its head, depicted in the color range perceived as black. Chibi art retains critical details like tack for recognizability, and this matches with Image A, where the horse has a black bridle. Thus, based on visual cues and the common approach in illustrations to reflect key equipment detail, the horse has a black bridle.",

        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the chibi-style rider is depicted next to the horse but not visibly holding any reins. In chibi art, specific actions such as holding objects are usually made prominent for interpretability, and since there are no clear visual cues indicating reins being held by the rider, we conclude that the rider is not holding the horse's reins.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a background with warm earthy tones such as browns and tans which are suggestive of an outdoor environment like a field or farm. In chibi illustrations, backgrounds are often simplified but colored to match coherent logical settings. Comparing this to Image A, which is outdoors with similar tones, the representation in Image B aligns with this color palette indicative of an outdoor setting.",
