      "question": "Does the boy's face retain clear and recognizable features such as eyes, nose, and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face area is blurred, so it does not retain any clear or recognizable features such as eyes, nose, or mouth. The effect is deliberate, likely done for privacy, making it impossible to distinguish individual facial features.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration shows four birds similarly placed: the macaw appears on the shoulder, the cockatoo on the arm, the canary on the head, and the parakeet near the side. The positions align with the original setup, despite the stylized representation in cartoon form.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon print on the boy's shirt is represented in a stylized manner consistent with the overall illustration style. It is visible and intact, maintaining the central elements such as the green color and character depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the boyâ€™s head visibly larger compared to the shrunken size of the birds in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the cartoon-style illustration, the boy's head appears proportionally larger compared to the birds. The head's size stands out more prominently, while the birds appear slightly reduced from their realistic sizes in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a thick white outline surrounding both the boy and the birds, which is a typical feature of cartoon illustrations to define and separate elements distinctly from the background.",
