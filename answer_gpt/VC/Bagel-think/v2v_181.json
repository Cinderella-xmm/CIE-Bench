        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the sheep is depicted as a chibi-style cartoon figure, which often simplifies the form for a cuter appearance. The body of this cartoon sheep resembles the general form of a four-legged animal, typical of standard sheep representations, although it is less detailed and stylized due to its cartoon nature. The depiction follows a familiar four-legged structure seen in simplified animal illustrations.",
