      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the trident with exactly three sharp, symmetrical prongs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the trident held by the figure does have exactly three prongs. They are symmetrically designed, maintaining the classic trident appearance. This matches the general notion of a trident used by the character of Aquaman in popular media.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the geometric patterns (triangular and diamond-shaped plates) clearly visible and intact across the chest, arms, and legs of the armor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armor is smooth and depicted with distinct panels and lines but does not feature the original intricate geometric patterns of triangular and diamond-shaped plates seen in Image A. Instead, Image B's armor has a streamlined appearance with solid panels and smooth lines, not showing the detailed texture and pattern found in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hair long, wavy, and flowing over the shoulders, matching the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, including Image B, the character's hair is long and wavy, extending over the shoulders. This is a common portrayal of this character's attributes, and the edited version retains the same hairstyle, resembling the flowing, natural look from Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the full beard present and clearly visible on the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face in Image B is blurred, making it impossible to discern whether a beard or any facial hair is visible or not. There is no indication of a beard visible in the given region of the image.",

      "question": "Is the right hand positioned firmly on the shaft of the trident, gripping it in a dominant stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right hand of the character is indeed seen gripping the shaft of the trident firmly. The posture and grip suggest a dominant and controlled hold, matching the often depicted hero stance.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the figure maintain an upright, heroic stance with the head turned to the left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the character maintains an upright stance that is typical of a heroic pose. However, in Image B, although the stance remains upright and dominant, the blurred face does not provide clarity on the direction the head is turned. Despite this, the stance in Image B aligns closely with heroic portrayals.",
