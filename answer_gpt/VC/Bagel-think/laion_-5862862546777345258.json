      "question": "Is the central arched doorway with a cross above it present in the same position on the church facade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central arched doorway is visible with a cross right above it; this follows typical architectural design for churches where a notable entrance is adorned with religious symbols for emphasis. Image A also shows the similar feature, maintaining architectural consistency. Therefore, the central arched doorway with a cross is indeed present in the same position.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the round window located directly above the central doorway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the round window is depicted immediately above the central doorway, which is a common design element to create vertical alignment and symmetry on building facades. Comparing with Image A, the round window is similarly positioned directly above the doorway, reaffirming architectural cohesion.",

      "question": "Is the bell tower with a dome and spire visible above the church roof?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a discreetly represented bell tower with a dome and spire as indicated by the stylized representation of the structure. Image A visually confirms this architectural feature; it shows the dome and spire of the bell tower rising above the church roof, characterizing traditional church designs with elevated bell towers.",
      "weight": 3,

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are white umbrellas positioned over tables to the left of the church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a stylized representation of tables without umbrellas in an open space beside the church. Observing Image A, it shows white umbrellas covering tables to the left of the church, often utilized in café settings for shading. The disconnect suggests a disparity in outdoor shade provisions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The representation in Image B includes stylized trees positioned around the open space near the church, likely to simulate greenery typical in outdoor settings. In Image A, a tree is noticeably placed near the café, aiding in natural shade and aesthetic appeal. Both images suggest a presence of trees near the café area.",
      "weight": 2,

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are curved stone steps leading up to the church entrance visible on the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B doesn't incorporate the depiction of curved steps leading up to the church entrance, focusing more on the surrounding open areas and figures. On examining Image A, curved stone steps are prominently noticed, providing elevated access to the church entrance. This inconsistency identifies an omission of this architectural element.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no details explicitly indicate a building with blue-and-white tiled walls or balconies on the left. Image A contrasts this by portraying such a building using blue-and-white tiles and black metal balconies immediately adjacent to the church, signifying its distinct architectural style.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, a small cross is depicted at the highest point of the bell tower, which is typical in church architecture for symbolic elevation. Image A exhibits this feature at the peak of the bell tower, signifying religious prominence.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roof of the church is illustrated primarily by a stylized red coloration, frequently utilized in church architecture for visual identity.
