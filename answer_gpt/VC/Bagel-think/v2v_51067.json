      "question": "Does the image retain the Mercedes-Benz grille and logo on the front of the van?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front grille of the van clearly displays the Mercedes-Benz logo, a distinct circular emblem with a three-pointed star, which is a well-known trademark of Mercedes-Benz vehicles. This is evident from the visual cue of the logo's consistent shape and placement at the center of the grille. Thus, the grille and logo design have been retained in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the overall shape and structure of the van consistent with the original Mercedes-Benz Sprinter design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a van with the typical high roof and box-like body consistent with a Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, as recognized by its elongated body and utilitarian cargo design. Without referring back to Image A yet, the image still reflects the practical design known for Mercedes-Benz Sprinters. Additionally, the visual cues such as the frontal styling are consistent with Sprinter vans.",

      "question": "Are the wheels placed in the same positions and maintain similar sizes as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A comparison between Image B and Image A reveals that the wheels in both images occupy the same positions relative to the body of the van, which is typical for Mercedes-Benz Sprinters where the wheelbase supports the entire vehicle structure. The size and placement of the wheels appear unchanged, reflecting the same scale relative to the van's overall proportions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design of the van still exhibits smooth, clean lines along the body, which is a characteristic feature for cargo vans to maximize space. Notably, there are no visible side windows on the cargo area portion of the van, maintaining the original van's utilitarian form that is practical for cargo space rather than passenger use.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a van with a large windshield that appears consistent with the dimensions typically found in a Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, as seen in Image A. The height and width of the windshield relative to the van body do not show any notable alterations, maintaining the expansive view characteristic of this van model.",
