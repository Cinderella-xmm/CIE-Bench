    {

      "question": "Is the four-legged base of the Eiffel Tower with a central archway present and clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a large futuristic figure is integrated into the structure of the Eiffel Tower, obscuring the actual four-legged base and central archway characteristic of the tower. The futuristic figure forms the new central structure, which covers the original design. Therefore, the typical four-legged base with a central archway is not clearly visible in Image B.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the classical-style building visible through the central arch of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the futuristic figure overlaying the Eiffel Tower, you can still see through the bottom part of the figure, similar to looking through the original archway. The classical-style building that exists in the background is visible through the opening under the futuristic figure's structure, maintaining visibility similar to Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the symmetrical rows of trimmed green hedges present along both sides of the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rows of trimmed green hedges are visible on both sides of the grassy foreground, consistent with the original landscaping seen in Image A. These hedges are consistent features, maintaining the symmetry on either side of the figure and grassy area.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there people visible sitting or walking on the grassy field in front of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are still visible people scattered across the grassy field, sitting or lying down, much like in Image A. The activities and presence of people in front of the new central structure mirror the original scene.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the same sky gradient as seen in Image A, transitioning from a deep blue at the top to an orange hue near the horizon. Despite the changes to the tower structure, the background sky remains unaffected.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing spots representing lights embedded in the hedges are still visible. These lights illuminate the hedges in a similar pattern as seen in Image A, emphasizing their features in the same manner.",
