      "question": "Are the armchairs upholstered in brown fabric with light wooden legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armchairs clearly appear to be upholstered in a brown fabric. The hue is warm and earthy, typical of brown tones. The legs of the chairs are visible and have a lighter wooden appearance, complementing the upholstery while providing structural support. The combination of texture and color suggests common materials such as fabric and light-toned wood, which are widely used for armchairs in interior design.",

      "question": "Are the armchairs placed symmetrically on either side of the central display area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the position of the armchairs is identifiable as they are placed equally distant from the central display area. The symmetry is achieved through their orientation and spacing, which balance the composition of the room around the central featureâ€”a television or artwork. Symmetrical placement is common in interior design to ensure aesthetic harmony.",

      "question": "Is the wall behind the armchairs a plain white surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wall in Image B appears as a simple and uniform white surface. Such walls are typical in many modern interiors due to their versatility in complementing various design elements such as furniture and decorations. The absence of any noticeable texture, patterns, or color variations affirms its plainness.",

      "question": "Does the floor have a glossy polished wood texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flooring in Image B displays a characteristic polished wood appearance, which is indicated by the visible grain and sheen that reflects light. Wooden floors, especially those that are polished, often exhibit a glossy texture that enhances the elegance and warmth of a space. This is a common choice in home decor for its aesthetic and functional features.",

      "question": "Are there soft shadows cast beneath the armchairs on the floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting creates soft shadows under the armchairs, indicative of natural or diffuse light sources. Such shadows add depth and dimension to the scene and are often seen when objects are placed on a reflective or glossy surface like polished wood. The presence of these shadows helps to define the form of the armchairs against the floor.",
