    "Question": "Q5: Is the man standing on a cobblestone path?",

    "Question": "Q6: Is the man positioned at the edge of the pool, facing forward?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the man appears to be positioned at the edge of what could be perceived as a pool, given the water reflection and the arrangement.
