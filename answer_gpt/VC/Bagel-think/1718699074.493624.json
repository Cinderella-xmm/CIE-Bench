    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the angular, multi-tiered headdress with symmetrical side flaps present and unchanged in shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the angular structure on top of the central object maintains its multi-tiered design with side flaps, consistent in both shape and position. The glowing turquoise elements accentuate the symmetry without altering the form or placement.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the eyes glowing amber in color and positioned symmetrically within the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, glowing elements appear but are turquoise instead of amber, and positioned symmetrically around a central axis, not within a face but within mechanical crevices.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the stepped stone pedestal base present with distinct horizontal layers forming a pyramidal shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains a stepped base structure with clear horizontal layers forming a roughly pyramidal shape, further emphasized by glowing turquoise panels.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the segmented mechanical joints visible along the neck, beneath a translucent casing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no visible neck or translucent casing with segmented mechanical joints in Image B; the central structure appears solid, not neck-like.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the head oriented directly forward, facing the viewer without rotation or tilt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Without a distinct head or facial features, orientation in Image B can't be assessed in traditional terms; the central structure maintains a front-facing design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the face symmetrically structured with aligned nose, lips, and jawline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks a discernible face, thus the features like nose, lips, and jawline can't be identified or evaluated for symmetry.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the head positioned directly atop the stepped pedestal, supported by it without floating or being detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central structure in Image B remains securely positioned atop the pedestal base, with no indication of floating or detachment.",
