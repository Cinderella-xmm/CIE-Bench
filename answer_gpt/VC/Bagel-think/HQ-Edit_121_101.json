      "question": "Are the floral embroidery patterns on the sleeves and collar of the hanbok clearly visible and in their original positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral embroidery and sleeve pattern on the hanbok are translated into a decorative design featuring floral elements made from contrasting materials like gold and leather. The patterns are stylized and incorporated into an embroidery-like frame around architectural motifs. This representation does not convey the original textile embroidery, nor are the floral patterns in their original positions or medium.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the jeogori light pink and the chima sky-blue in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pieces of clothing are represented as embossed designs without color differentiation that matches the original pastel tones. The focus of the embossment is primarily on design elements rather than color replication.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a golden-yellow ribbon tied in a bow at the center of the chest on the jeogori?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a bow resembling a ribbon is prominently featured within the embossed design, using a metallic-like gold color. Although this matches the original bow's position and color, it's part of an artistic rendition rather than fabric.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background a traditional Korean palace with multiple curved roofs, red pillars, and green decorative beams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict detailed architecture but creates a stylized representation of a Korean palace roof in an embossed, structured design made with metallic colors on a leather backdrop. The recognizable architectural style is retained conceptually but does not include specific features like pillars.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no human figure imitating the woman's hairstyle, silver hairpins, or central pendant. The focus is on abstracted design elements rather than depicting specific hairstyles or accessories.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there long, dangling earrings with detailed designs visible on both ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a portion of the design includes detailed embellishments, but there are no long, dangling earrings as part of a human figure, focusing instead on floral and architectural motifs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is a pink crossbody bag with a gold chain strap visible on the woman’s shoulder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on abstract, decorative elements and architectural patterns, and no representation of a handbag or accessories akin to a pink crossbody bag with a gold chain is present.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the woman positioned in front of the palace, facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks the depiction of a human figure entirely, thus does not show any positioning of a woman relative to palace architecture. The focus is on embossed patterns and stylized decorative elements rather than an individual in a setting.",
