      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teddy bear is depicted with a more stylized and simplified design, resembling a low-poly or digital art style. The bear appears to have a similar color palette, but its features, such as the eyes and nose, might not be represented as black button eyes and a brown nose due to the artistic style. Therefore, despite a general similarity, the specific features of black button eyes and a brown nose are not visible in Image B.",
