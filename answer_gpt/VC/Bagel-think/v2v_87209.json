      "question": "Does the blue owl still have large white eyes and a yellow beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe a blue owl with features characteristic of a stylized cartoon depiction - notably large white eyes and a prominent yellow beak. This shares similarities with visual cues often present in animated character designs meant to convey cuteness and expressiveness. Thus, the answer is informed by visual observation and common cartoon design practices that the blue owl indeed retains these features.",

      "question": "Are there still smaller owls present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the bottom of the DVD cover, there appear to be smaller owl figures alongside the prominent blue owl, which align with patterns in animation where a lead character is accompanied by smaller, supporting characters. These smaller owls maintain a consistent thematic element of the media representation seen, thus confirming their presence through stylized rendering observed visually.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the text \"OWLEGORIES\" still present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the title 'OWLEGORIES' is clearly visible at the top of the DVD cover. The presence of familiar lettering underpins brand consistency and recognition in media materials. Therefore, the visual inspection confirms that the text is indeed still part of the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the owl still holding a book?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visual evidence of a book being held by any owl, both large and small, as all owl elements either feature animated faces or are part of the cover design. The absence of any depiction resembling a book suggests that a book is not a component within the edited image based on its current composition.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inspecting Image B, there is no visible indication of an interactive or call-to-action element like a 'SHOP NOW!' button typically rendered for purchasing links on digital advertisements found in Image A. The absence of such forms any central objects or text overlays suggests that Image B does not include this element.",
