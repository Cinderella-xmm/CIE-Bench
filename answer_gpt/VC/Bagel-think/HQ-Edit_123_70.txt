    "Question": "Q2: Does the salmon have a clearly defined forked tail fin?",

    "Question": "Q3: Is the bear’s fur rendered with visible texture and layered shading, showing wetness and depth?",
    "explanation": "The bear in Image B is illustrated with some attempts at texturing its fur to depict depth, but the style lacks detailed layered shading that would convey wetness and realistic fur texture. The fur does not exhibit visible depth and wetness as seen in realistic renderings.",
