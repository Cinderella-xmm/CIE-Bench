      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the collar and cuffs feature lacework that matches the style seen in Image A. The lace appears delicate and intricately designed, which is a characteristic of detailed lacework. Based on the visual similarities between Image A and Image B in the lacework regions, combined with the common design elements found in such attire, it's clear that the edited image retains the detailed lacework.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "The sleeves in Image B appear to be puffed, similar to those in Image A. Additionally, the bodice in both images looks fitted and features a similar tight structure as commonly seen in historical clothing styles. This resemblance indicates that the edited image maintains the same puffed sleeve and fitted bodice design as the original.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skirt flares out from the waist, showcasing a voluminous design. This is consistent with the style depicted in Image A, where the skirt has a pronounced fullness. Such design elements are known from historical dresses that emphasize grandeur and elegance. Therefore, the full skirt flaring from the waist is preserved in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "The fabric texture visible in Image B seems to show a floral pattern similar to Image A. Though the resolution differs slightly due to the style change, the presence of floral design can be inferred from Image B's texture, which aligns with the pattern seen in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bodice does not visibly show button closures down the front as seen in Image A. The design in Image B seems simplified, reflecting adjustments typically made when converting details to a digital or illustrative format.",
