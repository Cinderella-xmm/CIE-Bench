      "question": "Is the mustache present with its original shape, including upward curls at the ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the objects and patterns on the suit have been changed to a colorful and abstract style, but the mustache cannot be seen due to the face being blurred. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the provided visual information if the mustache is present or has a specific shape.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the face is blurred, making it impossible to discern the position or symmetry of the eyes relative to the nose.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hair is depicted in a solid color with a stylized, abstract representation in Image B, making it difficult to determine an actual hairline or receding pattern. The artistic rendering obscures such specific details.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'S. W. Kramer.' appears below the image in Image B as it does in Image A. Therefore, both images display the text in the same font and position.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the subjectâ€™s head turned slightly to the left, with the body facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the face is obscured in Image B, the body positioning can be inferred from the shoulder and upper body alignment, which suggests a straightforward body posture without a noticeable turn of the head.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colorful background extends to the edges, obscuring any visible rectangular border or margins that might be present, unlike the clear framing seen in Image A.",
