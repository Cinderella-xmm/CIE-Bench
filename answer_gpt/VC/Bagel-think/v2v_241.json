      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image shows a cartoonish depiction with a horse standing on top of an elephant's back.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image portrays an elephant with rounded features, typical of cartoon or toy designs that are meant for stacking or balancing other objects.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the scene within a cartoonish format, including a created backdrop that imitates elements such as the sky and grass. While the backdrop contains clouds and grass, these elements are stylized and visibly rendered as part of the toy figurine theme, lacking photorealism. The visual cues indicate a deliberate shift from realistic to imaginative scenery.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a playful version where the horse is positioned on top of the elephant, maintaining their spatial relationship from Image A, but within a stylized, framed setting.
