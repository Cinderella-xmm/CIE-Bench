      "question": "Does the edited subject (anthropomorphic bull) maintain the rightward walking posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the anthropomorphic bull is positioned directly facing forward, and there is no indication of rightward motion. Typically, when observing an animal that is facing directly toward the viewer, it suggests a forward or stationary posture rather than a sideward orientation. This is observed in the edited image, demonstrating no rightward walking posture.",

      "question": "Is the saddle and seating arrangement for the riders preserved intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armored knight is riding the bull with an implied saddle as part of the bull's armor, which appears distinctly different from the traditional saddle seen in Image A. While the anthropomorphic bull suggests a seating arrangement through the implied armor, it contrasts sharply with the straightforward saddle arrangement seen in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the riders still positioned directly atop the anthropomorphic bull, maintaining their original relative height from the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armored knight seated on the bull appears elevated and maintains the same elevated relative height from the ground as seen in Image A with the elephant riders. The rider's position gives an impression of being directly atop the bull, similar to how the individuals in Image A are positioned on the elephant.",

      "question": "Does the dirt path retain its uneven and natural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dirt path appears smoother and less rugged than the uneven texture observed in Image A. This suggests a more idealized and fantasy-oriented ground surface, contrasting the natural and rough texture of the path shown in the original image.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Is there natural foliage visible framing the sides of the path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does feature foliage flanking both sides of the path, enhancing the ambiance of a forest setting with trees and leaves visible along the pathway. This resembles the natural framing seen in Image A.",
