    "Question": "Q1: Does the robot still have two distinct upward-pointing antennae on its head?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robot’s head clearly features two upward-pointing antennae, which are typical in designs to suggest communication equipment or sensors on robots. These antennae are visible because they protrude distinctly from the top of the head, and this design element is easy to discern against the relatively uncluttered background. Given their distinct appearance, world knowledge about common robot designs supports the conclusion that they are still present.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is there a blue-tinted visor visible on the robot’s face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, examination of the robot's face reveals a blue-tinted area, likely indicative of a visor. Visors are commonly used as protective eyewear or display screens in robot designs, and the blue hue provides a clue to its function as such. The reflection and hue are discernible enough to conclude this element is present.",

    "Question": "Q6: Are there small green trees present in the foreground and midground of the miniature landscape?",
    "explanation": "Image B includes small green trees clearly present in the miniature landscape, particularly visible at the edges of the platform on which the robot is showcased. Trees are often included in such miniatures to give a sense of scale and natural contrast, making them easily recognizable in this setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is there a visible dust cloud beneath the robot’s right foot?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not contain a visible dust cloud beneath the robot's right foot. The robot is standing on a structured platform in a miniature display, which usually does not depict dynamic environmental effects such as dust clouds.",
    "answer": "No"
