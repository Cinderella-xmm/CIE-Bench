        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image clearly shows a structure with multiple tiers in its roof design, characteristic of traditional stave churches or similar architecture, featuring sharp angles and overlapping sections. This style and arrangement strongly indicate the preservation of a multi-tiered gabled roof. My reasoning is based on recognizing architectural elements that are typical of Northern European stave churches, which are known for their complex roof structures.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon inspection of the roof corners, there are distinct finials shaped like dragon heads. These are characteristic of traditional stave church architecture, meant to evoke historical Viking imagery. The detailed ornamental ends signify the presence of dragon-head finials. I concluded this based on the visual representation of decorations typical in Norse architecture, which commonly include dragon motifs on church roofs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a central spire that is topped with a cross, visible at the peak of the roof structure. This detail is a common feature atop the spires of traditional Christian ecclesiastical buildings. Observing its presence in Image B aligns with the architectural style and religious symbol of a church. Therefore, I use the visual confirmation of a spire with the cross to confidently say that the cross is present.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the exterior walls maintain a textured appearance resembling dark, weathered wood, which is typical of traditional wooden stave churches found in Scandinavia. This texture and color implies an aged, historical look achieved through material choice. My knowledge of construction materials and architectural styles helps to recognize that this characteristic has been preserved in the edited image.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The layout in Image B is symmetrical, with a raised platform and steps visible leading to the entrance, consistent with the design of traditional stave churches. Such symmetrical designs often reflect the architectural symmetry seen in religious buildings, facilitating processional approach. The edited image retains these features which are significant for entrance layout, drawing upon observations of ecclesiastical architectural design.",
