      "question": "Does the edited image retain the airplane's wings, engines, and tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the airplane still displays wings, engines, and a tail, albeit with alterations to the design and color scheme for decorative purposes. The wings remain positioned on either side of the fuselage, as expected. The engines are also present under the wings, although the design has been creatively modified. Similarly, the tail is positioned at the rear of the airplane. These elements identified in Image B align with the conventional parts of an airplane as seen in Image A, confirming their presence in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the airplane located on what appears to be a runway consistent with its position in Image A, judging by the visible pavement and runway markings. The context suggests the airplane is on a runway, adhering to the perspective and spatial arrangement seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the edited image still feature a golden sunset background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B appears to share a similar color palette to that of golden sunsets, characterized by warm, soft tones. This resemblance is due to the sunset-like lighting providing an orange glow, akin to the golden sunset scene depicted in Image A. The use of warm colors in both images supports the continuity of this background theme.",

      "question": "Are the runway markings (\"10\" and guiding lines) still visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, runway markings are visible in the foreground: a double-digit marking similar to '08' or another combination that maintains the essence of runway numerals, and guiding lines are evident. Although the specific digits differ, the concept and visibility of runway markings are consistent with Image A, where '10' markings are present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains a horizon line with distant trees subtly silhouetted in the background, akin to Image A, where the treeline is distinct against the brighter sky. This feature provides a natural backdrop visible beyond the runway and aircraft, confirming its presence in the edited image.",
