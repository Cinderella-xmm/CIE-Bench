    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does each whoopie pie character retain a dark brown chocolate-colored outer layer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which is a cartoon representation, the whoopie pies depicted maintain the characteristic dark brown color typical of chocolate. The visual cues, along with common knowledge of whoopie pie appearance, support the conclusion that the edited image preserves the color characteristic.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a visible white cream filling between the two chocolate halves of each whoopie pie character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon stylization retains the presence of the white cream layer between the chocolate layers. This detail is evident in the continuous white band visible between the brown layers of each character, aligning with common knowledge of typical whoopie pie composition.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does each whoopie pie character maintain a two-layered structure with an inner filling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B shows that each whoopie pie character maintains the typical structure: two outer chocolate layers with an inner white cream filling. Common sense and familiarity with whoopie pie design confirm this observation.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a white plate present beneath the whoopie pie characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no representation of a plate beneath the whoopie pie characters. The cartoon format focuses on the characters themselves without additional props that may be present in Image A, such as a plate.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are at least two whoopie pie characters positioned on the edge of the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B does not depict a plate, there is no way for any of the whoopie pie characters to be positioned on its edge. The setting has been replaced by cartoon elements, excluding any plate positioning.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all whoopie pie characters circular in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the whoopie pie characters as circular, consistent with the typical shape of whoopie pies. The simplification into cartoon form retains this characteristic shape, which is commonly associated with whoopie pies.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a clear contrast between the dark brown outer layers and the white inner filling of each whoopie pie character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the whoopie pie characters exhibit a distinct contrast between the dark brown chocolate outer layers and the white cream filling, a key visual characteristic of whoopie pies. This contrast is effectively preserved even in cartoon form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Do the chocolate tops of the whoopie pie characters show signs of surface cracking or texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, as a cartoon representation, does not include detailed surface textures like cracking. The visual focus is simple and stylized, which generally omits intricate details found in realistic depictions like those in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
