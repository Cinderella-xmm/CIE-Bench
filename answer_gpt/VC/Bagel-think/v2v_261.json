      "question": "Is the surfboard depicted with an elongated oval shape and a central stringer running along its length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfboard is represented as a miniature version within the snow globe. This version is simplified due to the artistic nature of the figurine, where details like the shape being an elongated oval and the presence of a central stringer are not prominently visible. Due to the simplified representation and absence of detailed surfboard characteristics, the answer is No.",

      "question": "Is there a small white wax block being held by the right hand and applied to the surface of the surfboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine inside the snow globe does not hold a visible wax block in its hand. Instead, the right hand is seen positioned near the surfboard without direct depiction of any item like wax. Based on the visual cues provided by the figurine model's artistic design, the answer is No.",

      "question": "Is the right hand positioned so that the fingers are gripping the wax block and making direct contact with the surfboard’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the figurine's right hand positioned toward the surfboard, but the fingers are not depicted as gripping any block. There is no visible wax block or fingers directly applying something onto the surfboard’s surface. The figurine suggests a direction of motion without specific depiction of a wax application action, hence the answer is No.",

      "question": "Is the left hand placed flat on the surfboard, parallel to the board’s surface, providing support?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, the figurine's left hand is positioned near the surfboard, simulating a supportive pose. Due to the stylistic and simplified nature of the artistic representation in the snow globe, the hand placement mimics a supporting action in relation to the surfboard, but does not show the palm flat and parallel as in a realistic scenario. As the artistic design simplifies the details, the answer is No.",

      "question": "Does the surfboard’s surface show a granular, textured pattern consistent with wax application?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the surfboard as a miniature within the snow globe, without clear textured detailing due to artistic simplification. The realistic surfboard's granular pattern is not explicitly visible or suggested due to the figurine's simplistic portrayal. Therefore, the answer is No.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine inside the snow globe is sculpted to mimic a posture that suggests crouching with a slight forward-leaning gesture over the surfboard, indicating knees bent and upper body angled over the surfboard. This design choices in the miniature figurine suggest a representation of the described posture, hence the answer is Yes.",
