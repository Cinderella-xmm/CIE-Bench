      "question": "Is the stapler's primary color blue in both the front and rear views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the front and rear views of the stapler are visible. The visible parts, namely the body of the stapler, appear to be blue in both views. Using the knowledge that staplers are often manufactured in different colors, it is reasonable to affirm that the primary color of these staplers is blue as observed from both angles in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the metallic hinge appear on the stapler in both the front and rear views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front view of the stapler displays a hinge mechanism that is metallic. On examining the rear view, one can observe a metallic component that looks like it could be part of a hinge. In staplers, metallic hinges are commonly used for the movement mechanism. Hence, it seems reasonable to assert that the metallic hinge appears in both views.",

      "question": "Is the stapling slot visible in the front view of the stapler?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front view of the stapler presents the slot where staples would exit during operation. Typically, such slots are located on the front face of handheld staplers, in alignment with where the paper is stapled. The visible opening and position indicate this function. Therefore, the stapling slot seems visible in the front view.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a light blue strip visible on the top surface of the stapler in both views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examining the top surface of the stapler, there is a consistent coloration without any distinct strip. Although the lighting may cause reflections, the surface appears uniformly blue. Using knowledge of design characteristics of typical office staplers, they usually have a smooth monochromatic surface. Therefore, there is no apparent light blue strip observed on the top surface in either view.",

      "question": "Is the background uniformly green in both the front and rear views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background of both views of the stapler is green. The color appears consistent and uniformly spread in both images, covering the backdrop entirely. Common photography setups often involve such uniform backgrounds to emphasize the object being photographed. Hence, it seems reasonable that the background is uniformly green in both views.",
