      "question": "Is the chevron quilting pattern present on the front panel of the bag, forming a series of diagonal V-shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depicted illustration of the bag includes a pattern that closely resembles a chevron quilting design. The chevron pattern typically consists of diagonal lines forming a 'V' shape, and the drawing on the card shows this pattern on the front panel of the bag. The sketch is simplified but clearly indicates the presence of diagonal V-shapes, so based on this illustration, the pattern is depicted as present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there gold-colored zippers located horizontally across the front pocket and vertically along the side panels of the bag?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration of the bag includes lines that suggest the presence of zippers, particularly on the front pocket area. However, the image is a simplistic drawing and does not convey color information such as gold. Therefore, the answer is based on the illustration's inability to depict color specificities like gold.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the brand plaque with the word \"REACTION\" in white capital letters on a black background positioned centrally above the front horizontal zipper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an illustration of the bag, but this drawing does not include specific textual details like the brand name 'REACTION' or a plaque positioned on the bag. As it is a basic sketch that does not include lettering or plaques, it does not depict the brand plaque as described.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there two black curved handles attached at the top of the bag, secured with gold-tone hardware?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a sketch of the bag, which shows handles attached at the top. However, like with the zippers, the drawing is monochromatic and does not specify colors, making it impossible to affirm they are black or attached with gold-tone hardware.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a black shoulder strap attached to the sides of the bag via gold-tone D-rings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes lines suggesting a shoulder strap being attached to the bag's sides, resembling how a shoulder strap would connect to the bag. However, the sketch lacks color information, so it cannot confirm the presence of a black strap and gold-tone D-rings.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question": "Does the bag maintain a rectangular shape with slightly rounded corners and a flat base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the bag with a basic outline, representing a rectangular shape featuring slightly rounded edges. This representation matches the description of a rectangular shape with rounded corners and a flat base, typical for the layout of carrying bags in illustrations.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the brand plaque located directly above the horizontal front zipper, with the zipper positioned below it and centered on the front panel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drawn bag does not show a brand plaque nor provide explicit information indicating relative positions of zippers and plaques, as this is a simplistic sketch without textual elements. Therefore, it cannot confirm the positioning of a brand plaque as described.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B simplifies the bag's design with basic elements and does not include details such as branded tags on zipper pull tabs. It is a mere line drawing that eschews minor specificities like tags and branding details.",
