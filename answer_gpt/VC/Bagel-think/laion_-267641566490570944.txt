    "Question": "Q1: Is the sunlight originating from the upper-left portion of the sky, casting diagonal rays across the mountain range?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is clear evidence of sunlight originating from the upper-left area of the sky. This is indicated by the diagonal rays of light that are visible shining across the mountain range, creating a dramatic effect with highlights and shadows. This visual cue is a common representation of sunlight, supported by understanding the direction of shadows and light beams in natural settings.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are there visible layers of mist or haze separating the mountain ranges at different depths?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, visible layers of mist or haze are noticeable, creating a sense of separation between mountain ranges at varying depths. This visual phenomenon is typical in mountainous landscapes and leads to the perception of depth through atmospheric perspective, where distant features appear more faded or obscured due to mist or haze.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the tallest, most prominent peak located near the center of the image, rising above surrounding spires?",
    "explanation": "The central region of Image B features a prominent peak that rises above the surrounding spires. The positioning and prominence of this peak make it stand out as the tallest in the immediate vicinity of the image. Such visual cues draw the viewer's attention to the central landscape feature, a common compositional technique in landscape photography.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are there green leafy plants visible in the foreground, especially on the left side of the frame?",
    "explanation": "In the foreground of Image B, there are discernible green leafy plants, particularly noticeable on the left side of the frame. These plants add a natural element to the scene, contrasting with the rocky terrain and contributing to the overall composition. Observing the presence of vegetation within a frame is common in landscape imagery, providing a sense of closeness or foreground interest.",

    "Question": "Q5: Does the sky display a gradient from warm orange-pink near the horizon to cooler blue-gray at the top?",
    "explanation": "The sky in Image B exhibits a gradient transitioning from warm orange-pink tones near the horizon to cooler blue-gray tones as it extends upward. This gradient is a typical natural result during sunset or sunrise times, where the sky's appearance changes due to the varying angles of sunlight and atmospheric scattering.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Are there visible rough, dark gray rock surfaces on the mountain sides, especially on the left and right edges of the frame?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are rough, dark gray rock surfaces evident on the mountain sides, particularly noticeable on the left and right edges of the photo. These textural elements contribute to the rugged appearance of the landscape, common in mountainous regions where rocks and cliffs present a significant vertical structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
