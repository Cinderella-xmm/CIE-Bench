    "Question": "Q1: Does the soccer ball retain exactly 12 black pentagonal panels and 20 white hexagonal panels arranged in a spherical configuration?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer ball follows a simplistic pop art style but still visually represents a typical soccer ball design. By analyzing the image, we can see that the ball retains the traditional design of a soccer ball with alternating black pentagons and white hexagons. This closely matches a standard icosahedron-based soccer ball, which commonly consists of 12 black pentagons and 20 white hexagons. Despite the artistic style, the pattern of panels and colors tends to reflect the traditional configuration.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the soccer ball depicted as a three-dimensional sphere with curved surfaces and proper perspective?",
    "explanation": "Image B illustrates the soccer ball using a two-dimensional style characteristic of pop art, which focuses on flat colors and bold lines. The ball lacks the depiction of curvature and depth indicating three-dimensionality, and there is no shading or perspective that suggests a spherical form. It appears more as a flat, graphic representation rather than a 3D object.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the goalpost maintain a rectangular frame with two vertical posts and one horizontal crossbar forming a standard goal shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the goalpost is designed in a cartoonish style with flat, solid colors and outlines; however, it still retains the basic structure of a real goalpost. The goalpost visibly consists of two vertical posts and a horizontal crossbar forming a rectangular frame, which aligns with the standard shape of a soccer goal.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the net of the goalpost composed of a visible grid pattern of intersecting lines forming square or rectangular cells?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the net is represented with a pattern of intersecting lines that form square-like grids. This matches the common design of a goal net, which typically consists of such a grid pattern to ensure balls can be easily seen entering the goal.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the soccer ball positioned in the foreground, in front of the goalpost, with part of the goal visible behind it?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer ball is drawn in front of the goalpost. This perspective places the ball in the foreground, with the front part of the net visible behind it. This is a common visual arrangement to highlight the ball's position relative to the goal.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the seams between the black and white panels of the soccer ball clearly visible and aligned with the edges of the pentagons and hexagons?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the representation of the soccer ball is simplified for artistic purposes. Although the black and white panels are distinguishable, the seams are not depicted with detailed lines. The focus is on the overall pattern rather than accurately portraying the seams between the panels.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the soccer ball centered in the foreground and the goalpost positioned directly behind it in the background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer ball is positioned towards the bottom center of the image with the goalpost directly behind it. This suggests a centered placement in terms of layout, although given the artistic style, precision in centering can be more interpretive. Nonetheless, the compositional arrangement generally aligns description-wise with what is being asked.",
    "answer": "Yes"
