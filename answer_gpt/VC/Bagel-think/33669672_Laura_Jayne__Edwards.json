      "question": "Is the background a solid turquoise color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to be a uniform shade of turquoise, without any apparent patterns or variations. This conclusion is drawn from observing the consistent color and texture throughout the entire background, indicating that it is indeed a solid color.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors teal, red, pink, white, and black present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the primary colors observed are turquoise for the background, which is similar to teal, and gold for the subject, which can reflect light and may have undertones that change in appearance. The flowers and embellishments, however, are not distinctly visible as pink, red, white, or black due to the metallic transformation. The visual effect suggests a lack of variety compared to Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is positioned with an extended arm reaching forward at a diagonal angle, while one leg is stretched out behind them. This pose implies a dynamic and diagonal stance, which aligns with the description provided.",

    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boots feature decorative floral-like elements around the calf area. Such embellishments can be seen attached and wrap around the boots, indicating decorative adornments.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boots worn by the subject display a clear high-heeled form. The structure of the boots at the back, extending vertically, is characteristic of high-heeled footwear.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there bracelets on the subjectâ€™s wrists?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire body has been transformed into a golden metallic appearance, making it difficult to discern specific accessories like bracelets. Without comparison to Image A where the bracelets are visible, one cannot confirm their presence in Image B alone.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the subject have long black hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair of the subject extends downwards in a long, smooth form but is rendered in a metallic gold color rather than black. Based on the styling and length, it retains the semblance of long hair.",
