    "Question": "Q1: Is the black drawer cabinet still present below the round mirror?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, we observe a small object with a similar shape to a drawer cabinet, featuring six drawers. However, it appears to be an abstract or miniature representation owing to its simplified design and size, unlike the more detailed and realistic black drawer cabinet in Image A. The comparison indicates that the original black drawer cabinet has been replaced by this miniature version in Image B.",

    "Question": "Q2: Does the image still feature a large round mirror above the drawer cabinet?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a large circular object suggestive of a mirror, giving the impression of a simplistic, basic shape rather than a functional mirror. In contrast, Image A features a more realistic round mirror situated above the drawer cabinet. Hence, Image B retains a conceptual representation of a round mirror but lacks the detailed, realistic appearance.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is natural light still entering the room from the window on the left side?",
    "explanation": "Image B is dominated by a singular, isolated object set against a plain white background, lacking any window or additional room features.

    "Question": "Q4: Is there still a potted plant with long green leaves on the right side of the drawer cabinet?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no potted plant present, with the only object being a small model resembling a mirror-cabinet configuration.

    "Question": "Q5: Does the floor still have a light wood texture?",
    "explanation": "Image B lacks a discernible floor texture, comprising solely of a model object against a plain white background.
