      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the saree on the statue features intricate carvings that resemble floral and paisley patterns.

      "question": "Is the saree draped with the pallu over the left shoulder and the pleats aligned vertically at the front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the saree on the statue is draped with the pallu (the end part of a saree) over the left shoulder. The pleats are visible and aligned vertically at the front of the statue, consistent with traditional saree draping styles.

      "question": "Is the multi-layered choker necklace positioned around the neck, with dangling elements visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a choker necklace positioned around the neck area of the statue. However, due to the deterioration and general lack of precision typical in ancient stone carvings compared to textiles and metalwork, the details of any possible dangling elements are not clearly distinguishable or as elaborate as seen in a real choker with dangling elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a bracelet can be observed on the right wrist of the statue. It corresponds in placement with traditional jewelry wear, but the intricate design detail might not be as precise as textile embroideries due to the limitations of stone carving techniques. The bracelet's presence aligns with its typical placement.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no ring can be distinctly identified on the index finger of the right hand of the statue. Considering the carved nature of the image, fine details like small rings are often not portrayed in stone sculptures.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a clearly defined border along the edges of the saree, including the pallu and hem. Although the medium limits the display of the original fabric's pattern intricacies, the borders are distinguishable and reflect the original's layout.",
