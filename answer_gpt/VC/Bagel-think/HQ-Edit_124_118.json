    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the central waterfall positioned vertically in the middle of the image, descending from the upper cliff to the river below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waterfall appears more like an ethereal, illuminated installation, rather than a natural waterfall. The central feature seems to be these vertical glowing strands that resemble water, but it's highly stylized and does not depict a natural cliff or riverbed. The setting is indoors with visible ceiling structures, suggesting it's an artistic or installation piece. There is no physical river visible below as we would expect from a natural waterfall.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a large, curved tree on the left side of the image with a diagonal branch extending upward and bearing clusters of small purple flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features stylized, glowing tree-like structures within an indoor setting, but they do not have the characteristic natural branches or host real flowers. Instead, the trees seem to reflect digital or neon attributes, lacking natural elements such as branches bearing small purple flowers.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the river originate in the foreground and curve toward the base of the central waterfall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there may be a semblance of a water-like LED or neon feature extending towards the base of the glowing strands, it is not a natural river originating from the foreground as Image A's river. The setting is indoors, and thus lacks natural water flow.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible rocks scattered along the riverbed in the foreground and midground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any rocks or natural riverbed elements, as it primarily consists of indoor art installations with glowing and vibrant light features mimicking nature themes. There is no visible natural landscape or riverbed with rocks.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there two smaller waterfalls visible on the right-hand cliff face, behind the main waterfall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, simulates a digital installation of a waterfall but lacks natural cliff faces or smaller waterfalls. The scene is not outdoors but an indoor artistic space. There are no characteristic cliff features or multiple waterfalls.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a dense canopy at the top of the image with sunlight streaming through gaps, creating bright patches on the foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting is an indoor environment with artificial lighting. While there is a tree-like structure emulating a canopy, the use of light is part of the artistic display, rather than sunlight streaming naturally through foliage.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there small purple flowers growing on the left side of the twisted tree, near the base of its branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree structures depicted are more of digital, neon representations without real branches or flowers. The lack of real plant life indicates there are no actual purple flowers at the base or anywhere else.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there multiple mountain ridges receding into the background, fading into a hazy blue sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, being an indoor installation, does not feature a natural environment with mountain ridges or sky. The background is part of an enclosed space that lacks distance elements such as sky and mountains.",
