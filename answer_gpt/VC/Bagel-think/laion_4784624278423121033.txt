    "Question": "Q1: Does the atomic design retain the three intersecting elliptical orbits with a central nucleus and three electron positions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the atomic design is depicted as a stylized representation with various abstract and colorful shapes. The iconic model of an atom typically consists of three intersecting elliptical orbits. Upon visual inspection, this design in Image B includes a large orange figure that might be intended to roughly mimic an atom, but it doesn't strictly adhere to the described atomic model attributes such as intersecting orbits or specific electron positions.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Is the white plastic cookie cutter retaining its original atomic-shaped outline with three elliptical loops and a central nucleus?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the visual focus is on diagrammatic and abstract illustrations rather than depicting a physical object like a cookie cutter. The original shape and form of the physical white plastic cookie cutter, reflecting atomic models, aren't represented within these stylized shapes or text annotations.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the cookie cutter positioned to the left of the atomic imprint, with a partial edge overlap?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not feature a physical cookie cutter nor does it show an arrangement involving positioning or overlapping with atomic imprints. The image is more of an illustrative and conceptual representation of cookie designs rather than showing physical positioning or arrangements akin to those of a real-world setup.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the atomic imprint in the dough have clean, continuous edges without breaks or distortions?",
    "explanation": "Image B is an artistic and stylized illustration rather than a direct depiction of a physical item like dough with imprints. It doesn't showcase the details or texture characteristic of a physical imprint with concerns about edge continuity or alignment.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a small central hole in the nucleus area of the atomic imprint?",
    "explanation": "The visual elements in Image B are conceptual designs and don't show physical attributes like textures or imprints where small holes or similar details might exist. There isn't an explicit representation of a hole in any central nucleus area as expected if comparing with a real-world, dough-cut scenario.",
    "answer": "No"
