      "question": "Does the image retain the cylindrical, elongated shape of the baseball bats?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the outline of the two objects in the center have retained their cylindrical and elongated form, resembling baseball bats. The shape appears consistent with common knowledge of how baseball bats are designed. Despite potential changes in texture and coloring, the basic silhouette corresponds to the original object's structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the black taped handles of the bats still distinctly visible against the wooden shafts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handles of the bats have a darker coloration that differentiates them from the lighter wooden shafts, suggesting that the black taped handles are still visible. This visual distinction aligns with common handling designs for bats, where handles are often darker for grip purposes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the two baseball bats remain parallel to each other in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual arrangement of the bat-like objects in Image B maintains a parallel orientation. Both objects run alongside each other without any apparent divergence in their paths, suggesting they remain arranged in parallel as seen in general object placement knowledge for parallel alignment.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the bats still placed on a grassy surface, indicating an outdoor setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B consists of colors and patterns that imitate a texture resembling grass, which suggests the objects retain their placement outdoors on a grassy surface. Despite alterations in color and artistic rendering, the portrayal aligns with common visual depiction of grass from a field setting.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bats maintain their slight angle toward the viewer, preserving perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual perspective indicates that the bats or cylindrical objects project toward the viewer with a perceptible angle, maintaining a sense of depth and three-dimensional positioning. This portrayal is consistent with the expectation for objects seen from a slightly angled viewpoint to convey perspective.",
