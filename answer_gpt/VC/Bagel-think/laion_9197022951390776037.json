      "question": "Is the word \"SCARECROW\" clearly visible and legible on the label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, where a bottle of a wine label is presented, there is a text that appears to be intended as a replacement for 'SCARECROW.' However, the text does not appear as 'SCARECROW'; instead, it is unintelligible and does not form recognizable or coherent words. This is a visible difference as compared to expectation from a typical wine label that should be legible and indicate the product clearly.",

      "question": "Is the year \"2017\" visible somewhere on the bottle or label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the section where a year, such as '2017', would typically be placed appears to be blank or occupied by nonsensical text rather than actual numerical data. This suggests the label does not contain the year '2017', as would be typical for a wine bottle indicating its vintage.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the icon at the top of the label, now transformed into a face, retain the shape of a straw hat and rustic features consistent with a scarecrow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, an icon does exist at the top of the label, but instead of the original scarecrow icon, it appears to be anthropomorphized with features resembling a face and robotic components, which do not align with a scarecrow's rustic features or straw hat appearance generally associated with scarecrows.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the label still a rectangular shape positioned centrally on the front of the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the label maintains a traditional rectangular shape that is centrally positioned on the front of the bottle. This corresponds with standard labeling practices seen in wine bottles and aligns with the typical bottle presentation format.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the bottle oriented vertically, standing upright?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, inspecting the orientation of the bottle reveals it is indeed standing upright, as evidenced by the vertical alignment of the bottle's shape and the content within the respective scene. It parallels common bottle positioning for display or photography.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Reviewing Image B in the context of the bottle's vertical orientation, the label is placed centrally along the vertical section of the bottle, which is typical for wine bottle labels and ensures balance and readability of any content featured on it.",
