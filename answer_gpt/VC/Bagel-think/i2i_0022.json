      "question": "Is the cat depicted in a curled-up position with one paw visibly stretched out?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is illustrated in a curled-up position, based on the curved outline of its body, with visible body lines suggesting a curled posture. There is no paw shown visibly stretched out; the image focuses on a simplified illustration common in stickers, avoiding detailed limbs. Such depictions are typical in sticker design to maintain simplicity and functionality. Therefore, the absence of any stretched limb or paw is intentional for design clarity.",

      "question": "Is the cat shown lying on a curved surface representing the car's hood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a cat illustration without any context or background, such as a car hood. The image seems flat, focusing solely on the cat figure, which is common in stickers. Stickers are typically designed to be pasted onto surfaces rather than depicting surfaces in the image itself, reinforcing clarity and thematic focus.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there reflection lines present on the curved surface under the cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration of the cat does not include a surface under it nor reflection lines. The image is intended to be a standalone element without depicting additional details like reflection lines, which would be common in more realistic photography but not in a simplified sticker design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the entire sticker image surrounded by a thick white outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sticker illustration is encapsulated by a noticeable thick white outline. This is a common design feature for stickers, helping distinguish them from the background when applied on various surfaces, ensuring focus on the main design and increasing visibility.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the sticker have a transparent background behind the outlined image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background behind the sticker is white, not transparent. Typically, stickers are designed with a solid background to provide contrast and help the visual element stand out, which is evident here with the white background accentuating the cat illustration.",
