    "Question": "Q1: Is the central floral medallion located on the front center of the body, surrounded by symmetrical scrollwork?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object being analyzed is a candle, not a teapot. The candle is encased in a decorative holder with symmetrical scrollwork near the top rim. However, there is no central floral medallion on its body similar to what would be found on a teapot. In Image A, the central floral medallion is indeed located on the front center of the teapot as part of the ornate design.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the spout extend from the left side of the body with a curled, scroll-like tip?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a candle, which does not have a spout. In Image A, the object is a teapot with a spout that extends from the left side with a curled, scroll-like tip. When comparing to Image B, this feature is not present since Image B does not involve a spout or teapot.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the handle on the right side of the body shaped like a C with ornate volute ends?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a decorative candle holder with no handle. In Image A, the teapot has a handle on the right side, which is shaped like a C and includes ornate volute ends.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a small decorative finial atop the lid?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the candle's lid has a decorative finial at the top. This design choice mirrors the small decorative finial on the lid of the teapot in Image A, offering continuity in the ornamental style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there four ornate feet supporting the base of the object?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the candle rests on a marble-like platform without any ornate feet supporting it. In contrast, the teapot in Image A has a base supported by ornate feet. Therefore, this feature is absent in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the floral and foliate patterns arranged symmetrically around the body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the candle holder has elegant vertical patterns that hint at symmetry, but do not match the floral and foliate symmetrical arrangement found on the teapot body in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the object retain the same overall rounded silhouette with a domed lid and balanced spout and handle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the candle's silhouette is vertical, cylinder-like with a domed lid, lacking a spout and handle, whereas Image A's teapot features a rounded silhouette with a domed lid alongside a spout and handle. Hence, the overall form is not consistent with the original teapot's silhouette.",
    "answer": "No"
