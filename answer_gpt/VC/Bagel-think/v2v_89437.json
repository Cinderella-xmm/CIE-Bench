      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue 'ALSC' text, accompanied by an integrated black checkmark, is positioned in the bottom right corner.

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there exactly five orange circular markers positioned along the black checkmark pathway, each containing a white icon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a total of five orange circular markers along the black checkmark. By examining each circle, it's confirmed that there is a white icon within each one, representing different steps in the process. This matches the expected layout for the process described.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the icon in the first orange circle (bottom-left) a white magnifying glass over a document?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the first orange circle located at the bottom-left contains an icon of a white magnifying glass over a document. The depiction is clear and matches the typical representation of document verification, which is often symbolized by a magnifying glass.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Adjacent to the first orange circle in Image B, the text reads 'We verify your Document'. This aligns with the idea of the verification process depicted by the magnifying glass icon in the circle, confirming the textual information for this step.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, rather than blue dots, there are red ribbon-like elements weaving around the black checkmark pathway. This indicates a modification from the original design, where one might expect blue separator dots between orange circles in other schematic representations.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of Image B, 'ALSC 5 Easy Steps' is prominently displayed in a bold blue font. Directly below it, in a smaller blue font, the subtitle reads 'For documents to be used in Qatar'. This setup matches the standard layout for titles and subtitles in schematic guides.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is predominantly white. However, there are red ribbon-like patterns intertwined within the checkmark pathway, creating visual texture within the otherwise plain white space. This presence of red patterns means the background isn't entirely plain.",
