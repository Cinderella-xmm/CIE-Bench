      "question": "Is the gorilla depicted with predominantly dark gray to black fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a figurine inside a box that resembles an animal, likely a small gorilla-like or mythical creature, covered in dark fur. However, unlike Image A, the edited image of the figurine does not specifically depict a gorilla with predominantly dark gray to black fur. Instead, it features a cartoonish and stylized character. Therefore, the observation does not match that of a full-sized, realistic gorilla with such fur.",

      "question": "Does the gorilla have dark, almost black skin on its face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B independently, the figurine is characterized by a cartoon-like face with black eyes, but it does not showcase dark skin resembling a gorilla's face. The designed face appears more plastic-like and lacks the specific skin tone and texture typical of real gorillas. The question pertains to features more closely aligned with realistic depictions of gorillas as seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the gorilla shown with a broad, muscular chest and visible pectoral definition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's stylized representation does not display detailed musculature typical of a realistic gorilla. It has a simplistic and exaggerated body form, with a torso lacking realistic muscular definition or anatomy, unlike Image A. Hence, the depiction cannot be described as broad or muscular, especially with visible pectoral definition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a lighter-colored area on the gorilla’s back and shoulders, indicative of a silverback?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On reviewing Image B, the figurine does not show a lighter-colored area on its back and shoulders as would be indicative of a silverback gorilla. The creature continues to sport uniform coloration with no hint of a silverback's characteristic lighter shades. This decision reflects its stylized and toy-like depiction contrary to the realistic appearance of gorillas",

      "question": "Does the gorilla have a broad, flat nose and prominent brow ridges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toy character has a simplistic cartoon-like face without realistic features such as a broad, flat nose or distinct brow ridges. Its facial design is stylized, deviating from typical gorilla anatomy as seen in Image A, where such structures would be present. Thus, the figure in Image B does not offer the realistic facial characteristics of a gorilla.",

      "question": "Are the gorilla’s hands placed on its chest in a dominant stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B alone, the character holds a stick with its hands resting against its body, not specifically in a dominant or chest-beating position reminiscent of gorillas demonstrating dominance or aggression. This stylized representation does not capture the dynamic posture typically observed in Image A's gorilla stance.",
