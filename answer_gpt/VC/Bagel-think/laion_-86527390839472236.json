      "question": "Are the original seam lines (including those around the front pocket and vertical panel divisions) preserved as embossed linear patterns on the transformed glass vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The second image shows a glass pump bottle with a smooth surface and no visible embossed patterns. In the original image, the suitcase has seam lines and vertical panel divisions that are typical for luggage design, but these features are not evident on the glass vessel. A comparison of the two images confirms that the embossed patterns are absent in the transformed object, leading to the conclusion that the seam lines are not preserved as embossed patterns.",

      "question": "Is the brand logo positioned near the top center of the front face of the transformed object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second image, the logo of the brand 'INCOTH' is placed near the top center just below the nozzle, which corresponds to a prominent branding position. The original image of the suitcase does not have a logo strictly at the top center, but rather on the framed pocket area below the handle. However, based on the position of the logo in the edited image, it can be concluded that the brand logo is indeed positioned near the top center of the glass vessel's front face.",

      "question": "Is the metallic spray nozzle located at the top center of the object, aligned vertically with the original handle’s position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The second image features a spray nozzle at the top center of the glass bottle, indicating its central alignment. In the original image, the handle is located at the top center of the suitcase. Thus, the spray nozzle in the edited image aligns with the position of the original handle of the suitcase, matching vertically.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The second image does not display any decorative caps at the base corners. The original suitcase image features four wheels at the corners, which are absent in the transformed glass vessel. Hence, these decorative elements are not present in the transformed object.",

      "question": "Are the two zipper tracks of the front pocket preserved as linear features on the transformed object, maintaining their parallel alignment and position within the front panel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The second image of the glass vessel does not feature any visible linear designs or indentations that could represent zipper tracks. The original suitcase image displays zipper tracks along the front panel, but these features are not carried over to the transformed object and thus are not preserved on the glass bottle.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second image, the glass vessel lacks any visible side handle that aligns with the suitcase’s original design, which includes a side handle on the right. This feature is absent in the glass bottle. Thus, no handle is present in the transformed object.",
