    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the original grayish stone texture of the pyramid’s surface retained, including visible weathering and erosion patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pyramid's surface appears to have a transformed texture with luminescent blue elements and greenish hues instead of the natural gray stone with weathering and erosion patterns seen in ancient structures. This indicates a significant alteration in the original texture.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the top platform of the pyramid preserved as a flat, rectangular structure with defined edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top platform in Image B features a circular, glowing blue element, altering its originally flat, rectangular appearance and defined edges noted in traditional pyramid designs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the central staircase remain aligned along the front face of the pyramid, extending from the top temple to the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central staircase in Image B is maintained in the correct alignment along the front face, extending from the top to the base, consistent with its design in ancient pyramids, despite other visual additions.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there exactly nine distinct tiers visible in the pyramid’s structure, decreasing in size from bottom to top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pyramid's tier structure, crucial to its design, is obscured by added glowing elements and foliage, making it difficult to distinctly count nine separate tiers.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are patches of moss and small vegetation visible along the edges and steps of the pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the pyramid as covered with enhanced green luminescent features rather than natural patches of moss or small vegetation typically observed on historical structures.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the shadow cast by the pyramid positioned to the lower right, consistent with sunlight coming from the upper left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the appearance of shadows is largely overshadowed by a bright, luminescent surrounding, making a clear assessment of shadow direction against sunlight challenging.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the pyramid located in the center of a dense tropical jungle, with trees surrounding it on all sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Similar to Image A, Image B shows the pyramid centrally located amidst a dense tropical jungle, maintaining the surrounding lush landscape, even though there are blue glowing elements added.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the top platform of the pyramid covered with dry soil and patches of moss, indicating natural overgrowth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top platform in Image B appears to feature a mystic blue glow instead of natural elements like dry soil or moss, vastly differing from a natural state of overgrowth.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Are there multiple white vehicles parked on the grassy area near the base of the pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, there appear to be multiple white vehicles parked near the pyramid's base. The presence of these vehicles suggests some modern activity in the vicinity.",
