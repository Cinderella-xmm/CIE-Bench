      "question": "Is there a golden circular halo positioned directly above Mary's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, observe the area around Mary's head. There is a large halo-like object that appears to be circular and has a golden coloration. This matches the traditional depiction often seen in religious representations, where a halo signifies holiness. Such imagery is common knowledge and recognizable due to its frequent use in religious iconography. Therefore, the halo is visually and conceptually consistent with a golden circular halo positioned directly above the head.",

      "question": "Does Joseph hold a staff with a white lily flower at its tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examine Joseph's hands and the object he is holding. The staff ends with a noticeable floral shape which seems to resemble a lily flower in form, even though the color might not be perfectly discernible due to the artistic style of the edit. Traditionally, Joseph is depicted holding a lily as a symbol of purity in religious art. Based on the visual cues combined with this common religious symbolism, Joseph is indeed holding a staff with a white lily flower at its tip.",

      "question": "Is there a golden radiating halo (fan-shaped rays) behind the infant Jesus' head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, observe the region behind the infant Jesus' head. There are distinct golden rays that emanate outward in a fan shape. Such fan-shaped radiating halos are frequently used in depictions of holy figures, especially prominent around the head, signifying divinity and holiness. This matches with the typical representation of the infant Jesus, confirming there is a golden radiating halo behind the head.",

      "question": "Is Mary depicted in a kneeling position with her hands clasped in front of her?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Mary is positioned on her knees. Her hands are visibly together, suggesting a clasped position in front of her body. This posture is consistent with traditional depictions of prayer or reverence, particularly in religious context. Thus, it is concluded that Mary is indeed in a kneeling position with her hands clasped.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the infant Jesus is depicted lying down, and his arms are clearly positioned over his chest. The alignment suggests they are crossed, a posture that is often used to symbolize rest or peace in art. This positioning of arms across the chest is typical in artistic renderings and matches traditional iconography of the infant Jesus.",

      "question": "Are the figures arranged such that Mary is on the left, Joseph on the right, and the infant Jesus is centrally located between them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By analyzing the arrangement in Image B, Mary is located on the left side of the image, Joseph on the right, and the infant Jesus is placed centrally between them. Such a composition is typical in nativity scenes, providing a triangular composition that focuses viewersâ€™ attention centrally on the infant. This arrangement thus matches the described positioning of each figure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground below Mary and Joseph is stylized but appears more uniform than the rocky bases in Image A. While the decorative elements on the bottom can be seen, they resemble more of a continuous surface possibly meant to invoke a platform rather than distinct rocky bases. Thus, they are not standing on separate rocky bases.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area immediately below the infant Jesus shows texture and color that resemble a soft, fluffy surface, consistent with the depiction of a bed or cushion often used in nativity scenes to indicate comfort and care. The color and texture are visibly white and fluffy, which affirms the presence of such a surface beneath the infant Jesus.",
