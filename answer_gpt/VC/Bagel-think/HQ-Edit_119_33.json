      "question": "Is the subject's skin tone dark brown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's skin tone is depicted in a stylized and simplified manner using flat colors and patterns typical of stained glass artwork. The colors used do not explicitly indicate a dark brown skin tone and are more abstract and artistic. Thus, judging purely from Image B, the skin tone is not dark brown in the traditional sense.",

      "question": "Is there at least one sunflower placed in the subject's hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hair features floral detailing, where abstract shapes resembling sunflowers are integrated into the design. These are stylized representations of the sunflowers, which can be interpreted as being placed in the subject's hair.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the subject wearing a yellow dress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the subject with a dress colored in shades that include muted yellows and browns. The stylization in Image B uses various warm colors and patterning that suggest the dress might be yellow or have yellow components, aligning with a creative rendition of a yellow dress.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the subject's head turned slightly to her right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stylized nature of Image B makes it challenging to definitively determine the direction of the subject's head turn due to the lack of clear facial features. However, the positioning of the neck and shoulders suggests a slight turn to the right.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the subject standing within a sunflower field?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses patterns and floral motifs resembling sunflower shapes extensively throughout the background. The style and arrangement suggest a field of flowers around the subject, akin to standing within a sunflower field.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stylized artwork of Image B does not present conventional lighting cues apparent in realistic images. In image B, the distribution of color and pattern does not suggest a clear directional light source typical of realistic lighting scenarios.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's face is not detailed enough to convey expressions or facial features such as a smile or teeth due to the abstract and patterned nature of the artwork.",
