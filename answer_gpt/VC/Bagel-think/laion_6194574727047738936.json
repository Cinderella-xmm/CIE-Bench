      "question": "Is the pink flamingo-shaped mug with a white beak and curved neck present in the same position relative to the cereal bars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pink flamingo-shaped mug is visible and has features such as a white beak and a curved neck. Its relative position concerning the cereal bars appears consistent with previous typical positioning patterns, such as being slightly to the side. To determine the exact position relative to the cereal bars, comparing its placement with Image A reveals that it remains in a similar relative position.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the words \"freee\" and \"corn flakes\" visible on the cereal box, along with the bird logo above the brand name?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design on the cereal box has been altered to include a fictional brand name and graphics. The original text 'freee' and 'corn flakes', accompanied by a bird logo, have been replaced with playful and abstract text that does not convey the same information. Comparing this with Image A, where 'freee', 'corn flakes', and the bird logo are clearly visible, highlights the absence of these elements in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the circular illustration of a bowl filled with corn flakes visible on the front of the cereal box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a circular illustration with a smiling face is present on the cereal box design, but it does not depict a bowl filled with corn flakes. Instead, it has been stylized and does not appear to directly represent corn flakes as seen in Image A, where a bowl of corn flakes is clearly illustrated on the box.",

      "question": "Is the light-colored wooden surface visible beneath the cereal bars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface beneath the cereal bars is visible and appears light in color, seemingly wooden. When comparing with Image A, the wooden texture and color are consistent, confirming that a light-colored wooden surface is depicted under the cereal bars.",

      "question": "Is the off-white wall visible in the background behind the cereal box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background immediately behind the cereal box is not focused on an off-white wall but rather complements the energetic and playful theme of the illustration with different colors and elements. Image A features an off-white wall behind the box, highlighting the difference and confirming its absence in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pink flamingo mug is positioned in a manner that appears to be behind and slightly to the side of the cereal bars. This adheres to the typical setup found in Image A, where the mug is also behind the cereal bars on the left side, suggesting the positioning remains the same in both images.",
