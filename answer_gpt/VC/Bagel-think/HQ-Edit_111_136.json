    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the dancer depicted with her left leg lifted and bent at the knee, while her right foot remains planted on the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is portrayed in a dynamic pose with her left leg clearly lifted and bent at the knee, while her right foot appears to be firmly on the ground. This can be inferred from the stance of the legs and the way they are positioned, suggesting an action pose typical of dancing.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dancer positioned on the right side of the image, facing toward the left side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is indeed positioned on the right side of the image, with her torso turned and arms extended towards the left side of the frame. This orientation suggests that she is facing toward the left, consistent with a pose that implies movement across the image from right to left.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the skirt of the dancer appear to be flared outward and upward due to motion, suggesting a spinning or leaping movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dancer's skirt in Image B is depicted as flared outward and upward. This is typical in artworks that aim to convey motion, such as spinning or leaping, where the clothing would naturally take on this shape due to movement and centrifugal force.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the dancer positioned in the foreground, with a group of animals in the midground and trees in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition clearly places the dancer in the foreground because of her size relative to other objects and the clarity of her depiction. Behind her, a group of animals can be seen, suggesting a midground placement, with acacia trees in the far background providing depth to the scene.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the light source coming from the right side of the image, illuminating the dancer and casting shadows to the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B appears to come from the right side, illuminating the dancer's body and creating shadows toward the left. This is suggested by the highlights on the right side of the body and the shadowing effect observed on the left side of both the dancer and other elements in the scene.",
