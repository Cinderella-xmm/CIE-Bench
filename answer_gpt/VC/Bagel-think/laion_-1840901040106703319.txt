    "Question": "Q1: Are the three triangular windows positioned at the apex of the A-frame roof clearly present and maintaining their triangular shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, we observe that the apex of the A-frame roof is covered with faceted, complex shapes resembling crystals which do not clearly exhibit the triangular windows' presence or their shape. The visual complexity and pattern in Image B differ significantly from typical triangular windows.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the cabin structured with a raised deck on the upper level and a garage on the lower level, maintaining the same vertical separation?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows an artistic representation using geometric patterns where the overall structure of a raised deck and lower level is abstracted. There isn't a clear division showing the garage or distinctive deck features, suggesting a breakdown of the original vertical separation visible in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the garage door located on the right side of the lower level, adjacent to the main entrance?",
    "explanation": "Image B, due to its geometric abstraction, does not depict clear garage doors or distinguishable entrances akin to a conventional cabin architecture. The visual complexity overrides specific structural features making them indistinguishable.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the cabin symmetric about its central vertical axis, with the roof peak, main entrance, and supporting columns aligned centrally?",
    "explanation": "Image B employs a symmetrical design using colorful geometric patterns. Despite its artistic rendition, the peak roof symmetry is preserved, suggesting that symmetry about the central vertical axis is generally maintained.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the vertical support columns beneath the deck present and positioned at regular intervals along the front facade?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the deck facade and support columns are obscured by geometric patterns, which obscure the regular intervals seen in Image A. The columns don't appear conventionally or prominently, diverging from regular construction positioning.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the small rectangular window located on the lower level, to the left of the main entrance, still present?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lower level is replaced with a geometric pattern that doesn't clearly feature conventional cabin windows, including the small rectangular window seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the stone retaining wall made of large, irregular boulders visible on the right side of the cabin's base?",
    "explanation": "Image B preserves the presence of a stone wall composed of irregular boulders on the right side, reflecting a stylized representation of the stone retaining wall found in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
