    "Question": "Q1: Are there two vertically stacked pancake layers, with the bottom one slightly larger than the top?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon pancakes are illustrated with stacked layers. The visual cues show the pancakes maintaining a cartoonish stack without an apparent size difference between the two layers, which do not indicate a larger bottom layer. Without considering Image A, based solely on Image B, the stack appears uniform, supporting the conclusion that the bottom is not distinctly larger.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is there a solid, rectangular pat of pale yellow butter placed on the top pancake?",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the pancake stack placed on a white plate with a light blue rim?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents the cartoon pancakes and their associated setting without the specific details of a plate, let alone a plate with a light blue rim. The context within the comic portrays them seated on some blue surface, ignoring plate specifics highlighted in the original image.",

    "Question": "Q6: Are the inner sides of the pancakes visibly porous and airy, showing a spongy texture?",

    "answer": "No"
