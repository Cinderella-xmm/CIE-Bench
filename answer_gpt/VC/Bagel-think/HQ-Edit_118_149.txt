    "Question": "Q1: Is the dancer’s left leg extended vertically upward in a full arabesque, with the right foot en pointe?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration shows a dancer on a notebook cover, who appears to have her left leg lifted upward but not in a vertical line. In traditional ballet terms, an arabesque position doesn't typically describe a vertical leg extension but rather a back extension. The term 'full arabesque' suggests a backward extension, but here, the context does not clarify a traditional full arabesque. Therefore, while similar, the description does not fit an exact 'full arabesque' position, and the foot that is raised also complicates whether it is following the exact dance pose. Given this pose doesn't align with a typical arabesque with en pointe, I conclude with: No.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are both feet wearing pink pointe shoes with visible ribbons wrapped around the ankles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration of a dancer shows that she is wearing pink shoes resembling pointe shoes typical in ballet. However, the image does not clearly depict ribbons wrapped around the ankles. Without distinct ribbon details visible, we can't confirm the ribbons, hence the answer must be: No.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Is the dancer’s hair styled into a tight, round bun at the top of her head?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration suggests the dancer's hair is styled into a rounded shape atop her head, which commonly represents a bun style. This is typical for dancers to maintain neatness and uniformity. Based on this clear depiction, I reason it must be: Yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the dancer wear a sleeveless, fitted pink leotard paired with white tights?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is depicted in a pink outfit that seems sleeveless and fits closely, akin to a leotard. Her legs are a different color, resembling the white tights commonly worn with such attire. While the simplified nature of the illustration leaves room for interpretation, the visual similarity suggests: Yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is one arm extended forward and slightly out to the side, while the other grips the barre?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the illustrated dancer is not shown holding a barre, as there is none depicted within the graphic notebook cover art. Her arm positions are stylized, and the absence of the barre makes it impossible to confirm any gripping action. Therefore, I conclude: No.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the dancer facing to the right side of the image, with her body in a side profile view?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's orientation on the notebook cover is not clearly facing the right in a side profile. Instead, the appearance is more stylized and doesn't adhere strictly to left-right traditional profile views. Thus, the context doesn't support a side profile to the right, the answer is: No.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is there a visible seam running down the center back of the leotard?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not provide enough detail of the leotard to discern any seams, particularly down the back. Given the simplicity of the illustration, detailed garment features like seams are missing, so I answer: No.",
    "answer": "No"
