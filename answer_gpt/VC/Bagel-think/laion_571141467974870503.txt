    "Question": "Q1: Is the number '1423' clearly visible on the front of the train?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the train is stylized in a pop art fashion, with bold colors, and lacks finer details like writing or numbers. The graphic design omits certain detailed elements in favor of broader, vivid color sections. Given this stylization, the number '1423' is not clearly visible on the front of the train.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the train have two circular headlights below a central white circular light on its front?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a simplistic, stylized depiction of the train with limited details. The headlights, as specific components like circular shapes or detailed lighting units, are abstracted or omitted in pop art designs. The headlights are represented but they are not detailed enough to match the description of two circular headlights below a central white circular light.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there multiple vertical rows of white-framed windows on the side of the barn?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the barn is presented in vivid, solid colors with minimal or altered detailing due to the pop art style, prominently featuring the color pink for the building. While the building does have white rectangular forms suggesting windows, the defining detail is simplified and lacks exact realism. They suggest multiple rows but not detailed framing because of the stylized depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there two large wooden doors centered on the lower part of the barnâ€™s front facade?",
    "explanation": "The barn in Image B is stylized, showcasing solid colors and abstract details typical of pop art. The prominent color on the barn is pink, and while the form suggests a door outline, it's simplified without the texture or realism found in wooden doors in the original Image A. There aren't detailed 'wooden doors' as such in Image B, due to this stylization.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the railway tracks extend forward from under the train and curve gently to the right into the distance?",
    "explanation": "Image B illustrates the train and tracks with bold visual elements typical of pop art, focusing on straight, abstract representations. The tracks appear exaggerated and simplified with high contrast and lack detailed curvature or distance elements. Thus, any gentle curve to the right seen in Image A isn't depicted here.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the yellow triangular warning sign with a blue border and the '50' speed limit sign visible near the track on the left side?",
    "explanation": "In Image B's stylized depiction, elements like roadside signs are abstracted or omitted for simplicity and artistic expression. The landscape is filled with vivid colors and abstract shapes, but a yellow triangular sign with specific details like a blue border and the '50' speed limit are not explicitly visible.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the train positioned directly on the railway tracks?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the train positioned directly on stylized railway tracks, maintaining alignment with the track's graphic depiction. The pop art style retains key structural alignment, such as the train's placement on the rails, despite abstracted or exaggerated elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
