    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there two vertically stacked pancake layers, with the bottom one slightly larger than the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon pancakes are illustrated with stacked layers. The visual cues show the pancakes maintaining a cartoonish stack without an apparent size difference between the two layers, which do not indicate a larger bottom layer. Without considering Image A, based solely on Image B, the stack appears uniform, supporting the conclusion that the bottom is not distinctly larger.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the pancakes retain a dominant golden-yellow color throughout their visible surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the pancakes are depicted with a consistent golden-yellow hue. This cartoon representation effectively conveys the color typically associated with pancakes, which helps to support the conclusion that they maintain this golden-yellow color throughout.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a solid, rectangular pat of pale yellow butter placed on the top pancake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks a depiction of a solid, rectangular pat of butter. The cartoon pancakes do not have butter on top in the illustration, nor are there visual cues indicating its presence as seen in the comic strip.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible stream of amber-colored syrup flowing from a pitcher onto the pancakes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon pancakes do not show a flow of syrup from a pitcher. Instead, it conveys a character-like appearance without any syrup depicted flowing onto or across these illustrations, maintaining the focus on the pancake's expressions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the pancake stack placed on a white plate with a light blue rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the cartoon pancakes and their associated setting without the specific details of a plate, let alone a plate with a light blue rim. The context within the comic portrays them seated on some blue surface, ignoring plate specifics highlighted in the original image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the inner sides of the pancakes visibly porous and airy, showing a spongy texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the representation of the cartoon pancakes doesn't provide detailed texture or porous attributes. It focuses primarily on expressive cartoon features without illustrating any porous, spongy attributes which would indicate their texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the syrup stream originate from above the stack and flow downward onto the top pancake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals no depiction of a syrup stream originating above or flowing onto the pancake stack. Instead, the cartoon presentation lacks any indication of syrup flowing, focusing on the pancake's character-driven storyline.",
