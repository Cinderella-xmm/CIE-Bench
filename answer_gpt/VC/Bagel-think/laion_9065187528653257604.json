      "question": "Is the \"Indian\" script logo visible and legible on the fuel tank?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is stylized and futuristic, with neon elements framing the motorcycle. The text that might reference an 'Indian' logo is not clearly visible or legible due to the digital and stylized appearance. Logos in stylized or illustrated depictions often prioritize futuristic aesthetic over legibility or brand accuracy. Based on the visual cues and world knowledge about futuristic renderings, the logo visibility is compromised.",

      "question": "Are the engine cylinders arranged in a V-shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a stylized depiction of a motorcycle, where the engine components are simplified and futuristic, primarily focusing on glowing elements rather than realistic details. The key design feature of V-shaped cylinders is obscured by the artwork's stylization. These visual cues indicate no clear V-shape arrangement in this stylized form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there two chrome exhaust pipes running along the right side of the motorcycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle is depicted in a very futuristic and neon style, with glowing elements dominating the framework, and only one part of the muffler or exhaust feature showing futuristic glowing details. There is no clear representation of two chrome exhaust pipes as seen in more realistic depictions.",

      "question": "Is there a black leather seat located above the engine and behind the fuel tank?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the motorcycle appears in a stylized form, with neon and glowing elements where seat materials are not distinctly shown as leather or black. The focus of the depiction lies in the futuristic aesthetic, lacking realistic detailing.",

      "question": "Is the fuel tank white and smooth with rounded contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle's fuel tank is an abstract form glowing with neon outlines, meant to imply a futuristic setting, with a smooth and uniformly white appearance as part of the stylization. The stylized essence highlights smooth and rounded features, fitting the description.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the exhaust pipes connect directly to the engine block?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a futuristic motorcycle with parts displayed in neon rendering, potentially connecting parts such as exhaust pipes. While the pipes are not clearly defined due to the stylized depiction, realistic mechanical connections such as Seams from exhaust to block are obscured in this neon treatment.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the motorcycle have a low-slung, cruiser-style silhouette with a forward-leaning stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle's silhouette is designed in a futuristic, neon-dominated style, which abstractly mimics certain aspects of a cruiser-type shape, such as a low-slung appearance. However, the exaggerated neon elements alter the traditional silhouette making a clear forward-leaning stance difficult to discern distinctly.",
