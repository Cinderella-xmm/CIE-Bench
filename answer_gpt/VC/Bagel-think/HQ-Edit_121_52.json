    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the astronaut's face visible through a clear, circular helmet visor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a cartoon astronaut where the visor is clearly illustrated, allowing a direct view of the character's face. In cartoon illustrations, visors are often depicted as clear to show the character's expression.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a red, white, and blue American flag patch located on the left shoulder of the suit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon astronaut does not have an American flag patch on the suit. The absence of such a detailed design in the cartoon form aligns with the simplification typical in cartoon illustrations.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a large, boxy life-support pack attached to the astronaut’s back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cartoon astronaut with a backpack-like device on their back, which is reminiscent of a life-support pack. In cartoons, such objects are simplified but denote the same function they represent in reality.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible segmented joints at the elbows and knees of the spacesuit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut has smooth lines without visible segmentations at the joints, typical of cartoon styles where such details are often omitted for simplicity.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there visible dust being kicked up from the lunar surface beneath the astronaut’s right boot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any dust beneath the astronaut's boot, a common omission in simplified cartoon settings where dynamic elements like dust may not be depicted.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is a bright, spherical Earth visible in the sky behind the astronaut?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky includes celestial bodies such as planets, but none of them are depicted as Earth. Such stylized backgrounds often aim to provide a fantastical or simplified space theme.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the helmet shaped as a smooth, circular dome with a reflective outer surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The helmet in Image B is depicted as a smooth, circular dome typical of cartoon renderings, but it lacks a reflective surface, which is often not emphasized in animated styles.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
