      "question": "Is the central red rose with green leaves clearly visible on the horse's flank?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is displayed prominently, enclosed in a glass case. On the flank of the horse, there is a colorful design featuring a central red rose surrounded by green leaves, which is clearly visible. The vibrancy and distinctness of the colors in the pattern make the rose stand out clearly. With this analysis, the answer is clear and the central red rose on the horse's flank is visible.",

      "question": "Is the black bridle visible along the horse's face and jawline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examining the horse's face and jawline reveals a visible black bridle. The presence of this bridle is indicated by the dark line extending from the horse's facial area, typical of a bridle used to control or guide a horse. The thorough examination of the image confirms the presence of a black bridle along the horse's face and jawline.",

      "question": "Is the dark tail extending from the rear of the horse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's tail is depicted with a dark color extending from the rear. This is noticeable and distinct from the lighter-colored body, providing contrast that indicates the tail's extension. Analyzing the visual placement confirms the presence of a dark tail extending from the rear of the horse.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the horse's legs and facial area rendered in natural wood grain texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's legs and facial area are visually assessed to determine texture. These areas are clearly depicted with natural wood grain texture, evident from the detailed patterns typical of wood finishes. They display the recognizable characteristics of wood grain, confirming that these areas are rendered as described.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are red roses symmetrically placed on both flanks of the horse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows red roses placed prominently on each flank of the horse. Assessing symmetry involves ensuring both sides mirror each other's design elements. Given the visible patterns on each flank, the red roses appear symmetrically placed given their similar positions and orientations on both sides. Therefore, they are symmetrically placed.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the scene illuminated with warm, golden light creating soft shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering Image B, the lighting within the scene is evaluated. The illumination exhibits characteristics of warm, golden light shown by its hue and reflection on objects like the glass case and wooden walls. The light's direction and intensity create soft shadows around the horse and the surrounding environment. This analysis determines that the scene is indeed illuminated with warm, golden light creating soft shadows.",

      "question": "Are horizontal wooden logs and a stone fireplace with stacked firewood visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals that the background consists primarily of a glass case enclosing the horse, which limits visibility of external features such as wooden logs or a stone fireplace. The clear, unobstructed areas of the image do not show these elements, suggesting they are not visible within this scene.",
      "weight": 2,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The horse in Image B is positioned within a case and is displayed side-on. Its head, alignment, and overall posture indicate that it is directionally facing towards the right side of the image. This assessment draws from the horseâ€™s orientation as captured within the frame.",
