      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image depict exactly eight arms extending from the central head mass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a blue sculpture of an octopus with a shiny finish. Upon counting the arms extending from the central head mass, there are exactly eight. This aligns with the typical anatomical structure of an octopus, which commonly has eight arms. The design is stylized but remains anatomically correct in this regard.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a distinct, rounded central head mass from which all arms originate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the sculpture features a distinct, rounded head mass from which the arms extend. This is characteristic of various octopus species, where the head and arms are clearly defined. The design of the sculpture maintains this feature, presenting an accurate depiction.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the arms exhibit a flowing, undulating arrangement that mirrors the wave patterns of the original ocean scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the arms of the sculpture arranged in a smooth, flowing manner. While they are neatly positioned and appear more static due to the solid material they are made from, they do not exhibit the same dynamic, undulating configuration as the arms of the octopus in the ocean scene of Image A, which are influenced by the motion of the waves.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible surface textures on the sculptures that mimic the original skin's ridges and suction cup patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture in the edited image has a smooth, glossy surface without the detailed textures seen in the natural skin of an octopus. The original octopus displays ridges and suction cups along its arms, features that are not present in the stylized, shiny sculpture, which lacks such realistic texturing.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the sculpture maintain the same general silhouette and proportional relationship between the head and arms as the original octopus?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture in the edited image maintains the general silhouette with a prominent central head and outstretching arms, similar to the original octopus. The proportions between the head and arms appear consistent with the natural anatomy, capturing the essence of the octopus's form, albeit in a simplified stylized manner.",
