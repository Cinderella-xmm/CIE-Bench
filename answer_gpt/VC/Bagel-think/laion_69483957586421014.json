      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the brand name \"WARING\" displayed in bold white capital letters on a black rectangular plaque with a textured border?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'WARNG' is displayed in bold black letters on the box packaging, rather than in white on a black plaque like in Image A. World knowledge about branding helps infer that such a display on packaging is typical for highlighting the brand, but the edited version does not match the description as the color and logo styling differ.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the control buttons labeled \"OFF\" (red), \"ON\" (green), and \"PULSE\" (blue) arranged horizontally on the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the packaging suggests the arrangement of 'OFF', 'ON', and 'PULSE' buttons, through an illustration. World knowledge suggests kitchen appliances often have such an arrangement for user functionality, but upon comparing with Image A, this description fits the actual appliance rather than packaging, indicating Image B is more illustrative for comparison.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the processing bowl have a black handle attached to its left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging prominently displays an image of a food processor which appears to have a handle attached to its left side. World knowledge about product packaging and appliance design suggests displaying realistic features and functionality. This matches with Image A, where the appliance has a visible black handle on the left side of the bowl.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a transparent lid covering the bowl with a vertical feed tube and a pusher mechanism visible at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's packaging shows a food processor with features including a transparent lid and an upward-extending component that resembles a feed tube and pusher. Such designs are common to allow ingredient insertion and safety. Comparing with Image A, these elements suggest the usual design presence on the food processor.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the feed tube a tall, vertical cylinder extending upward from the center of the lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, on the packaging, seems to indicate a feed tube placed off-center, not directly from the center of the lid. World knowledge of blender design usually implies central feed tubes for efficiency, but the depiction in Image B leans towards non-central placement compared to Image A, confirming its variation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the base of the food processor silver metallic with black feet at the bottom corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction and description on the packaging suggest a silver metallic base with black fixtures or feet at corners. Kitchen appliance design commonly uses such color schemes for modern aesthetic appeal and sturdiness, which aligns with what Image A shows clearly on the actual appliance, confirming the description.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the food processor maintain the same proportional relationship between the base, bowl, and feed tube as shown in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustrated proportions on the packaging might appear slightly altered, showcasing parts separately for clarity, which can differ from real-life proportions due to illustrative needs. Comparing to Image A, the real appliance maintains true physical proportion, indicating a difference from the illustrative representation.",
