        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the painting above the sofa clearly shows a scene with trees in orange and yellow hues lining a river, with the sun setting in the background.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a sofa that has several cushions in beige, along with one prominent cushion in a yellow tone. This matches the description of having beige cushions with a yellow accent pillow, as these visual details are clearly noticeable.",

      "question": "Is the sofa still positioned directly below the wall painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spatial arrangement shows the sofa is placed directly below the painting on the wall. The sofa's position aligns properly beneath the center of the painting, indicating that the sofa is indeed directly below the painting. This conclusion is drawn by observing the vertical alignment in the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting in the room is consistent with natural light entering from the right, as indicated by the direction of shadows cast on the wall and floor. The presence of light on that side leads to the deduction that illumination is from natural sources coming from the right.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a floor that has the characteristic appearance of a light herringbone pattern, evident from the distinct angular arrangement of the floorboards. This visual pattern aligns with the description of a light herringbone-patterned flooring.",
