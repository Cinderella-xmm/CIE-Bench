    "Question": "Q1: Is the central character (derived from the green block) positioned exactly in the middle of the composition, surrounded by other characters?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central character is not positioned exactly in the middle of the composition as the figure is shown positioned lower than the central point of the image amidst a decorative array of hearts. The key object in the middle is surrounded by hearts in different colors and sizes, but not other characters resembling blocks.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the characters derived from the blocks retain the circular stud pattern on their upper surfaces?",
    "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B do not show characters derived from blocks maintaining the circular stud patterns. Instead, the visible elements are heart-shaped objects, which show no signs of the stud pattern typical to Lego-type blocks.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the characters derived from the blocks primarily composed of rectangular or boxy shapes, preserving the original block geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the composition's primary elements are heart shapes rather than rectangular or boxy shapes that resemble blocks. The elements are rounded and not indicative of preserving original block geometry.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the composition filled with a dense cluster of characters (originally blocks), arranged in a piled, overlapping manner?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases a neatly arranged layout rather than a densely filled cluster of characters. The hearts are spaced apart and do not demonstrate a piled or overlapping manner typical of a collection of stacked blocks.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there only one character (derived from the green block) that differs in color or design from the surrounding characters?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure noticeably differs in terms of character design, being a toy-like figure among heart shapes, but speaking solely of color and design difference, there's no single green block-like character distinctly differing from a cluster when considering their appearance as characters.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the characters derived from the blocks retain any visual indication of interlocking mechanisms (such as recessed areas or connectors)?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not present any visible signs of interlocking mechanisms commonly found in blocks such as recessed areas or connectors. The composition largely consists of individual heart shapes scattered around, none of which display any block-like connectors.",
    "answer": "No"
