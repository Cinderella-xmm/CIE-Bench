      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the red eye lenses present in the head of the robot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's head is visible, but the eyes are not prominently highlighted with red lenses. The details of the head show a visor that may suggest eye location, yet lacks distinct red coloring seen in typical red eye lenses. Without any glow or specific color marking indicating the presence of red lenses, we conclude this detail is not visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there three orange circular thruster nozzles on each foot of the robot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feet of the robot display features that should be inspected for thruster nozzles. The rear area of each foot shows a pattern with orange sections resembling thruster nozzles, indicating three circular structures on each foot consistent with typical mecha designs.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is a long, straight sword being held in the robot’s left hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot is holding a weapon in its left hand, which should be assessed for being a sword. Observing the visual cues confirms it as a straight sword due to its elongation and linear shape, typical of sword designs and held by the robot in a carrying position.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there two wing-like structures on the back of the robot, each with an orange tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the robot with two prominent structures extending from its back, resembling wings. Each of these structures has an orange-colored tip, matching common mecha aesthetic designs where functional wings have accent colors.",

      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The right hand of the robot in Image B is seen carrying an elongated weapon. By analyzing the length and shape, it corresponds with what a rifle looks like, fitting the expected form of a long firearm held in a mecha's grip.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the robot primarily colored in gray and white with orange accent markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall color palette of the robot in Image B is dominated by shades of gray and white. Additional details in the image show orange markings, which are often used in mecha designs as accent colors to contrast the neutral primary tones.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stance of the robot in Image B shows a symmetrical pose with legs equally bent in a standing position. Such posture does not indicate one leg bent forward and the other backward, typical of a static display rather than dynamic forward motion.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the text \"©SOTSU·SUNRISE\" visible in the bottom-left corner of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, scrutiny of the bottom-left corner reveals no presence of the text '©SOTSU·SUNRISE', which may appear in official materials but is absent. Instead, other text likely from the backdrop is visible.",
