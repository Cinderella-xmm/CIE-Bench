        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top part of the parking meter has a circular label with the word 'PARKING' clearly printed. The sunlight seems to highlight this part, making the text easy to read. The design and placement of the label are typical of parking meters, enhancing readability.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a sticker on the front of the parking meter displaying text. Upon close observation, the text 'ComsiAcara' is clearly visible on the sticker.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the parking meter mounted atop a pole with its base visible at the bottom, indicating it is properly installed. Its alignment with the vertical pole beneath suggests that the meter is securely attached and standing upright, which is common for such installations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of bright sunlight positioned behind the parking meter would typically create a shadow. However, the edited environment and lighting conditions obscure any visible shadow directly beneath the meter. Thus, there is no clearly visible shadow in this image.",
