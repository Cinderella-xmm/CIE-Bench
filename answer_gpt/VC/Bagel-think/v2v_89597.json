      "question": "Is the central touchscreen still positioned in the center of the dashboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image uses abstract art styles or techniques that make it difficult to decipher specific object details precisely. However, based on the overall composition and familiar structure, one can identify that there is an object located centrally, which in the context of a car dashboard, logically corresponds likely to the touchscreen. Hence, despite the abstract representation, the touchscreen can be inferred to be centrally positioned.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dashboard retain its general structure and placement relative to the steering wheel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts black strokes in a coherent manner that suggests the horizontal alignment and structure of the dashboard relative to the steering wheel area shown on the left. Even if abstract, the elements such as horizontal bars and curved structures provide context consistent with typical dashboard design in vehicles.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the steering wheel still partially visible on the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, abstract strokes depict a circular structure on the left, which is indicative of where the steering wheel would be located in a vehicle. This alignment corresponds to the steering wheel’s partial visibility in its logical place on the dashboard's left side, as suggested by the layout of the strokes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the overall spatial arrangement of the vehicle's interior remain consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, despite its abstract nature, retains recognizable elements and positions, such as the central screen and left-side steering area, that are consistent with Image A’s spatial layout. The dashboard, its horizontal layering, and relative positioning of components maintain a logical spatial coherence reflective of vehicle interiors.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the airflow graphics on the screen still discernible, even if represented through calligraphic strokes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the calligraphic strokes on the central screen mimic a visual pattern suggesting airflow, consistent with a typical airflow graphic found on car display screens. While abstract, the strokes can reasonably be interpreted as representations of airflow. However, whether they are discernible with clarity or not as airflow specifically is visually challenging given the abstraction.",
