      "question": "Is the crisscross lattice pattern of pastry strips visible on the pie's surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pie's surface features a checked pattern, which is a crisscross texture typical in latticework. However, it appears more like a cartoon depiction of a lattice, with less distinct strips than a real pie. This suggests the editing process transformed the realistic lattice pattern into a stylized cartoon interpretation, which still retains the general idea of a crisscross pattern.",

      "question": "Is the knife with a metallic blade and wooden handle clearly present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knife is visible with a metallic blade and a wooden handle, similar to a typical kitchen knife design. Even in the cartoon format, the characteristics of the knife remain recognizable. The detail of the wooden handle and metallic blade aligns with the kitchen utensil depicted in Image A.",

      "question": "Is a fine dusting of white powdered sugar visible on the surface of the pie, particularly over the lattice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible fine dusting of white powdered sugar on the pie's surface. The pie takes on a cartoon format, which simplifies the details, including omitting the powdered sugar that was present in Image A. The pie has a uniform look without any such embellishment, suggesting that this edit simplified the appearance for stylization.",

      "question": "Is the pie crust uniformly golden brown in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pie crust is depicted in a cartoon style with a golden brown color visually simplified across its surface. This coloring reflects the typical portrayal of a baked pie crust in illustrations. The uniformity of the cartoon golden brown color suggests that the edit maintained the uniform tone of the crust from Image A.",

      "question": "Are dark red sections of fruit filling visible through the gaps in the lattice crust?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no dark red sections of fruit filling visible. The pie is depicted in a simplified cartoon style, with no gaps or fillings 'seeping' through, contrasting with Image A's realistic rendition where the filling is clearly visible. This change indicates that the detail of the fruit filling was removed in the cartoon edit.",
