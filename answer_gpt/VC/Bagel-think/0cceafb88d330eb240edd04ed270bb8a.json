      "question": "Is the pomegranate present and clearly identifiable as a red, round fruit with visible internal seeds, held in the hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a round fruit is held in the left hand. The fruit is red with a small stem-like protrusion, resembling a pomegranate, however, it doesn't visibly show internal seeds in this depiction. World knowledge informs us that pomegranates often have visible seeds when sliced. The lack of visible seeds suggests limited identification detail for this fruit compared to common representations.",
