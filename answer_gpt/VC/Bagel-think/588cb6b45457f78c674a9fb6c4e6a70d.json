    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes positioned symmetrically within the face, with a slight upward slant at the outer edges and gazing directly forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The second image shows a blurred face, so the eyes are not visible. Analyzing only the unblurred elements, such as the face's surroundings, doesn't provide information about eye positioning. Therefore, it's not possible to assess eye symmetry or gaze direction.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the nose have a straight bridge and a slightly rounded tip, aligned centrally between the eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face in the edited image is blurred, leaving the nose undiscernible, preventing an accurate analysis of its shape or alignment. Thus, there can be no confirmation of a straight bridge or its central alignment.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the lips thin, closed, and slightly upturned at the corners, forming a neutral yet thoughtful expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the face being blurred in the edited image, features such as lips cannot be evaluated for their shape or expression. Hence, it is not possible to confirm the lips' appearance or positioning.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the face proportionally balanced, with equal spacing between the eyes and symmetrical distribution of facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features are obscured by blurring in the edited image, making it impossible to verify the proportional balance or symmetrical feature distribution.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the left ear partially visible, emerging from under the hair near the temple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited imageâ€™s face area is blurred, with no distinguishable features, including the ears, therefore making it impossible to determine the visibility of the left ear.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there soft shadows along the right side of the face and under the jawline, created by directional lighting from the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face's blurred nature in the second image prevents the observation of shadows or lighting effects normally visible on facial contours.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the head centered above the shoulders, with no unnatural tilt or rotation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the face being blurred, the outline of the head does appear to be centered above the shoulders without a noticeable tilt or rotation, based on the position of the hat and shoulders.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
