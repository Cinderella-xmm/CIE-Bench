      "question": "Is the subject's skin tone still dark brown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject appears to be an angelic figure with a gown. The skin tone visual cues suggest a lighter complexion, which is a significant change from a dark brown skin tone. The visible parts like hands and arms appear to be of a lighter shade. Therefore, the judgment is based on the visual difference in skin color observed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the subjectâ€™s head tilted upward with her gaze directed toward the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of the subject's body and head does not seem to indicate an upward tilt toward the sky. The subject maintains a more forward angle, commonly used in portrayals of celestial beings, which suggests a neutral or horizontal orientation.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject exhibits an angelic pose with both arms outstretched to the sides. The palms facing forward are common in depictions of benevolence or welcome, which is consistent with the features shown in the image.",

      "question": "Does the subject have braided hair, even if stylized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject does not display braided hair. The hair is curly and flowing, more akin to traditional artistic depictions of angels, contrasting with a stylized braided hairstyle.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the garment's lower portion is depicted in a flowing manner, but not necessarily flaring outward to suggest motion like in an active dance or twirl. The drapery is elegant and static, fitting a serene rather than dynamic posture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the expression does not suggest a visible smile as there are no indicators of teeth being shown. The overall facial features align with an expressionless or serene look typical of angelic depictions.",
