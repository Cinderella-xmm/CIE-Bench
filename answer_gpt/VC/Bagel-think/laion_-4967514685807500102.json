      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the shrimp rendered in a pink-orange color consistent with cooked shrimp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shrimp are illustrated in a cartoon style and have an orange color. Cooked shrimp are typically pinkish-orange, so the artistic rendering is aligned with the typical appearance of cooked shrimp, using common sense understanding of color representations in food illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there visible red spice coating on the shrimp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shrimp are depicted in a comical cartoon comic style. There are no visual cues indicating any red spice coating on the shrimp themselves; rather, the comic elements and expressions dominate the design. The presence of red elements seems more related to the comic's color scheme than food seasoning.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there yellow lemon wedges with visible rind and pulp in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible yellow lemon wedges with rind and pulp. The focus is on a cartoon shrimp character within a comic strip, and it does not include elements like lemon wedges typically associated with food plating.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there finely chopped green herbs visible on and around the shrimp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a chibi-style comic strip with shrimp characters. While there is green on the shrimp, it appears more stylized as decoration rather than resembling finely chopped herbs typically used in culinary presentations.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shrimp maintain a curled, C-shaped form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shrimp are rendered as cartoon characters with varied expressions and poses. They do not maintain a consistent curled, C-shaped form like real cooked shrimp, instead adopting anthropomorphic poses as part of the comic's humor elements.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the stainless steel pan with rivets present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B is a cartoon comic strip featuring stylized shrimp characters and does not include a depiction of a stainless steel pan with rivets, which is typically a photographic or realistic detail related to cooking imagery as seen in Image A.",
