      "question": "Is the infinity pool's edge still visible and defining the boundary between the water and the surrounding landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the infinity pool's edge, although transformed into a sculptural form, remains visibly distinct from the surrounding stone relief. It creates a clear boundary mimicking the water's edge in Image A, demonstrating the separation between the pool area and the relief design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is represented as a carved figure in a central position relative to the sculpted pool edge, akin to her position in Image A, where she is naturally leaning on the poolâ€™s edge. This maintains her original orientation.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background has been entirely transformed into a stone relief art scene, featuring various figures and plant elements. The traditional-style buildings from Image A are not represented or integrated into the relief design in Image B.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a clear lighting effect, highlighted on the stone relief elements, which maintains the bright atmosphere seen in Image A, resembling a sunny day without the direct sunlight seen in open spaces but giving clarity and brightness to the relief design.",
