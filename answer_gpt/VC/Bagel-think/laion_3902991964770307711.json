      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain exactly three arms—one central and two lateral—arranged symmetrically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a candelabrum with three arms arranged symmetrically. One arm is in the center, and two laterally extend from it, forming a typical symmetrical layout often seen in candelabrums. This is confirmed by the visual cues showing equal spacing and identical shaping of the arms around the central axis.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the left and right arms symmetrically positioned and shaped relative to the central axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left and right arms of the candelabrum appear balanced and evenly spaced on either side of the central stem. This symmetry is evident from their identical curves and lengths, and the precise alignment reflects typical manufacturing for such objects where symmetry is a key design element.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the base circular, flared, and adorned with a beaded or ridged edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a candelabrum with a base that is circular in shape; however, it does not show any noticeable flare feature nor intricate bead or ridge designs on the edge. It seems more streamlined with a plain, metallic finish compared to elaborate designs sometimes seen in traditional alternatives.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the central stem remain a tall, tapering vertical shaft connecting the base to the top arms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central stem is not tall nor tapering; it instead appears stout and cylindrical with floral engravings, differing from conventional tall and tapering shafts typically found in candelabrums meant to visually elevate the arms significantly above the base.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the arms maintain smooth, curved trajectories from the central stem to the top ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the two lateral arms of the candelabrum extending outward in smooth, curved lines that gradually rise to meet their respective holders. This rounded trajectory from the central point is intentional for aesthetic balance and functional design, common in such objects to hold candles.",
