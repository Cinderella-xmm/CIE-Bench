      "question": "Does the creature retain a translucent, vivid green material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature is depicted as a stylized 2D illustration with a solid green color. Unlike the original jelly-like translucent appearance of the gummy bear in Image A, the illustration in Image B does not convey any translucency. It is a solid drawing that lacks the material texture seen in the original photo.",

      "question": "Does the creature maintain a rounded form and whimsical vibe reminiscent of a gummy bear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the creature is designed with rounded features and a whimsical appearance. In Image A, the object is a gummy bear with a cute, rounded form typical of gelatin candies boasting playful vibes. Image B illustrates a cartoonish bear with exaggerated roundness and child-like features, maintaining the whimsical feel.",

      "question": "Is the creature still placed on a black plate with scattered colorful petals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon bear is not depicted on any plate, nor are there any colorful petals scattered around it, unlike Image A, where the bear is placed on a black plate surrounded by petals, enhancing the aesthetic. This shows that the background and plate elements have been altered in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the creature positioned centrally on the plate, similar to the original gummy bear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B doesn't depict the creature on a plate, there is no central positioning related to a plate. In Image A, the gummy bear is indeed centrally placed on a black plate, but this setup is not present in the edited image.",

      "question": "Does the image retain a neutral, textured background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is plain and untextured, serving as a simple backdrop for the cartoon bear. Image A displays a neutral, slightly textured background complementing the plate and gummy bear setup. Therefore, the background has not been retained in the edited image.",
