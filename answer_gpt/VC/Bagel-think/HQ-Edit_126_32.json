      "question": "Are the two small human figures visible beneath the tree in the same relative position as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, an additional object, a humanoid figure, occupies the center-left portion of the image where the tree was in Image A. The edited image does not feature the tree seen in Image A, nor do the two small human figures visible beneath the tree. Therefore, the relative position of human figures beneath the tree cannot be observed or compared since they are absent in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the horizon line present and continuous across the entire width of the image, separating the field from the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horizon line is visible and creates a division between the sky and the expanse of the field, similar to Image A. The horizonal division appears to be continuous across the image's width, maintaining a visual separation between the two major sections of the landscape.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sky retain the gradient transition from pale blue near the horizon to deeper teal at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky exhibits a gradient transition where the color shifts from a pale blue near the horizon upward to a richer teal tone at the top, consistent with the gradients observed in Image A. This gradient creates a vivid backdrop in both images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the foreground composed of tall grass with a mix of green and golden-yellow hues, extending toward the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground consists of tall grass that mixes green and golden-yellow colors. This grassy field extends toward the central figure, akin to the field extending toward the tree seen in Image A. Despite the change in focus, the composition and hues of the grassy foreground remain consistent.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the tree located in the center-right portion of the image, dominating the right half of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain a tree; instead, a humanoid, alien-like entity occupies the left-central part of the frame. Therefore, unlike Image A, where the tree dominates the center-right area, Image B lacks this tree, making it impossible for it to dominate the right half of the frame.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a subtle shadow cast beneath the tree, indicating directional lighting from the upper left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a humanoid figure without a tree, so there is no shadow cast beneath a tree. Without a tree in the edited image, any previous shadow indication is absent. Therefore, the directional lighting effect cannot be observed as it was beneath the tree in Image A.",
