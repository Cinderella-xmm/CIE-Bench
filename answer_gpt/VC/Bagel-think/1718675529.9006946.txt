    "Question": "Q1: Are ocean waves present and breaking onto the sandy shore?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ocean is stylized into flat, segmented shapes without fluid motion or breaking waves, which would usually be depicted as curved and textured in a more realistic style. Based on common representations of waves, this image does not convey inherent movement or breakage of waves onto the shore as seen in natural settings.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the sandy beach present and curving from the foreground toward the right side of the image?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a stylized depiction of a beach with geometric shapes representing the shore. The lines and angle of these shapes give a sense of curvature leading towards the right. Applying knowledge about shorelines, the planar segments in the image imply a curving shore direction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are palm trees visible along the coastline on the right side of the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are stylized elements that resemble tall, linear forms with canopies at the top. Known patterns of palm trees can be understood from these triangular shapes along the right side of the image. These elements align with simplified graphic depictions commonly used in art for palm trees.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there three distinct rock formations visible in the foreground sand, clustered together near the right side?",
    "explanation": "While Image B showcases angular shapes in the foreground, these are not distinct rock formations clustered together as one might see in a realistic photograph. Instead, they appear more as abstract elements inconsistent with realistic depictions of rocks.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are footprints and ripple patterns visible in the wet sand near the waterâ€™s edge?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not contain detailed textures or patterns that one would associate with footprints or sand ripples. Its flat and stylized approach lacks the necessary detail to depict such features. Footprints and ripples are absent due to the minimalistic style used.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the coastline visible as a curved line extending into the distance, with green hills rising behind it?",
    "explanation": "The described elements in Image B are heavily abstracted. Although the segmental shapes suggest some extension into the distance, they do not detail hills or a clear coastline in context with hills behind. The abstraction does not capture recognizable green hills rising behind a coastline.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the sky visible above the horizon, featuring clouds with warm orange and pink tones near the horizon and transitioning to blue higher up?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is abstractly represented with large color blocks that do not show cloud formations or gradients typical of skies transitioning from horizon to zenith. Hence, the specific color tones and gradations described are not present in terms of warm tones transitioning into blue.",
    "answer": "No"
