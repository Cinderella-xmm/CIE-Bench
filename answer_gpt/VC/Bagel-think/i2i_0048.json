      "question": "Does the zebra retain its black-and-white stripe pattern without significant alteration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra clearly exhibits the same black-and-white stripe pattern characteristic of zebras. Although the overall color contrast in the image may have been enhanced, causing the stripes to appear slightly more pronounced, the fundamental pattern of alternating black and white stripes remains unchanged from a structural standpoint. Therefore, there is no significant alteration to the zebra's stripe pattern.",

      "question": "Is the zebra still in its original standing posture facing slightly towards the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the zebra appears to be in a standing posture with its body facing slightly to the right. This matches the typical natural posture zebras take, where their side profiles are visible. Without any indications of a change in direction or posture, the zebra's stance is consistent with the original scene's position.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the second zebra partially visible behind the first one, preserving its placement in the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a partially visible second zebra behind the first zebra. This indicates that the position of the second zebra is the same relative to the first, as seen in the composition of the scene. The visibility is consistent with a scenario where one animal is slightly obstructed by another, suggesting the placement has been preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the image still feature a grassy savannah background with some scattered vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B shows a typical grassy savannah landscape with scattered vegetation, which is characterized by a flat grassy area interspersed with some bushes or trees. The enhancement in color contrast might have made the greenery more vivid, but the essential elements of a savannah are clearly present, consistent with the original environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the zebras' relative sizes, proportions, and perspectives maintained as seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras appear to maintain their logical sizes, proportions, and perspectives relative to each other and to the environment as expected within a natural scene. These aspects remain consistent with a photographic representation of animals in their habitat, showing no apparent manipulation that would alter these elements.",
