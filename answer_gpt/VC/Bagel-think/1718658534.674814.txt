    "Question": "Q1: Is the dorsal ridge composed of a series of raised, looped structures running along the back of the pig?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dorsal ridge of the pig appears to be made of rounded, raised structures that run along its back. These structures don't seem to be looped but are more like individual, smooth, raised segments, similar to carved patterns commonly found in wooden sculptures. Therefore, based on the visual characteristics and the common stylistic elements used in carvings, these do not form looped structures like in the knitted version of Image A.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the tail extend from the rear of the pig and terminate in a fluffy pom-pom?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tail of the pig is visible at the rear end, and it doesnâ€™t end in something that looks fluffy but rather a carved section that follows the wooden pattern of the rest of the sculpture. Wood generally cannot have features like a fluffy pom-pom due to its solid nature, hence it is unlikely to have a fluffy appearance.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there four short legs attached beneath the body, two on each side?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the pig having four distinct short legs, two on each side of its body which is typical for both real pigs and pig sculptures. These are clearly designed to support the body, consistent with common figurine designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a rounded snout extending forward from the face of the pig?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the wooden pig does have a rounded protrusion which serves as the snout. Pigs, whether real or in artistic representations, often have rounded snouts. The wooden material, though offering a polished look, replicates this rounded feature.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there two small, upright ears positioned on the top of the head?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays two small upright ears at the top of the head of the pig sculpture. These ears are more defined due to the sculptural nature, consistent with both typical pig anatomy and artistic renditions of pigs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
