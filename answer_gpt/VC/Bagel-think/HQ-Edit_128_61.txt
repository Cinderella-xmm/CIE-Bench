    "Question": "Q1: Is the vessel positioned in the center of the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the vessel appears to be a decorative, bejeweled container rather than a simple vessel. It is positioned closer to the right side of the image rather than centered.

}

    "Question": "Q2: Is there a circular tray directly beneath the vessel?",

    "Question": "Q3: Does vapor or smoke originate from the top opening of the vessel?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a bright, luminous silhouette emerging from the container, resembling the appearance of vapor or smoke, but it is more defined and shaped like a figure. This suggests that some form of mystical or magical essence is emanating rather than simple smoke.",

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the vessel have a conical or upward-tapering shape?",

}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a small opening at the top of the vessel?",
    "explanation": "The vessel in Image B does not have a small, defined opening at the top. Instead, the top part is more of a decorative, jewel-encrusted design with no distinctly visible small aperture that resembles an opening.",

}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the tray made of a material visually similar to the vessel (e.g., terracotta)?",
