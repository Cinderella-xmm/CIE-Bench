      "question": "Does the clock tower retain its hexagonal shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock tower is depicted with a distinct hexagonal structure, as evidenced by the angular edges and consistent shape surrounding the clock face and extending upwards to the roof. Understanding architectural designs, many traditional clock towers have hexagonal or octagonal shapes for aesthetic and structural purposes. The visual cues from Image B affirm that this shape has been retained.",

      "question": "Is the clock face still present with Roman numerals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a circular clock face positioned centrally on the tower with Roman numerals (I to XII) clearly visible, which are traditionally used for clock faces to give a classic and timeless appearance. Observing these details confirms that the clock face with Roman numerals is still present.",

      "question": "Does the tower still have a balcony with balusters below the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a balcony shown below the clock face, characterized by a series of closely spaced vertical components, known as balusters. These are ornamental posts often used in architectural designs for both structural and decorative purposes, confirming the presence of the balcony with balusters.",

      "question": "Does the tower retain its pointed roof structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the tower with a pointed roof structure, as evident from the narrowing shape leading to a peak at the top. This type of roof is typical in clock towers to prevent water accumulation and to provide an aesthetically pleasing finish. The depicted shape confirms the retention of the pointed roof.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the tower retain its green and yellow color scheme, excluding the flags?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the tower primarily in green, with some accents that might appear altered due to snow coverage. However, previous non-snow areas in Image A were green and yellow, implying that under the snow, the color scheme likely remained unchanged. Therefore, considering the snow and potential original design, the green and yellow appearance is likely to still be present.",
