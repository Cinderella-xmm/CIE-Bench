      "question": "Does the image retain the baby elephant's wrinkled gray skin texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the baby elephant is visible with its familiar wrinkled gray skin. Elephants, particularly baby ones, are known for their distinctively textured skin.

      "question": "Is the baby elephant depicted with small ears compared to its body size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the baby elephant's ears appear proportionally small compared to the rest of its body. Elephant calves generally have smaller ears compared to fully grown elephants, which is depicted in this image. Thus, the appearance of small ears in relation to the elephant's body size is consistent with expectations.",

      "question": "Does the baby elephant retain a short trunk in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The baby elephant in Image B maintains a short trunk, which is typical for young elephants before they grow into their fully matured appearance. This is a characteristic feature of elephant calves, and the edited image maintains this depiction.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the blue metal bars, which are vertical and form part of the background structure. They are distinct and noticeable behind the baby elephant, indicating that this element remains unchanged in the edited version.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground on which the baby elephant stands appears to be covered in a reddish dirt. This suggests that the ground's coloration is consistent with earthy tones often found in environments like zoos or animal enclosures, and matches the initial depiction.",
