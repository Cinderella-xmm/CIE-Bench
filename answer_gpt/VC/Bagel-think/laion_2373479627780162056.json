    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the subject’s beard and mustache present and white in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the style and color present in the beard suggest a representation of facial hair. Typically, in illustrations or painting portrayals that echo real life, there is an effort to match the natural color of facial hair. In this image, the lighter coloration likely represents white facial hair, which is consistent with stylized portrayals involving elder subjects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the subject have short, graying white hair with a visible receding hairline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hair is depicted through artistic illustration techniques that often emphasize characteristics like receding hairlines and gray hair to reflect age realism in artwork. The colors used in the hair region denote aging, such as the transition to gray or white.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the subject’s mouth slightly open, indicating speech?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central part of the face is not visible, leaving no visual cues that could suggest the mouth's position or suggest speech. Therefore, it's not possible to discern whether the mouth is open.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the subject wearing a dark suit jacket over a white dress shirt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays clothing depicted in contrasting colors consistent with formal attire. The jacket is given a darker hue typical of formal suits, and there is contrasting use of color under the jacket indicative of a formal shirt. This type of attire implies that the jacket is dark and the shirt white.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a tie visible at the neck, knotted in standard fashion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tie is represented using lines of patterns typically associated with traditional ties, including depth and knot forms consistent with standard knots. Even though the illustration style abstracts from reality, the depiction corresponds with the standard fashion of ties.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the subject’s eyes positioned symmetrically, with visible wrinkles around them, and a prominent nose and jawline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a stylized depiction of facial features. The use of patterns around presumed eye areas often attempts to give depth and show symmetry, akin to portraying human faces in artwork. Therefore, while lacking explicit features such as wrinkles, the depicted structure likely suggests such attributes commonly shown in face illustrations.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the face illuminated from the front-right, casting subtle shadows on the left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In artwork like Image B, shadowing is indeed used to infer lighting sources even if the depiction is abstract. The shading effects on one side of the clothing provide cues that light might be sourced from a specific direction. With lighter tones on one side, it denotes possible illumination from a direction, such as the front-right.",
