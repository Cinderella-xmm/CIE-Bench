      "question": "Does the edited image retain the deep, blocky lug pattern of the tire treads?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there is no visible depiction of tires or a lug pattern. Instead, the image contains a robot-like creature with an insectoid appearance, featuring smooth and rounded textures. The concept of tire treads, especially deep and blocky lug patterns associated with off-road tires, is absent. By analyzing the design and details of the robot, we can determine there is nothing resembling a tire tread pattern.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the embossed text \"ROCKS TIRE\" and \"SUPER SWAMPER\" visible on the sidewalls of the tires?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts a fictional robotic creature, and there are no tires present. Consequently, there is no sidewall to examine for any text. The visual cues, such as the composition and materials, focus on creating a robotic, possibly extraterrestrial being rather than any automotive components. This understanding reflects that no tire sidewall text is possible.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the five-spoke designs of the wheel hubs still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the subject is a robot that lacks any wheels or wheel hub designs. The visual elements are focused on the limbs and body of this robotic creature, which do not include any typical tire or wheel features like a five-spoke hub. Therefore, there is no evidence of such a design feature in this altered context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the matte, rubber-textured surface of the tires maintained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a robotic creature, not a tire. While the creature may have a textured surface akin to certain synthetic materials, it doesn't exhibit the precise matte, rubbery texture that one would identify with a tire. Instead, the visual texture is focused on achieving a mechanical, possibly metallic look with synthetic elements, suggesting that the tire texture is not present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the tread blocks evenly spaced and proportionally consistent with the original tires?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "This edited image does not include tires or tread blocks. Instead, it features a fictional robotic creature, with aesthetics that do not incorporate any tread block patterns or even spacing typical to tire designs. Therefore, the concept of tread blocks being evenly spaced or proportionally consistent doesn't apply.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the edited image contain exactly four tires, corresponding to the original stack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there are no tires present at all. The original object, a stack of tires, has been replaced with a singular robotic creature. This change in the object count and type indicates that the condition of having four tires is not applicable or present in this context.",
