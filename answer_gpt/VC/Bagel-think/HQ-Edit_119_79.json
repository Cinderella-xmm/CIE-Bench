      "question": "Is the calico pattern of orange, black, and white patches preserved in the same spatial arrangement across the catâ€™s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's body is represented with segments of crystal-like substances, exhibiting a stylized and geometric appearance. The natural calico pattern, which typically consists of patches of orange, black, and white in various irregular shapes and arrangements, is not preserved in its original form. Instead, the geometric crystal segments mimic some color arrangements superficially but do not maintain the same spatial arrangement as a natural calico pattern. Hence, the answer is no.",

      "question": "Are the eyes still green and positioned symmetrically in the center of the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes remain green and are positioned symmetrically on the face, maintaining the cat-like appearance. The symmetrical positioning aligns with common depictions of anthropomorphized animals, which often retain basic anatomical accuracy in their stylization.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cat in an upright seated position with both front paws placed directly in front of the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is depicted in an upright seated position, similar to Image A. However, due to the transformation into a crystal-like form, the front paws are stylized into geometrical shapes but are still placed in a position that would correspond to being in front of the body if interpreted in a stylized manner. This suggests an upright seated position, consistent with traditional depictions of a cat sitting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the pink nose present at the center of the face, surrounded by white fur on the muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the geometric and crystal style of the representation is prominent, the nose is rendered in a greenish crystalline form rather than pink. The surrounding area lacks the typical white fur directly due to the crystal aesthetic. Hence, the features do not match the description of a pink nose with white fur.",

      "question": "Is the cat seated on a vertical wooden block that supports its full weight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the transformation to a crystalline structure, the cat retains a position atop a wooden block similar to Image A. The block continues to serve as the base for the sculpture, consistent with the support necessary for any form depicted as 'sitting.' Thus, the cat is displayed as being seated on the block, suggesting support for its presence there.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the tail curled to the right side and displaying alternating orange and black bands consistent with the body pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tail is part of the overall crystalline structure, and while the coloration in the segmented form may hint subtly at past colors, it does not mirror the specific patterning of orange and black bands seen in natural calico cat tails due to its stylization and abstraction. Therefore, the exact banding and position are not maintained as described.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Are both ears upright and pointed forward, symmetrically placed on the top of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's ears are represented as part of the crystal structure and remain upright and pointed forward, similar to how they are typically shown in cat illustrations, and are symmetrically located at the top of the head. The transformation into crystals doesn't alter their fundamental placement or general orientation.",

      "question": "Is there a large white fluffy area on the chest extending from the neck down to the front paws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area that would conventionally be a 'fluffy chest' is transformed into a smooth crystal surface. While it retains some design continuity with lighter shades potentially indicative of what was once 'white fur,' the textures and specific fluffy appearance of natural fur are lost; hence, the characteristic is significantly altered in this type of artistic representation.",
