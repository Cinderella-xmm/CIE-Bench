    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the butterfly’s four-winged structure with two large upper wings and two smaller lower wings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly structure can be observed clearly. The butterfly has two upper wings that are larger in size and two smaller lower wings. This is a typical characteristic of butterflies and is maintained in this representation, indicating the four-winged structure is preserved.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the butterfly depicted with symmetrical wings on both sides?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's wings appear to be symmetrical with respect to its body. Each side mirrors the other in shape and size, consistent with the natural anatomy of butterflies, which generally feature symmetrical wing designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a visible central body connecting the wings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central body of the butterfly can be observed connecting the wings on either side. This central body often serves as the main attachment point for the wings, both physically and visually, maintaining structural coherence in butterfly design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a loop or attachment point at the top of the butterfly’s head?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a butterfly with a loop that appears to be an extension above the central body, which can be interpreted as an attachment point typically used for hanging or wearing the butterfly in jewelry designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the butterfly positioned with wings fully spread in a flat, horizontal orientation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is depicted with its wings open in a manner that appears predominantly flat and horizontal. This positioning allows for a full display of both the intricate wing pattern and overall butterfly shape.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the wings proportionally larger than the body, matching the original scale?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wings are visually prominent and larger compared to the central body of the butterfly. This large wing-to-body ratio is consistent with typical butterfly morphology and seems to match the expected proportion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do the upper wings have a pointed tip and curved outer edge?",
    "explanation": "Examining Image B reveals that the upper wings of the butterfly indeed have pointed tips and a curved outer edge, a common characteristic of many butterflies in both artistic and realistic depictions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Are the lower wings visibly smaller and more rounded than the upper wings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lower wings of the butterfly can be observed as being smaller and possessing a more rounded shape when compared to the upper wings. This feature contributes to the distinct quadrilateral structure of butterfly wings.",
    "answer": "Yes"
