      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car appears to have a prominent three-pointed star emblem on its front grille, consistent with branding elements commonly found on Mercedes-Benz vehicles. The presence of similar design cues supports the conclusion that the emblem is indeed present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car features characteristic gullwing doors that open upward from the roofline. The hinges located at the top, allowing the doors to swing upward, are evident. This design is synonymous with vehicles like the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the car lacking a vertical slit-shaped air intake that is typically present on such cars. Instead, a smooth surface is seen where this intake might normally be, suggesting the absence of the feature.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display the 'SLS' badge near the rear wheel arch, as this detail appears to be omitted or not accentuated in the edited representation. The badge is typically a key identifier in such vehicle models.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels shown are of a five-spoke design, differing slightly from the multi-spoke pattern expected. The pattern type supports the conclusion that they deviate from a multi-spoke design.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the depiction in Image B, the interior seats appear to be presented in white. While explicit material identification from an image is challenging, the smooth texture and coloration suggest a leather-like appearance, aligning with luxury car interior designs.",
