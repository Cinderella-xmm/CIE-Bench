    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the overall shape of each earring a symmetrical, elongated feather with pointed tips at both ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual elements suggest a cartoon depiction rather than actual earrings. The objects resemble stylized birds or creatures with feather-like elements, suggesting a playful character design rather than realistic jewelry. Based on common sense, earrings typically have detailed metallic designs, whereas the edited image lacks such detail, focusing instead on an animated style. Therefore, the depicted elements do not resemble symmetrical, elongated feathers with pointed tips at both ends as seen in typical jewelry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does each earring contain a centrally located oval black stone set within a metallic bezel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beings are colorful, cartoonish characters without any detailed depiction of jewelry elements like stones. The creatures do not resemble items with a central black stone or a metallic bezel, as there are no indications of traditional earring components. Rather, the illustration features simplified, graphic shapes typical of cartoon illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there fine, parallel engraved lines extending outward from the central spine on both sides of the feather?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoon style of Image B lacks any engraved lines indicative of detailed craftsmanship. Such fine details are typical of realistic jewelry design but are not present in the edited artistic representation, which seems to focus on colorful and simplistic shapes instead.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the metal of the earrings rendered in a silver tone with a matte or slightly oxidized (antiqued) finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the graphic design employs bright, vibrant colors, contrasting with the silver tone or antiqued finish typical of jewelry. This depiction is consistent with cartoon illustrations where color is used for emphasis, rather than realistic texture or finish.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does each earring include a curved hook earwire connected via a small spherical bead to the main feather body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible earwires or spherical beads. The illustration focuses on character design, typical of cartoon art, which does not incorporate detailed jewelry components like hooks or beads.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the two earrings identical in shape, size, and orientation, mirrored across a vertical axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two cartoon characters rather than mirrored earrings. Each character appears different in posture and design, which contradicts the notion of mirrored jewelry. The playful and colorful design does not convey identical shapes or sizes typical of matched earring sets.",
