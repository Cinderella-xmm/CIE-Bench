    {

      "question": "Are both feet positioned en pointe, with the right foot slightly ahead of the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the sculpture's feet are flat on the ground, and they are not positioned en pointe as in a ballet pose. This is typical of classical sculptures that depict standing figures. In contrast, dancers en pointe typically show a strong vertical alignment with the feet extended, which is not the case here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both arms extended laterally from the body, with palms facing inward and fingers gently curved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The statue has its arms extended outward from its sides, but they are not fully extended laterally or horizontally. The right arm is bent slightly downward and outward from the body. The hands are sculpted to reflect classical artistic poses rather than a natural palm-inward ballet position.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the head turned to the left, with the chin slightly raised?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture's head appears to be turned to its left, consistent with many classical sculptures wherein the head might have a slight tilt or turn to convey motion or expression.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the legs fully extended and aligned vertically, with the spine slightly arched backward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the sculpture, the legs are solidly positioned but not in a fully extended or vertical position associated with ballet dancers. Furthermore, there is no evident backward arch of the spine, which is often depicted with more dynamic postures.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the arms positioned at approximately hip level, extending outward from the sides of the torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In this image, the statue's arms extend more naturally outward from its torsos, characteristic of many classical sculptures with relaxed yet poised positioning, but they are not at hip level.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the upper body slightly tilted forward while maintaining vertical alignment through the spine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture presents a typical upright posture. There is a graceful standing position without much tilt forward or backward, maintaining the vertical axis alignment, consistent with classic sculpture stances.",
