    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the semi-circular arrangement of seating?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the seating area is depicted as several continuous curved lines that resemble a semi-circular pattern. This representation reflects the seating arrangement typical in an amphitheater, where seats are arranged in a semi-circular fashion to face a stage or central performance area.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the edited image retain the tiered wall with arches?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a simplified design that includes tiers and a repeated pattern of arches. The depiction of multiple rows of arches matches the original function of providing structural support and aesthetic appeal in historical amphitheater architecture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the edited image maintain the relationship between the seating and the stage area?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lower part with the circular stage-like design is adjacent to the semi-circular seating area, replicating the spatial relationship where seating surrounds a central stage, typical of amphitheater designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the edited image retain the even spacing of the arches?",
    "explanation": "Image B illustrates arches spaced evenly across different tiers of the structure, maintaining a consistent pattern that mimics the architectural symmetry seen in amphitheaters. The repeated arch motif suggests uniform spacing.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the edited image retain the overall shape and outline of the amphitheater?",
    "explanation": "Image B appears to condense the essential features of an amphitheater, including its curved walls and tiered arches. Despite being stylized, it preserves the overall recognizable form of the amphitheater as a structure with a semi-circular seating arrangement and a curved outer wall.",
    "answer": "Yes"
