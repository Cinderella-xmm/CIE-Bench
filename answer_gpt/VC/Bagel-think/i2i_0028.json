        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration style shows the woman with a pronounced winking eye and a smile, which is a typical feature in such cartoon-like representations that indicates happiness or friendliness.

      "question": "Are there exactly three teddy bears, each with a distinct red shirt containing a blessing text?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, three teddy bears are visible, each wearing a red shirt. However, instead of readable text, these shirts contain artistic scribbles resembling text, which is typical in stylized or illustrative art to imply writing without providing specific words. Despite this, it represents the concept of text on clothing.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artistic style clearly outlines the woman seated on a couch holding three teddy bears positioned in front of her. This indicates that in the edited version, just like in the original photo, the woman is depicted with the teddy bears prominently displayed before her.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a checkered black-and-white jacket. Instead, the woman is illustrated with minimal detail, typical of simple or cartoon-like art, where clothing details are often not elaborated or stylized differently from real-life depictions.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background comprises a plain and minimalist style, common in illustrative art. The focus is on the woman and the teddy bears, with a simple couch featured as the main surrounding. There is no detailed depiction of a beige wall or a striped blanket, indicating a departure from the original's simplicity.",
