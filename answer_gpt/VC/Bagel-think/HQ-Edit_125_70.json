      "question": "Is the chisel with a long straight steel shaft and wooden handle still present in the same shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a tool resembling a chisel with a long straight shaft and oval handle is visible on the pegboard. Its characteristics suggest a steel shaft and wooden handle, typical of chisels. Comparing this to Image A, the same chisel is present in the same shape and position. By analyzing the shape and position of the tools, we can conclude they are the same.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible gouge with a curved cutting edge and oval handle. Gouges typically have a specific shape that allows for curved cuts into wood, which is currently unidentifiable in Image B when compared to Image A.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a hammer positioned on the workbench, maintaining its clawed end and metal head design. The hammer's appearance suggests it retains these characteristics. Image A provides the same view, confirming it retains the original shape in Image B.",
