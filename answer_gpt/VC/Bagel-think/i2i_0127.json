      "question": "Is the toilet still predominantly white in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toilet appears to be predominantly white based on the visible portions of the toilet bowl, tank, and lid, which are consistent in appearance with a standard white toilet. The decorative text added on the wall does not impact the color of the toilet itself. Thus, based on the visual information, the toilet remains predominantly white.",

      "question": "Is the toilet lid still open?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toilet lid is visibly open, exposing the inside of the toilet bowl. This is determined by observing the raised lid against the wall and the visible interior ring of the toilet bowl. This observation aligns with a common open-lid appearance for toilets.",

      "question": "Is the flush tank still attached to the wall above the toilet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toilet's flush tank is directly positioned above the toilet bowl and appears to be attached to the wall behind the toilet. The flush tank is a standard feature in most toilets, often located immediately above the bowl to facilitate gravity-assisted flushing. Therefore, the flush tank is still attached to the wall above the toilet.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the walls and floor are visibly covered with gray square tiles. Despite the presence of overlaid text in some areas, the underlying tile pattern is still discernible. These tiles are consistent in appearance with typical ceramic or stone tiles used in bathrooms, suggesting continuity in the tiling from Image A to Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual positioning of the toilet against two tiled walls indicates that it remains situated in the corner of the room. The layout showcases common bathroom design wherein toilets are often fitted into corners for space efficiency, thus confirming the toilet's corner position.",
