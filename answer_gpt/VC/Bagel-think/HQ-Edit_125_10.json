      "question": "Is the dragon-headed prow with detailed carvings and open jaws present at the front of the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a Viking ship model where the prow features a dragon head design, characterized by detailed carvings and open jaws. These visual attributes are commonly associated with historical representations of Viking ships known for their intricately carved dragon heads at the front. Thus, using common knowledge about Viking ships and analyzing the visual elements, the answer can be concluded.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dark red and black circular knotwork emblem centered on the beige sail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sail does not have the dark red and black circular knotwork emblem centered on it. Instead, the sail features grid-like lines without any bold, circular emblem that would reflect knotwork patterns. Analysis of the visible sail design leads to the conclusion that the emblem described is absent.",

    {

      "question": "Are multiple circular shields with distinct symbols mounted along the side of the ship beneath the oars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows circular shields mounted along the side of the ship. These shields have distinct symbols, commonly used for decorative purposes or indicating heraldry on Viking ships, positioned between the hull and the oars. The visual representation aligns with historical depictions of Viking ships, aiding in affirming their presence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there multiple oars extending outward from the hull, each connected to a small human-like figure representing a rower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several oars extend outward from the ship's hull, but they do not appear directly connected to human-like figures as rowers inside the ship. Instead, an army of toy or miniature warriors is shown at the front, unrelated to the oar positions. Given the absence of the described rower-and-oar connection, this depiction negates the question's scenario.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hull consist of clearly defined horizontal wooden planks with visible grain and layered construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hull of the ship in Image B is made up of horizontal wooden planks. These planks are visibly layered and show noticeable wood grain, indicating traditional wooden ship construction methods. The visual clues clearly depict layered planks as opposed to a smooth surface, which assists in confirming the construction style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a single central mast supporting a square-shaped sail that is fully unfurled and attached via ropes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship model displays a central mast supporting a square-shaped sail that is unfurled and attached via ropes, reflecting the typical sail layout and rigging for Viking ships. This traditional design, with its square sail, is visualized through the clearly observable arrangement of the mast and sail positioning.",
