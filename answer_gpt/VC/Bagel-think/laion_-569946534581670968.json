      "question": "Is the golden-brown color present on the plush chicken wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the plush objects that resemble chicken wings are predominantly orange in color, which lacks the variation seen in real grilled or fried chicken wings. Combining this visual information with world knowledge about typical chicken wing coloring, it is clear that these do not exhibit the golden-brown hues typically found in cooked chicken wings. Thus, the answer is No.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the plush chicken wings shaped like real chicken wings, including distinct drumettes and flats?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows that the plush objects mimic the general shape of chicken wings but do not have distinct sections such as drumettes and flats. Real chicken wings have anatomical segments, which these plush items don't distinctly represent. Therefore, based on the visual cues and typical chicken wing structure, the answer is No.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examining the placement and geometry of objects, the white bowl is positioned slightly away from the center and towards the bottom right part of a square plate. When considering the bottom right as the area of focus on this square plate, the answer is Yes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a small bowl filled with a material that is consistent with a bright orange color. Given the clear visibility of this color and the knowledge that orange is a distinguishable hue, it can be confirmed that the object inside the bowl is bright orange. Thus, the answer is Yes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, there are eight plush objects designed to look like chicken wings on the plate. This count is below ten, showing that the number is not approximate to ten. Utilizing arithmetic and visual inspection to judge quantity, the answer is No.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the spatial arrangement of the objects in Image B, the bowl is distinctly placed towards the bottom right area of the plate. Considering 'near' in relative terms regarding the plate's geometry and the item's proximity, the answer is Yes.",
