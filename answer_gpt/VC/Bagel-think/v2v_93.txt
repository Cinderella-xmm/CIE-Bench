    "Question": "Q1: Does the thermometer retain its circular shape and metallic rim?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the thermometer appears circular and has a rim that visually resembles metal. This is inferred from the shiny, smooth texture and the characteristic reflective quality common to metal objects. The circular shape and metallic aspect are typical for thermometers of this type.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the temperature scale markings (-2째C to 200째C) clearly visible?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a temperature scale that ranges from -2째C to 200째C, with increments marked clearly. The numbers and lines are bold and distinct, allowing for easy reading, which is a standard feature for analog thermometers to ensure accurate temperature readings.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the needle present and positioned correctly relative to the temperature scale?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the needle is present and positioned. It aligns with the scale markings, pointing to a specific temperature, which is crucial for indicating the temperature reading. This alignment suggests the needle is correctly positioned for functional usage.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the text 'TEMPERATURE' still visible in the center of the thermometer?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the text 'TEMPERATURE' prominently displayed in the center area of the thermometer. This label is essential for indicating the purpose and parameter that the device is measuring. The visibility of this text suggests that Image B retains the informative aspect of the thermometer.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the thermometer retain a white face for clear visibility of the markings?",
    "explanation": "The face of the thermometer in Image B remains white, providing high contrast for the black temperature markings and text. This design choice is common in analog thermometers to ensure that readings are easily legible against the bright background.",
    "answer": "Yes"
