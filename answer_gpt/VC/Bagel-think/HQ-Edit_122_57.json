      "question": "Is the vase's overall shape preserved, including its three-panel body, twin scrolled handles, and flared neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is primarily glass-like with a rounded body and lacks the distinct features of a three-panel body, twin scrolled handles, and a flared neck. The vase does not have any pronounced handles, and its design is simple and elegant, contrasting with the ornate patterns and complex shape expected from a description of multiple panels and scrolled handles. Based on this analysis, the answer is no.",

      "question": "Does the bouquet extend beyond the rim of the vase, creating an overflowing effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bouquet in Image B consists of crystal or glass-like flowers that do extend upward beyond the rim of the vase. This design gives the visual impression of a bouquet growing and expanding outward from the vase, similar to an overflowing effect. Thus, the visual cues suggest the flowers are arranged in a way that clears the vase's rim, fulfilling an overflowing effect.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there scattered flowers on the surface of the pedestal, including at least one pink poppy and blue blooms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design is neat and organized, with no scattered flowers on the pedestal surface itself. The vase and bouquet are entirely made of crystal or glass. There are no real flowers depicted, and thus, no pink poppy or blue blooms are scattered on the pedestal based on the visual analysis.",

      "question": "Is the vase positioned centrally on the pedestal within the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vase in Image B is positioned centrally within the frame, resting on a pedestal or base. The symmetrical arrangement of the vase within the image frame suggests a central positioning. The visual cues indicate it's positioned evenly at the center, both horizontally and vertically, on a base.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do some of the flowers rest directly on the surface of the pedestal, separate from the main bouquet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all elements of the bouquet are elevated and integrated into the design of the crystal or glass decor. None of the flowers or floral elements can be seen resting directly on the surface of the pedestal, as the entire arrangement is contained and elevated above the base. This supports the understanding that no detached flowers are present on the pedestal.",
