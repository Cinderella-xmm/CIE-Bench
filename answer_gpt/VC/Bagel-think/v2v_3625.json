      "question": "Does the edited image retain the representation of a navigational tool (map)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual aspects resemble a colorful mosaic pattern with multicolored sections and intricate designs. While it doesn't literally depict a standard map, one could infer with some imagination that the mosaic pattern mimics the general complexity and structure of a map. However, without clear geographic or cartographic features, it's challenging to definitively classify it as retaining the representation of a map. Common sense and knowledge about navigational tools would suggest that a true map has identifiable geographic regions, which this mosaic does not distinctly replicate.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there identifiable markers (pins) indicating specific locations/routes on the map?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are distinct objects shaped and colored like traditional push pins (blue, yellow, red, and green) which stand upright on the surface that appears to mimic a map. These objects serve as markers suggesting they are used to indicate specific places or points in a traditional map-reading context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a visible hand interacting with the map, specifically placing a marker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a hand is visibly engaged with the surface, holding a red pin. The grip and position of the fingers suggest an action associated with placing a marker, a common activity in interacting with maps to denote a location of interest.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the markers (pins) visibly connected, suggesting a planned route?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colored pins are not visibly connected by any lines or strings that explicitly indicate a path or route. Despite their presence, there is no visible indication of interconnection among them to suggest a planned route as one might expect in a map-based context.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the wooden surface and the beige sweater sleeve as part of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual scene retains the presence of a sleeve, which appears to be made of a similarly colored material as a beige sweater, visible on the arm interacting with the board. Also, the background beside the mosaic-like surface appears wooden, maintaining the same context of a table or surface as in a typical household or office environment.",
