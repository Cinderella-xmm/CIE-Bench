      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the facial expressions and details are intentionally obscured, preventing direct observation of any facial expressions or details such as the mouth being open. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the mouth is wide open in a roaring expression with visible teeth and tongue.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the facial features, including the eyes, are blurred. Thus, there is no way to ascertain if the eyes are narrowed and focused to indicate anger or exertion.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, while the faces are blurred, the hairline is not clearly visible enough to determine if there is a balding crown with hair along the sides and back. Given the available information, it's not possible to identify the hair pattern.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the blurring effect on the face impacts the visibility of the jawline and chin. Without clear visibility, itâ€™s difficult to determine if the jawline is strong and angular with a defined chin.",
