      "question": "Is the pyramid visible in the background to the right of the Sphinx, with a clear triangular silhouette against the sunset sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a pyramid can be seen in the background to the right of the Sphinx. Its silhouette is clearly triangular and stands out against the bright hues of the sunset sky. This observation is consistent with the typical scenery of the Sphinx and pyramids in Egypt.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the sun positioned low on the horizon, directly behind the Sphinx, emitting a bright circular glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows the sun positioned low on the horizon, directly behind the Sphinx, and it is emitting a bright circular glow. This placement accentuates the Sphinx's profile against the vivid colors of the setting sun, in line with typical sunset imagery.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a dense layer of clouds below the Sphinx, appearing illuminated with orange and pink hues from the sunset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Below the Sphinx in Image B, there is a prominent layer of clouds. The clouds appear dense and are illuminated with orange and pink hues, likely reflecting the colors of the sunset. This is characteristic of sunset scenes where clouds catch the sunlight.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the Sphinx facing toward the right side of the image, with its profile visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Sphinx in Image B is oriented with its face towards the right side of the image. Its profile is visible, which is a common depiction in images of the Sphinx, where it faces East in real life.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the sky show a smooth gradient from warm orange near the horizon to cooler purple and pink tones at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the image, the sky exhibits a gradient effect, starting from warm orange tones near the horizon and transitioning to cooler pink and purple tones towards the top. Such a gradient is typical in sunset images, contributing to the atmospheric effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible horizontal erosion lines and layered textures on the lower portion of the Sphinx’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lower portion of the Sphinx’s body in Image B shows horizontal lines and textures that resemble erosion patterns. These features are typically present on the real Sphinx due to weathering and contribute to its ancient appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there sand visible around the base of the Sphinx, particularly near the front paws and lower body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no sand is visible around the base of the Sphinx. The lower region is dominated by clouds rather than the expected sandy ground that would typically be seen around the base of the Sphinx.",
