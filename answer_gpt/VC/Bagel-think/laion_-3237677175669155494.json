      "question": "Is the Elizabeth Tower positioned on the right side of the image with a tall, vertical structure topped by a pointed spire and a clock face near the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Elizabeth Tower (commonly known as Big Ben) is positioned on the right side and indeed remains a tall vertical structure. It has a clock face near its top and a pointed spire, although the tower appears to be reimagined with futuristic elements and elaborate decorations, such as mechanical details and vines. These stylistic changes do not alter its fundamental structure as a tower with a pointed spire and clock face.",

      "question": "Does the building complex on the left side of the image have multiple pointed Gothic spires and a long horizontal facade with repeating arched windows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building complex on the left maintains its architectural style characteristic of the Houses of Parliament, featuring multiple pointed Gothic spires and a long horizontal facade with repeating arched windows. These elements are consistent with the original architectural style of the complex seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Is there a red double-decker bus labeled with route number 53 traveling across the bridge from left to right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a red vehicle resembling a double-decker bus on the left side of the bridge. However, it is highly stylized with exaggerated, futuristic features and glowing elements, which may distort its inscription details. Assuming such artistic alterations, the route number on the bus is not visibly legible or clearly marked as '53' due to the design transformation, differentiating it from the clear '53' in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bridge structure extends across the image with consistent green metal railings and a paved roadway visible from left to right. The original elements, such as the bridge railings and roadway layout from Image A, remain largely unchanged aside from the thematic alterations in the image.",

      "question": "Is the text “BUS LANE” clearly visible in white lettering on the road surface near the right edge of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, 'BUS LANE' text is discernible on the road surface toward the right edge of the image. Despite the stylistic enhancements in the artwork and unique features throughout the image, this detail remains intact and visible like in Image A.",

      "question": "Are there people visible walking on the sidewalk on the right side of the bridge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus has shifted towards a fantastical design with increased sci-fi elements. While in Image A, people are visible on the right sidewalk, Image B primarily features altered surroundings, but people seem less of a focus and are not clearly visible, making it difficult to confirm their presence literally.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, another red double-decker bus is positioned further down the road towards the right side. It does maintain an ordinary double-decker bus appearance despite the image’s futuristic theme, but the distinctive route number, ‘43,’ from Image A is not prominently visible due to the enhanced artistic features and embellishments in Image B.",
