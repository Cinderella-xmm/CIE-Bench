      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the curved contour of the fairway, leading from the foreground toward the green, preserved in its original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the image is stylized using geometric shapes and colorful blocks, making it difficult to identify specific shapes and contours typical of a fairway. The artistic transformation abstracts the scene rather than preserving natural forms. Image A shows a typical fairway with a distinct contour towards the green. Comparing both, Image B does not maintain this specific realistic contour.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sand bunkers located in their original positions along the fairway, particularly near the green and on the left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has an abstract representation where the details about the sand bunkers are not distinct and are represented by generalized shapes and colors. In Image A, sand bunkers are clearly identifiable near the green and on the left side. Given the abstraction, Image B does not accurately reflect the original positions of sand bunkers.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the water hazard present in the foreground, directly bordering the fairway, and reflecting the sky and structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts an abstract version of the water hazard using colorful geometric shapes, which do not represent realistic reflections of the sky and structures. In Image A, the water hazard is a clear representation of a body of water reflecting its surroundings. The abstraction in Image B does not preserve the original characteristic reflections.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the AT&T GOLF tower and the white event tents located in the right midground, adjacent to the spectator area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B abstracts the scene without clearly differentiating between specific towers or event tents recognizable from a realistic perspective. Image A shows the AT&T GOLF tower and event tents, but this specific arrangement is lost in the abstraction of Image B. Therefore, they are not identifiable in a way similar to Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the green area elevated at the back, forming a slight incline from the fairway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The representation in Image B is abstract and does not display any elevation changes or realistic topography. Image A shows a green area with an elevation change forming an incline. In Image B, this natural characteristic is not depicted, as geometric abstraction alters the landscape's interpretation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a dense group of spectators visible along the edge of the fairway, especially near the green?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses abstract figures to depict people, aligning them approximately along the edge of the fairway similarly to Image A. While stylistically different, the crowd's presence and grouping persist in a similar layout as exhibited in Image A where spectators are aligned densely near the green.",
