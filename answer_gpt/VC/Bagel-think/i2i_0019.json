      "question": "Does the figurine retain the elephant's large ears and trunk as part of its general silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine displays a distinguishable silhouette related to an elephant, characterized by its prominent, large ears and a long trunk. These features are key identifiers of an elephant and are necessary to maintain the likeness of the animal in a figurine representation. The retention of these features is clear in the figurine, as its design prominently includes an extended trunk reaching downward and noticeably large ears relative to its head size, common features of an elephant's silhouette.",

      "question": "Is the chibi figurine depicted holding grass with its trunk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine is shown with a depiction of grass within its trunk, which curls upwards, indicating that it's holding grass. This reflects an accurate representation of an elephant's behavior, as elephants commonly use their trunks to grasp and manipulate objects, including food like grass. The clarity with which the grass is shown being held by the trunk supports this depiction.",

      "question": "Does the figurine's surface include a subtle representation of the elephant's wrinkled skin texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a figurine whose surface is carefully crafted to mimic the texture typical of an elephant's skin. Elephants are known for their notably wrinkled and rugged skin, and the figurine's design includes creases and lines that emulate this characteristic texture. Although the representation isn't as detailed as a real elephant, the design intention to capture this feature is noticeable.",

      "question": "Does the figurine maintain the elephantâ€™s grey body color and brownish ear tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B is painted primarily in shades of grey, consistent with an elephant's typical body color. The ears on the figurine display a slightly different tone, a brownish hue, which is occasionally observed in real elephants where dust or dirt may adhere. This coloring aligns closely with the natural coloration of elephants as seen in photo-representations of them.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the inscription around the base of the figurine reads 'Bertvel Parek', not 'Jungle Friend'. This is a clear observation from the visual cues provided in the image, where the text is directly viewable and distinctly stated. Therefore, the phrase 'Jungle Friend' is not part of the engraving.",
