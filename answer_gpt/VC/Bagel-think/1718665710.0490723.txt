    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the curly, voluminous dark brown hair with visible wave patterns?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image (keychain version), the hair appears to be simplified and stylized due to the keychain's design. The original curly, voluminous nature and wave patterns found in natural hair are typically minimized to fit the aesthetic style of a chibi keychain. Therefore, while some representation of the hair is present, it does not maintain the same detailed curly or wave patterns as seen in a realistic depiction.",
