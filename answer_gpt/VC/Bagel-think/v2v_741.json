      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's attire comprises a top that predominantly features purple and white colors.

      "question": "Is the text \"XML Application Platform xfy\" present on the character's design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted in front of a purple background that partially displays the words 'XML', 'Application', and 'Platform'. However, the text does not fully display 'xfy'. This suggests that the text 'XML Application Platform xfy' is only partially visible. Despite the presence of some words, the complete phrase is not visible on the character's design.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character and the notebook-like object behind have a visual element on the left which resembles a spiral binding. This binding is a common feature in notebooks, involving a series of loops or rings holding the pages or layers together.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted holding an object that resembles a black wireless mouse in her hand. Earlier logic suggests that such an object is typically recognized as a peripheral device for computers, commonly black in color and wireless.",
