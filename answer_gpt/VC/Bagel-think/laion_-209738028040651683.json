    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the almond-shaped eyes with visible dark eyeliner and defined lashes present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face details are blurred, making it impossible to accurately determine the shape of the eyes or any makeup such as eyeliner or lashes. Therefore, the almond-shaped eyes with dark eyeliner and defined lashes cannot be confirmed as present.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the woman smiling with visible upper teeth in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurred section of Image B obscures the facial expressions, including any smile or showing of teeth. Given this blurring, the woman's smile and visible upper teeth cannot be perceived.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the nose with a straight bridge and rounded tip present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the blurred facial region in Image B, details about the nose, such as the bridge or tip shape, are not visible. Consequently, determining the presence of a straight bridge and rounded tip is not feasible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the woman have light skin with a warm undertone in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the visible skin tone of the woman's neck and arms suggests light skin with a warm undertone. This conclusion is drawn from the discernible hue and the common color palette associated with warm undertones.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the woman's body silhouette consistent with the original — upright, slender build, and proportional limbs — in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's posture is upright, and her build appears slender with proportional limbs. This observation is similar to Image A where the body's silhouette appears consistent with these attributes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is a silver necklace with a small pendant visible around the woman’s neck in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a visible necklace that is gold in tone rather than silver, with a visible pendant. Given the necklace’s appearance in Image B, the original description is inaccurate.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the woman’s dark brown hair visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's hair appears gray or platinum blonde rather than dark brown based on visible cues in the color and styling. This indicates a difference in appearance between Image A and Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
