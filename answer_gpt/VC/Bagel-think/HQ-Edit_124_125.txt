    "Question": "Q1: Is the subject’s left leg raised and held behind her back with both hands?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are not holding their left leg with both hands behind their back as the question describes. Based on the visual cues, each subject has one hand raised in a circular motion or the arm is placed to the side, which indicates a balanced yoga stance but does not show the hands actively engaged with the leg. This suggests that the question's reference to the subject raising and holding their left leg with both hands is not applicable to Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the sun located directly behind the subject’s torso, forming a halo-like glow around her silhouette?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, each figure is positioned with the sun in the backdrop behind their torso, illuminating their silhouette and creating a glow that resembles a halo effect. The position and the overall scene set on a beach subtly enhance this glowing effect due to the sun's prominent placement. This aligns with the description provided in the question.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the beach surface visibly wet, showing reflections of the sun and ocean waves?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the beach surface does reflect the light suggesting it might be slightly wet, as indicated by the shine visible around the subjects. However, due to the nature of the images presented on the book cover, detailed reflections of the sun and ocean waves as per the description are not distinctly visible.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there two distinct rocky landforms visible in the background, one on the left and one on the right side of the frame?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows ocean views behind the figures, which include visible rocky landforms on either side of each panel. These could be characterized as distant rock formations making each scene unique and framing the subject. This suggests that there are indeed rocky forms on both sides of each frame.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the subject standing barefoot on the sand, with the sole of her right foot flat against the ground?",
    "explanation": "Each illustration in Image B shows the yoga positions being executed on a flat surface potentially of sand. The figures appear to be performing the act barefooted and it shows a flatfoot stance in most positions shown on the book cover, aligning with the scenario described.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the subject’s hair tied into a neat bun at the back of her head?",
    "explanation": "Every depicted subject in Image B appears to have their hair styled into a tidy bun located at the rear of the head, suggesting a poised presentation customary in yoga practice. This is evident from the various angles illustrated that offer a clear view of the hairstyle.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the subject’s head tilted upward, with her face angled toward the sky?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's head is tilted in various yoga stances; however, in the majority of detailed images her head is not shown distinctively angled towards the sky in every position. Hence, the question does not align distinctly with the presentation of all shown poses.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Are there visible ocean waves breaking along the shoreline in front of the subject?",
    "explanation": "Image B, acting as a backdrop to each pose, indeed shows the ocean behind the subjects, complete with breaking waves. These are illustrated as curled shapes near the beach, displaying subtle interactions with the shoreline, which supports the claim made in the question.",
    "answer": "Yes"
