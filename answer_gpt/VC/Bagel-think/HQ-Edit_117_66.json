    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there exactly four dragons, one in each quadrant of the cover?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, there are indeed four dragons featured on the cover, and each dragon is located in a distinct quadrant. The presence of their serpentine shapes and stylistic features such as scales or claws gives the impression of four dragon figures distributed evenly across the four quadrants surrounding the central circular feature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a central circular compass composed of concentric rings with inscribed characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central circular element resembles a compass with a detailed structure composed of concentric rings, and there appear to be characters inscribed within these rings, which are faint but discernible. The arrangement of the rings with inscriptions fits the description of a compass-like design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a star-shaped pointer located at the center of the compass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central point of the compass in Image B is marked by a prominent star-shaped feature, indicative of a navigational pointer typically found in compass designs, suggesting its function as a central reference. The star shape is clearly portrayed and is central to the compass design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the dragons arranged symmetrically around the central compass, with each facing toward the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragons are positioned symmetrically around the central compass, and each appears oriented toward the middle, as evidenced by their curving forms that lead the observer's eye toward the central point. This suggests intentional symmetry in their arrangement relative to the compass.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the dragons separated by cross-shaped lines dividing the cover into four equal quadrants?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features cross-shaped lines that segment the cover into four quadrants, within which the dragons are placed. These lines create a clear separation between each section, supporting the design choice of equal partitioning.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there Chinese characters inscribed within the concentric rings of the central compass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the detail is less pronounced, there are inscriptions within the concentric rings of the compass. These inscriptions have the appearance of characters, possibly similar to Chinese characters, given their arrangement and complexity within the rings.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the dragons have coiled bodies with raised heads and extended claws, consistent with traditional Chinese dragon depictions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dragons in Image B exhibit characteristics associated with traditional Chinese dragon art, such as coiled, serpent-like bodies and raised heads, with the suggestion of claws extended toward the center. This depiction is consistent with typical representations found in Eastern art, reinforcing the theme of traditional dragon symbolism.",
