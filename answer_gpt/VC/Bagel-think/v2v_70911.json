      "question": "Is the AXE logo still visible on the container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a galaxy or nebula pattern with what appears to be a distorted or partially visible AXE logo. Although it is not as clear as in Image A, the visual cues suggest that the logo is still partially visible upon focusing on the top left corner of the color pattern. Therefore, combining the visual information with common knowledge of where logos are typically placed on items, the answer is yes, the logo is still visible.",

      "question": "Does the container retain its cylindrical shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the container appears irregular and jagged, as if it has been creatively edited to look torn or damaged, while the rest of the container maintains its regular curved shape. A comparison with Image A shows a complete, regular-shaped container. As Image B has a disrupted shape, the reasoning here considers the overall perception of shape retention as being cylindrical or not. The answer is No, the container does not retain its complete cylindrical shape.",

      "question": "Are the fiery red and energetic pink hues from the label's explosive design still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the label features a nebula design dominated by blue, purple, and pink tones with a galaxy pattern but lacks the fiery red and pink explosive design present in Image A. Comparing both images, it's clear that the specific hues mentioned have been replaced by the vibrant nebula imagery. Thus, using visual cues and color identification, the answer is No, those specific hues are not present.",

      "question": "Is the net weight text (\"NET WT 2.64 OZ (75g)\") still visible on the label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the label shows a nebula design and any text, particularly the net weight information seen in Image A, is not visible. A detailed comparison reveals that the region in Image B where the text might be found is covered with a nebula image, completely obscuring the text. This leads to the conclusion, based on the altered visibility, that the net weight text is not visible.",

      "question": "Is the container depicted as mostly intact, with only a crack allowing the nebula to be seen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a large 'tear' effect at the top of the container, which disrupts the intactness. The nebula is not seen through a mere crack but rather as a part of the label's design, covering a significant area. Comparison to Image A, which shows an entirely intact container, indicates a major difference. The reasoning indicates that the design intent seems more stylistic than depicting a minor crack. Therefore, the container is not mostly intact.",
