      "question": "Is the central figure depicted in a bent-forward pose with one arm raised and the other supporting the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the posture of the central figure in Image B, the figure is clearly shown in a bent-forward pose with one arm raised and the other seemingly supporting the body. This can be inferred from the way the body is positioned and the orientation of the arms. This depiction remains consistent regardless of the edit applied to the image. My conclusion is based solely on the observable posture in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is there a circular emblem with wavy internal lines located on the chest of the central figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the central figure has a circular emblem with wavy internal lines on its chest. This is seen as a distinct feature in the chest region that stands out due to the colors used in the edit. These wavy lines within the circular emblem are an unmistakable part of the design.",

      "question": "Is the central figure enclosed within a diamond-shaped geometric frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure is surrounded by various geometric patterns. However, these do not form a complete diamond-shaped frame. The framing around the central figure is more complex and does not conform to a simple diamond shape. Thus, despite the vibrant and intricate patterns, the specific arrangement does not create a diamond frame.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a floral motif located in the top-left corner of the design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination of the top-left corner in Image B, among various artistic elements and patterns, there is indeed a floral motif visible. This motif stands out due to its distinctive shape resembling a flower. The comparison to a floral shape is deduced from common visual interpretations of such designs.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there star symbols located near the upper shoulders of the central figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the space near the upper shoulders of the central figure is filled with abstract and colorful patterns. While these could symbolize multiple elements, the presence of stars specifically is not clear or predominant in this area. Given the vibrant color scheme, identifying explicit star symbols is not possible based solely on the current patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the central figure have long, wavy hair flowing over the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the central figure with visually vibrant and striking colors, making facial and hair features more distinct. The figure clearly has long, wavy hair flowing over the shoulders, which is consistent with the characteristics of stylized illustrations. This observation is based on the portrayal of hair in the design and the specific way it complements the figure's posture.",
