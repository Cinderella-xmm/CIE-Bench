      "question": "Does the edited image retain the hippo's large size and wrinkled skin texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hippo is depicted as a cartoonish, chibi-style character, which often features exaggerated proportions like a larger head relative to the body. The skin texture in Image B is smooth and lacks the realism of wrinkles found in a real hippo's skin. By contrast, Image A shows a real hippo with a natural, large size and clearly visible skin wrinkles. The transition to an animated format typically simplifies and stylizes features, which is evident here.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the rabbit's small size and upright ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the rabbit in a cartoonish style, maintaining upright ears, which is a key characteristic. Despite the artistic style, the small size relative to the hippo is preserved. Comparing with Image A, where the rabbit is indeed small and has upright ears, Image B maintains these features within the limits of a cartoon representation.",

      "question": "Does the edited image keep the hippo and rabbit positioned close together and oriented towards the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the hippo and rabbit are cartoonish and face towards the viewer, maintaining proximity as indicated by their presence on the same card. In Image A, the hippo and rabbit are also positioned close to each other, facing forward. Both images depict the subjects in close proximity and with a frontal orientation, although the style differs.",

      "question": "Do both the hippo and rabbit retain their calm demeanor in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both characters are stylized with large eyes and a generally static expression, which gives a simplified impression of calm, typical in cartoon portrayals. In Image A, the hippo appears relaxed, lying on the ground with a calm expression, while the rabbit sits attentively. While Image B lacks the detail to show subtle expressions, the overall calm demeanor is carried over through simplification.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain earthy tones that reflect the natural environment of the hippo and rabbit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a more stylized color palette with the green background but still includes earthy tones in the characters themselves, which is characteristic of animal representations. Image A features more realistic earthy tones, reflective of a natural habitat. Despite the artistic liberties of Image B, aspects of the natural color palette remain intact to convey the natural setting.",
