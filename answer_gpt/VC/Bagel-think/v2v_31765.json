      "question": "Is the pile of diced vegetables on the left side of the image orange in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vegetables on the left side are depicted as bright yellow with a hint of orange, resembling diced carrots. The juxtaposition of colors and shapes indicates that these are intended to represent diced vegetables similar to Image A. Image A shows orange diced carrots on the left, thus confirming the representation in Image B, although the tones slightly differ due to the altered artistic style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the green vegetable pieces in the center of the image have a curved, C-shaped form with a visible hollow center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays green vegetables in the center with a curved, C-shaped form and a visible hollow center, resembling celery. This depiction aligns with the characteristics of chopped celery, where the natural curve and hollow center are common. By analyzing Image A, it is clear that Image B maintains these characteristics despite artistic changes.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the diced vegetables on the right side of the image pale white or translucent in appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the diced vegetables on the right are represented with pale, slightly yellow hues, differing from the translucent white appearance in Image A. This alteration appears to be part of the stylistic modification in Image B but does not fully capture the original color, which is indicative of diced onions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a knife with a metallic blade and black handle located in the upper right portion of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a depiction of a knife in the upper right portion, featuring a blade presented in blue hues and maintaining the general shape and positioning similar to Image A. The black handle can be clearly discerned, though the metallic appearance of the blade is altered due to the color scheme chosen in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the surface beneath the vegetables and knife a wooden cutting board with visible horizontal grain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show a clear wooden texture or grain beneath the vegetables and knife. The background exhibits a blend of colors and abstract patterns, deviating from the wooden cutting board appearance seen in Image A. Thus, Image B does not feature a wooden cutting board as Image A does.",

      "question": "Are the three piles of vegetables arranged in a triangular pattern with carrots on the left, celery in the middle, and onions on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of vegetable piles is similar to Image A, maintaining a linear sequence rather than a triangular pattern. The carrots are on the left, celery in the middle, and onions on the right, which is consistent with Image A but not arranged triangularly in either image.",
      "weight": 2,

    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the knife in the upper right area, placed diagonally adjacent to vegetable pieces that are seemingly intended to represent onions. The positioning is nearly identical to that in Image A, where the knife's similar placement in relation to the vegetables & embodies a consistent juxtaposition.",
