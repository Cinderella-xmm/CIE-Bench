      "question": "Is the \"DUCATI\" text in white lettering clearly visible along the down tube of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text \"DUCATI\" is prominently displayed on the down tube of the bicycle frame in large white letters, contrasting against the red background. This visual cue suggests branding typical of bicycle or motorbike companies. Based on the visual evidence from Image B itself, the letters are clear and unmistakably white. Therefore, the answer is informed purely by the visual observation of this text in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does have a 'DUCATI' text on the seat stay of the bicycle frame, seen just above the rear wheel area. This is visible upon inspection, showing the branding consistent with that of the down tube. This observation makes use of the visual details in Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B reveals that there is no visible text near the head tube on the top tube. The wording and positioning can be checked by inspecting the white text along the frames consistent with sports and vehicle branding. Based on this inspection, there is no \"SPORT\" text visible in Image B.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Directly below the bottom bracket in Image B, we can see the word \"TECH\" in white letters. This is a detail that suggests engineering or technical specifications, a common practice in branding of products that sell innovation or performance. The word is consistent with the rest of the branding text styles in this image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a bicycle frame that is predominantly red. The choice of color is vivid and easily identifiable, accompanied by contrasting white and black elements like the brand text and tires. This color analysis derives from visually examining the hue and saturation prominently present in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the saddle and handlebars appear to be black, which is typical for many bicycles where the color scheme contrasts with the frame to highlight the saddle and handlebar shapes. This analysis is based strictly on color observation in Image B and making typical practical design interpretations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the chain can be seen spanning from the front crankset to the rear cassette across the toothed gears, which is critical for bike function as it transmits pedal power to the wheels. The consistency of this functional design is noticeable in Image B. Therefore, the visibility of the chain connecting the two areas is confirmed.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays both tires with a silver reflective stripe along their sidewalls, which is often used for increased visibility and safety. Visually, this stripe is uniform on both front and rear tires, enhancing the look and safety features of the design observed in Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection of Image B, both wheel hubs at the centers of the wheels are not very clearly visible due to the illustration overlay that partially obstructs them. Their visibility is required to be distinct; hence, they are not clearly shown in this context.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bicycle frame in Image B consists of connected top, down, seat, and chain stays forming a diamond-shaped structure typical of most road bicycles. The geometry and design integrity is visible in the way the frame lines are arranged in Image B, maintaining structural predictability for performance and aesthetic. Therefore, the frame maintains its diamond-shaped presence.",
