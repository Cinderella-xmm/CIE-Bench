      "question": "Is the ornate embossed pattern on the typewriter’s base clearly visible and preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the typewriter is prominently featured in the center. The design and details are emphasized in an artistic style consistent with the image’s color palette. The ornate embossed pattern that typically characterizes vintage typewriters is clearly highlighted and preserved within this stylized composition.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the cylindrical metal keys arranged in a QWERTY layout with visible spacing and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the typewriter with an artistic rendering of the keyboard. The keys are styled in the same cylindrical design, but the artistic nature does not explicitly confirm a QWERTY layout with visible key spacing and depth. The focus is more on maintaining the vintage appeal rather than functional detailing.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized depiction of the typewriter does not include certain functional details like a blank sheet of paper in the roller mechanism. The focus is on the typewriter's aesthetic rather than its operational components.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image A shows a ceramic mug with a design, Image B focuses on the vintage typewriter itself within a bordered artistic design, omitting extraneous elements like the mug.",

      "is_correct": false

      "question": "Is the table lamp with a beige fabric shade and classical columnar base positioned to the left of the typewriter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B opts for a close-up and artistic representation of the typewriter itself, eliminating the context and environment of the image, including the table lamp shown in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the desk is minimally depicted as part of the background, focusing instead on the typewriter. The artistic style simplifies or omits details like natural wood grain and reflection to highlight the vintage aspect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question": "Is the framed landscape painting with a winding road and green hills visible on the upper right wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B centers on the stylized rendering of the typewriter with ornate borders, forgoing the detailed background from Image A like wall paintings or other environmental elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses on the artistic depiction of the typewriter with thematic borders, omitting elements like the clock seen in Image A as it emphasizes the typewriter's visual style and not the surrounding environment.",
