      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a key with a bow featuring intricate scrollwork and several spherical finials symmetrically positioned, similar to ornate designs. This observation aligns with common design elements used for decorative keys, which often include such intricate patterns for aesthetic purposes.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains spherical finials placed symmetrically around the scrollwork within the bow. Such symmetry is a crucial aspect of decorative design, contributing to balance and aesthetic appeal.
