      "question": "Does the edited image retain the model’s original facial features, including dark eyes, defined cheekbones, and full lips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features are intentionally blurred or obscured, making it impossible to discern detailed facial characteristics such as eye color, cheekbone definition, or lip fullness. Analyzing Image A, these features are clear, but in Image B, they are deliberately hidden or simplified to a more abstract representation. Therefore, the detailed facial features visible in Image A are not retained in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the model’s long, straight black hair parted down the middle still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the representation of hair is not explicitly detailed, as the style of the artwork simplifies and abstracts these features. On the other hand, Image A presents distinctly styled hair, long, straight, with a middle parting. The edited image does not show this specific styling detail, suggesting an abstraction in favor of a more stylized artistic representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the wide silver crystal choker necklace still visible around the model’s neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neck ornament resembles the choker from Image A, with a similar positioning and the concept of an accessory around the neck, indicated by a band-like appearance. Despite stylistic changes to match the artistic style, Image B retains the idea of a prominent decorative necklace around the neck, albeit stylized.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the model maintain the same upright stance with hands clasped at the waist and legs slightly apart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the model is depicted maintaining an upright stance, with the legs slightly apart and hands in a similar position at the waist. The edited image retains this posture, showing continuity in these bodily positions despite differences in artistic stylistic portrayal. Thus, the fundamental stance is consistent across both images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are both hands positioned together at the waist, holding the bag handle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the model’s hands appear to be together at the waist, giving the impression of holding something centrally, akin to Image A's depiction where both hands are similarly positioned to clasp the bag handle. The edited version has captured this positioning in its stylized form, even through abstraction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the model’s natural skin tone and body proportions preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized rendering abstracts natural skin tone, likely opting for an artistic interpretation using uniform color or gradient suited to the overall design. However, the body proportions remain relatively unchanged from Image A, showing continuity in the figure’s general dimensions despite stylistic changes. This stylization focuses on artistic impact more than precise replication of skin tone.",
