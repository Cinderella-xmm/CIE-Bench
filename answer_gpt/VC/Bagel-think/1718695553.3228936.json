      "question": "Is the orange and black tiger stripe pattern present on the hippo’s body, head, and limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hippo is depicted with a pattern that resembles tiger stripes, which consists of alternating orange and black colors. This pattern is visible across its entire body, including the head, torso, and limbs, indicating a consistent design choice. The visual information provided confirms the presence of such a pattern, logically aligning with the concept of a tiger-striped appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the visible knitted texture with distinct stitches present on the hippo’s body and the beach ball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows both the hippo and the beach ball with a detailed visible knitted texture. This texture includes defined stitches, which are a characteristic feature of knitted items. This observation is based on the visual cues combined with common knowledge about knitted fabric textures, where stitches typically stand out.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the face, belly, and limbs of the hippo rendered in light gray color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face, belly, and limbs of the hippo are depicted in a uniform light gray color. This choice of color is consistent across these areas, contributing to a cohesive appearance alongside the tiger-stripe pattern. Reasoning through visual analysis, the light gray areas provide a contrasting backdrop to the stripes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the beach ball have red, yellow, and white horizontal stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beach ball is shown with a combination of stripes in red, yellow, and white colors. However, these stripes are not horizontal; rather, they radiate from the center of the ball. Thus, while the colors are correctly identified, the description of their orientation, as horizontal, is inaccurate.",

      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the hippo in a posture that is leaning forward, with its front limbs positioned near the beach ball. This posture suggests interaction or engagement with the ball, a choice that is supported by the angle of its body and limbs relative to the ball.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beach ball maintains a round shape, which is a typical feature of balls used for play. The size of the ball is approximately similar to the height of the hippo’s torso, indicating a proportional design that considers balance and playability.",

      "explanation": "Image B shows the hippo with specific facial features: notably large dark eyes, a small curved smile, and small rounded ears. These details contribute to a friendly and approachable character design, aligning with commonly seen plush toy aesthetics. The description matches the visual reality presented.",
