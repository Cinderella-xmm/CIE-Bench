      "question": "Is the intricate geometric and floral pattern (including star and flower shapes) present on the exterior of the lantern/packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging shows an intricate design with geometric and floral motifs on its front, consistent with the original lantern's design shown in Image A. The lantern's surface in Image A has detailed star and floral motifs, which are echoed on the packaging in Image B as well. This indicates that the packaging has retained a similar style of design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colored glass sections (blue, green, orange, red, yellow) arranged in star and floral patterns visible on the lantern’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A features colored glass sections arranged in star and floral patterns on the lantern’s surface. However, in Image B, the design primarily revolves around embossed patterns without any transparent or colored glass elements typical of lanterns. The surface of the packaging in Image B does not display such colored glass sections.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the packaging retain the lantern’s characteristic silhouette with a domed top, rounded body, and flared base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a rectangular box, which diverges significantly from the characteristic silhouette of the lantern in Image A, which features a domed top, rounded body, and flared base. The packaging in Image B does not mimic the lantern's shape and instead adopts a typical packaging box form.",
      "weight": 3,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are circular patterns resembling spice bowls with colored contents (green, red, yellow, brown) visible on the sides of the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the spice bowls are circular with various colored contents, serving as an important visual element. However, Image B focuses on an embossed pattern without any depiction of such circular spice bowls or similar elements. The sides of the packaging do not feature these specific patterns or colored depictions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are geometric patterns derived from Moorish architecture (e.g., interlacing lines, pointed arches) visible in the texture design of the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a decorative texture design that could be inspired by Moorish architecture, with intricate interlacing lines and motifs similar to those found in Islamic art. This resemblance is made evident when considering how architectural influences typically manifest in such patterns, suggesting that the texture on the packaging may stem from Moorish architectural aesthetics.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a visual indication of warm light emanating from within or through the packaging, mimicking the lantern’s glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging in Image B does not have any elements that indicate the presence of inner lighting or a glow emanating from it, contrasting with the warm light glow visible through the lantern's colorful glass in Image A. The packaging has a warm color scheme, but it lacks any source or effect that generates warm light similar to the lantern's function.",
