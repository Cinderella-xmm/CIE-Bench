      "question": "Is the crown-like forehead design with three dots and a central triangle present on the child's forehead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible design or adornment on the child's forehead; the image primarily showcases the child in a historical costume setting without such details. Observing the surrounding elements and attire suggests a period representation rather than contemporary design elements like a crown-like forehead design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show the lace-like borders around the eyes.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues indicate that the eyes are positioned symmetrically as determined by the natural alignment of the facial features, reinforced by the posed composition typical of traditional portraiture.",
