      "question": "Is the mechanical eyepatch with visible screws and metallic surface present on the central characterâ€™s right eye?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central character is indeed wearing an eyepatch on their right eye. However, the images show that the eyepatch does not have detailed mechanical elements like visible screws or a distinctly metallic surface. My analysis is based solely on the available visual features of the eyepatch in Image B without referring to Image A.",

      "question": "Is the central character holding an open book in both hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central character is depicted holding an open book. The posture suggests that they are holding it in a reading position. Commonly, this implies using both hands for support and stability. Therefore, the visual cue indicates the book is held in both hands.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the book cover held by the central character has no discernible elements resembling Chinese-style calligraphy. Calligraphy typically involves artistic, flowing script with particular stylistic features, which are not visually evident on the book cover.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central character is shown with short hair that appears straight. The visual shading and design suggest it is likely black or a similarly dark color, consistent with the typical manga and anime style of short, straight dark hair.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are supporting characters in its background, but not all specified hair colors are present. Only one character with purple hair is distinctly noticeable. Others do not fit the description exactly, as the details suggest different features not specified in the question.",
