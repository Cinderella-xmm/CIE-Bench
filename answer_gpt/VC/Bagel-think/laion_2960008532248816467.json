    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the stylized \"P\" logo with a cart-like shape and circular wheel present on the surface of both tarts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both tarts feature faces with cartoon-like eyes and smiles, indicating the presence of artistic modifications. Common logos or designs would not usually accompany such whimsical elements, allowing the conclusion that a formal logo is absent on these tarts due to the lack of similar visual cues. Comparing with Image A, the stylized 'P' with a cart-like shape is clearly visible, which is absent in Image B's edited cartoon style.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the word \"PABLO\" written in uppercase letters beneath the logo on both tarts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the tarts do not exhibit any text or branding directly on their surfaces, primarily due to the cartoon features replacing typical representational content. Image A clearly displays the 'PABLO' text beneath each logo, making its absence in Image B evident in comparison.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the top surface of each tart display a bright yellow layer covering most of the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows tarts with seemingly similar yellow surfaces as part of their cartoon faces, signifying some form of yellow topping, consistent across interpretations of dessert appearances. Comparing to Image A, the bright yellow layer is distinctly apparent, consistent with both interpretations of tarts in their respective representations.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible white creamy filling beneath the yellow top layer in both tarts, especially in the sliced portion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the sliced tart with a clear white section beneath the yellow surface, indicating a creamy filling through visual cues common in desserts. Image A similarly shows white creamy filling, confirming the consistent presence of this feature between the two images.",
      "weight": 2,

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the crust of both tarts exhibit a golden-brown color with a flaky, uneven edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crust appears with similar culinary brown tones and uneven texture, aligning with common pastry characteristics. The comparison to Image A confirms this presence, where visual cues clearly indicate a golden-brown, flaky crust, forming similar conclusions in both images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the rear tart partially sliced to reveal the internal cross-section of the filling and crust?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents one tart visibly sliced, showcasing the filling and crust layers, matching typical representations of a sliced pastry. Similarly, Image A displays the rear tart sliced to reveal similar sections, indicating the same level of visibility.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the whole tart positioned in front of the partially sliced tart, with the latter slightly elevated and angled toward the back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image Bâ€™s composition depicts the whole tart in front of the sliced tart, aligning with typical presentation logic where the front item is whole, and the sliced one serves detail. Image A maintains this positional arrangement, with the sliced tart slightly elevated and angled, corroborating this understanding.",
