    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the vertical cluster of lavender-like flowers with fuzzy purple petals present in the same structural arrangement as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible lavender-like flowers with fuzzy petals as seen in Image A. Image A prominently features the vertical cluster of such flowers, indicating that Image B has a different floral arrangement and setting. Hence, the structural arrangement is not the same.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a single blue flower with a yellow center located at the top of the flower cluster?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible blue flower with a yellow center similar to the one seen in Image A. Image A clearly shows this flower as part of the cluster, which is not present in Image B, indicating a different visual composition.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the butterfly positioned with its legs touching the flower stem, maintaining physical contact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a recognizable butterfly maintaining contact with a flower stem. Instead, it depicts a fantastical, artistic creature that differs from a realistic butterfly structure and does not appear to be touching any plant structure. In contrast, Image A shows the butterfly's legs in contact with the stem.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the wings of the butterfly fully spread in a side profile view, showing both left and right wings symmetrically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depicted creature has wings that are not presented in a full spread, side-profile view as in traditional depictions of butterflies. It features a creative, dynamic position, unlike the symmetrical, side-profile view seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighting in the image coming from above, casting a warm golden glow over the butterfly and flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting creates a magical, ethereal environment that appears as warm, with a glow suggestive of light coming from multiple angles, including possibly from above, as seen in the warm tone across the scene. This is somewhat consistent with Image A, which has a similar golden light effect.",
