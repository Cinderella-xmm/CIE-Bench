      "question": "Is the key-shaped symbol with swirling arms and central knob present on the leftmost book of the bottom shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure is composed of block-like elements and not books. The focus is on a block tower rather than a bookshelf filled with books. Given that the key-shaped symbol you describe refers to details typically found on carved books, it is not applicable to the block structure. Therefore, it is evident that such a symbol is not present in Image B as it would be on a book in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the spiral motif clearly visible on the central book of the bottom shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a block-like structure with different colored bricks. This doesn't correlate with the presence of books or any spiral motifs typical of book designs. Hence, the spiral motif on the central book, as would be recognizable in a bookshelf, is absent from this block structure.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the flowing vine-like pattern present on the rightmost book of the bottom shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, it is a block structure, devoid of books and thus, lacking any ornamental vine-like patterns that one might expect on carved book designs or bookshelf decorations. Consequently, such a pattern is not present in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the interlacing Celtic knotwork patterns present on the top panel and vertical side frames of the bookshelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a block tower structure that lacks any framing or paneling conducive to displaying intricate designs such as Celtic knotwork. This contrasts with potential decorative elements on a bookshelf in Image A. Therefore, these patterns are not present in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the three large books with detailed carvings positioned side by side on the bottom shelf, from left to right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a block-like tower instead of a bookshelf filled with books. As such, the concept of large books positioned on a shelf doesn't translate to this block structure. Thus, no such arrangement of books is present in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there at least four books with visible carved spines distributed across the middle and upper shelves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a block tower, and not recognizable books with carved spines. This lacks the elements that would display spines, particularly carved ones, across any shelf, contrasting to what might be seen in a bookshelf in Image A. Therefore, there are no book spines visible in the block structure of Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the books and structural elements rendered in earthy tones such as brown, tan, and muted red?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a block structure with a color palette consisting predominantly of brown and black blocks. Although earthy tones are present, the reference to books is not applicable since the structure does not resemble a bookshelf setup but rather, a stack of blocks.",
