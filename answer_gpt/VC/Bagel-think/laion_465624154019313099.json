    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the grid of yellow rounded domes covering the surface of the cake present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake is illustrated with a cover of yellow rounded domes, similar to Image A where these domes are clearly seen. These are maintaining a grid-like appearance, typical of decorative cake designs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there small red dots on top of each yellow dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration of the cake suggests the presence of domes, but it adds features like cartoon eyes and expressions rather than focusing on small red dots. In Image A, small red dots can be seen on some domes. The edit emphasizes a different style, omitting this detail for effect.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cross-section showing a golden sponge base, white cream layer, and deep red jam layer visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's cartoon-style depiction does not emphasize a cross-section or interior layers like a real cake would. The focus is on the exterior and anthropomorphized features, whereas Image A clearly shows the cross-section with different layers.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are two strawberries with green leaves positioned at the top center of the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the anthropomorphized cake with a few strawberries placed on top, similar to how strawberries are positioned at the center in Image A. This element is carried over without significant change.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are chopped nuts visible around the base of the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration does not depict details such as chopped nuts around the cake’s base. Image A, however, clearly shows these chopped nuts. The edit focuses more on the comedic effect rather than accurate detailing of such elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the cake maintain a square shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image in Image B showcases a cake that largely retains the square shape, consistent with how a cake is typically illustrated despite the cartoonish changes. Image A also portrays the cake in a square shape.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the cake placed on a silver-toned plate with an embossed floral pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not detail the cake being on a silver-toned plate with an embossed floral pattern—it shows the cake on a plate but lacks fine detail due to its illustrated nature. Image A presents the cake placed on such a plate.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the deep red jam layer clearly visible between the white cream and golden sponge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, by its cartoon nature, does not focus or detail internal layers such as a jam layer. This aspect is more meticulously shown in Image A where the cross-section visibly displays these layers.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Is the white cream layer visible between the sponge and jam layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, internal layers do not receive emphasis and hence, the white cream layer between other layers is not visibly detailed like in Image A, where it is clearly seen in the cross-section.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q10",
      "question": "Is the golden sponge base layer visible in the cross-section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, a cross-section illustrating the layers of the cake is not a focal point. While Image A details it clearly, Image B's format overlooks such specifics for caricature impact.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
