    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the bust oriented in a side profile facing to the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bust is viewed from a frontal perspective, with the torso facing forward. This positioning shows the shoulders and chest squarely, characteristic of front-facing sculptures, rather than a side profile that would show more of one shoulder than the other and face to the right.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there an inscribed plaque on the base with the word \"APOLLO\" visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is clearly an inscribed plaque at the base of the bust. The word 'APOLLO' is visible and legible, indicating the name of the figure represented by the sculpture. This is consistent with classical busts where inscriptions often depict the subject's name.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the neck, shoulders, and chest consistent with the original sculptural form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the neck, shoulders, and chest retain a symmetrical and anatomically proportional appearance typical of classical sculptures. The modifications to the surface with steampunk elements do not alter the fundamental proportions of the bust.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drapery is designed to extend from the left shoulder across the chest in a diagonal fold, similar to the artistic design seen in classical sculptures where garments are often depicted in this manner.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the bust appears as a cylindrical pedestal. It has a flat top where the bust sits, and the lower portion of the pedestal shows a rounded form, fitting the description of a cylindrical pedestal with a flat top and rounded bottom.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible small circular medallion or button-like ornament on the left shoulder. Instead, the shoulder area is embellished with gears and other steampunk elements, diverging from the classical appearance of such ornaments.",
