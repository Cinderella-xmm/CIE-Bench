      "question": "Is the woman’s hair styled in a short, straight black bob that frames her face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's hair is depicted as a short, straight bob which is colored black and frames her face. This hairstyle is commonly recognized as a bob, known for its distinct straight edges and uniform length around the head. Visual observation of this neat, straight-edged hairstyle confirms its classification as such.",

      "question": "Does the woman wear a red sleeveless dress with visible knitted texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the woman in a red dress, which appears to have embroidered floral patterns rather than a knitted texture. The use of artistic illustration transforms the dress from knitted to have elaborate flower details commonly recognized in decorative designs. This indicates that while it is a sleeveless red dress, the texture is not knitted in the edited version.",

      "question": "Are the butterfly wings behind her back colored with blue centers, brown borders, and orange tips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly wings are illustrated with vivid colors, having blue centers, brown borders, and prominently orange tips. These color patterns are consistent with those seen on actual butterfly wings, which often exhibit a range of colors for camouflage and attraction functions. The illustration maintains these color schemes faithfully.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's hands are depicted as clasped together in front of her chest, but the fingers are not interlocked. Her fingers are shown as layered against each other, a position often associated with a gesture of calm or prayer rather than being interlocked.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a strap, colored in a tone that appears to be light brown, crossing diagonally from her right shoulder to her left hip. This visual cue is consistent with the typical representation of a crossbody bag strap that provides a sense of balance and convenience for carrying.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's fingernails are illustrated with a bright red color, indicative of nail polish. This bright hue is very commonly used in nail fashion for its vibrant appeal and the ability to stand out against the skin tone, providing a visual confirmation of the nail color choice.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not provide details of the woman's expression or makeup in the visible areas due to the blurred section covering the face. Without visible details, it is impossible to determine or confirm the presence of a smile, lipstick, or eyes, so this cannot be accurately observed or concluded.",
