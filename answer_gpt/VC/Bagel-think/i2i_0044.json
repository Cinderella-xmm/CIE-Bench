      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandwich is represented in a cartoon style, which simplifies and abstracts the visual details of the image. The cartoon depiction shows the sandwich but does not provide a detailed view of layered ingredients as in a photographic representation. The cartoon style emphasizes outlines and bold colors, rather than fine details such as individual layers of ingredients, which are clearly visible in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the sandwich bread retain its golden-brown crust appearance despite the cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a simplified cartoon style emphasizing bold colors and outlines. The bread is depicted with an orange-yellow hue, a common representation of a golden-brown color in cartoon images, suggesting that the sandwich bread retains a semblance of its golden-brown crust appearance. Image A shows a more realistic golden-brown crust on the bread.",

      "question": "Does the sandwich remain on the white, rectangular plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandwich is depicted on a surface with an outline resembling a white, rectangular plate, similar to Image A. Despite the cartoon style, the positioning and surrounding line suggest the presence of a plate. Image A clearly shows the sandwich on a white rectangular plate.",

      "question": "Does the background still depict a wooden table surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B abstracts many details, and there is no specific depiction of a wooden table surface. The background lacks texture or distinct features to confirm that it is a wooden surface, unlike Image A, which clearly shows the sandwich on a wooden table. Without visual cues indicating a wooden texture or color, the background cannot be confirmed as a wooden table.",

      "question": "Is the sandwich positioned centrally on the plate as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, with its cartoon depiction, shows the sandwich with attention to positioning relative to outlined elements that suggest a plate. However, due to the simplified style, it is difficult to determine the precise positioning which appears more abstract. In Image A, the sandwich is positioned off-center towards the front of the plate. Image B makes it hard to establish exact positioning due to stylized abstraction.",
