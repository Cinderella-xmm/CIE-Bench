      "question": "Does the girl retain her original throwing posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl's posture shows an arm extended outward, holding some type of shield that suggests a readiness to move or throw something. This compares to common poses linked to action or throwing. Despite some stylization, it appears the girl retains her original throwing posture. Given this visual cue, it suggests that the posture aligns with what one would associate with a throwing action.",

      "question": "Are the red dress and polka-dot pattern retained intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl is depicted wearing a red dress with white polka-dots, which mirrors a common children's clothing pattern. Comparing this to the red garment with white polka-dots in Image A, it is clear that this design has been preserved in terms of pattern and color.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the girl still positioned in the foreground relative to the ground or new sci-fi background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl appears prominent in the composition, standing atop a pedestal-like object, and the background is stylized in a sci-fi, castle-like environment. This positioning establishes her in the foreground. Comparing to Image A, where the girl is similarly positioned in the front with residential elements in the background, the relation of her foreground placement remains consistent.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the girl's feet still placed on the stone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl stands on a stone-like object within the sci-fi styled background, emphasizing her position and alignment with the original Image A, where she stands on a similar object in a more natural scene. Therefore, her feet continue to be placed on what can be assumed as stone.",

      "question": "Are the girl's hands still extended outward as if throwing something?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl's hands are positioned outward, holding an object, which could imply an action intent much like throwing. Comparing to Image A, this posture seems to be a stylized retention of her initial throwing stance, suggesting a consistency in the outward arm extension.",
