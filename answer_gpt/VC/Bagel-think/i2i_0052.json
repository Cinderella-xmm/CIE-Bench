        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two cartoon characters styled as sheep have a smooth and stylized appearance. The wool texture is represented in a simplified cartoon manner and lacks the natural irregular texture of real sheep wool. World knowledge tells us that cartoon depictions often simplify and stylize features for aesthetic and clarity, which is evident here in the smooth lines. Therefore, the natural wool texture is not retained in this edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features cartoon characters that resemble sheep, and they have facial and leg markings, but these are stylized and simplified compared to real sheep. While sheep in cartoons may have simplified markings for clear visibility, these are significantly different from natural sheep markings. In a comparison, Image A displays real sheep with distinctive natural facial and leg markings. Thus, the markings as we see in Image A are not retained exactly in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background continues to portray a grassy field setting similar to that in Image A, but the distribution of sheep is changed because only cartoon sheep characters are present in the foreground. Knowledge of editing images suggests that elements of the setting can be retained while the subjects may be altered. Here, the depiction of the grassy field is retained, but the distribution of real sheep is not maintained in the same way as Image A where multiple sheep are visible scattered across the field.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B show a tree line in the background, which suggests the border of the field is retained in the edited image. Common sense indicates that the editing primarily focused on changing the sheep rather than the background setting. Therefore, the tree line marking the field's border is retained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon sheep characters are depicted holding tennis rackets and shaking hands, which are not behaviors typical of real sheep, as depicted in Image A. Real sheep display behaviors such as grazing or standing idly. In typical cartoon edits, characters are often stylized in engaging or humorous activities rather than natural behaviors, which is evident here.",
