      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera prominently displays the 'Canon' logo in white text on the top of the camera body. This is visually clear and consistent with how branding is commonly placed for visibility. The logo's presence is evident and not obscured by any other elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, there is no visible 'SX 60 HS' text in silver lettering. The camera body is stylized with additional features like the hat and strap, and the surface where the text would be is not shown clearly.",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a distinct feature resembling a mode dial is visible on the top left of the camera, in alignment with typical camera designs where such features are located. This suggests the incorporation of camera functional elements despite the illustrative style.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display a small circular flash unit above the lens. The camera has an artistic overlay, including a hat, which does not show this typical camera feature, making its presence unlikely or hidden.",
