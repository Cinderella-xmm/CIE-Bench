    {

      "question": "Are the thick, textured brushstrokes of the original painting retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunflowers have been placed digitally into a modern kitchen setting. The brushstroke texture of the original painting is not clearly discernible, as the image appears to lack the original painting's painterly detail and texture. This suggests the smooth digital integration over textured artwork.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does display a similar bright golden yellow for the sunflowers as is commonly associated with Van Gogh's sunflowers. The vivid yellow hues are retained in the digital rendition within the kitchen setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vase in Image B maintains the off-white and light yellow coloration. The handwritten signature 'Vincent' is visible and appears to be retained from the original painting, suggesting attention to these details during digital editing.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement of the sunflowers in Image B largely mirrors their original positioning and angles as seen in Image A. This suggests the editor aimed to maintain the natural and unique arrangement of flowers from Van Gogh's original composition.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves and stems maintain the green color and appear consistent with their original shape and placement from Image A. The texture may be smoother due to the digital integration, but visually the common features are preserved.",
