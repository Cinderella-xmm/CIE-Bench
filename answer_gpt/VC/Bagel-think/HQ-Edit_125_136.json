      "question": "Is the American flag patch present on the right shoulder of the astronaut?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut is depicted as a stylized illustration. The flag details on the astronaut's suit may not be as realistically depicted as in Image A. In most realistic depictions, the flag is often seen on the right shoulder, however, in this cartoonish illustration, there is no visible flag on the astronaut's right shoulder, suggesting that it was omitted or stylized away for the design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the blue NASA insignia patch visible on the left shoulder of the astronaut?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In this illustrated version (Image B), specific details like insignia patches may be simplified or altered for artistic style. The left shoulder has yellow patches rather than a detailed insignia, indicating that the NASA insignia is not present in this depiction.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is Earth visible in the reflection within the astronaut’s helmet visor, appearing above the lunar horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut's helmet visor does show the Earth above the horizon line, similar to how it might appear from the lunar surface. The Earth is a significant detail that has been maintained from the original design, thus making it visible in this stylized rendition.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the International Space Station visible in the background with its solar panels and modular structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration features elements that resemble the International Space Station with its distinct solar panels. These elements are similarly placed in the background on the right side of the image, as in Image A, indicating the presence of the ISS.",

      "question": "Is the ground beneath the astronaut visibly cratered and gray, consistent with the Moon’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction in Image B is a stylized version, and while it maintains some visual elements of being on a lunar surface, it does not prominently feature gray craters. This artistic simplification suggests a lack of realistic surface texture in this rendering.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the astronaut facing forward with both side lights on the helmet illuminated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut is illustrated facing forward, just as in Image A. The helmet has side lights depicted, but their illumination status in this stylized version is ambiguous. The illustration's simplicity might imply they are not illuminated as clearly as in the original realistic depiction.",
