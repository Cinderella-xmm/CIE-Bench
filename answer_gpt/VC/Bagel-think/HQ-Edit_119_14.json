      "question": "Is the full white beard present on the figureâ€™s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the facial features are not visible due to blurring, the clothing and accessories such as the top hat and decorative feathers are visible, indicating a formal, presumably aristocratic style outfit. This suggests that a full white beard is likely not present, as such visual cues are often associated with clean-shaven or well-groomed men in historical portraits.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a red or dark tilak mark positioned between the eyebrows on the forehead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the attire and background in Image B, it appears to depict a European gentleman in a historical setting, characterized by the formal attire such as a top hat and suit. These elements are typically associated with Western culture, which does not traditionally include a tilak mark. Therefore, it is unlikely that there is a red or dark tilak mark on the forehead.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the figure displaying an open-mouthed smile showing teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Even though the face is not visible, the context and setting of Image B with its formal attire and solemn, dignified setting suggest that an open-mouthed smile showing teeth is not portrayed. Historical portraits typically depict figures with closed-mouth expressions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the figure standing upright with arms relaxed at the sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B appears to be standing in a formal, upright posture common in portraiture of gentlemen. Although the position of the arms is not fully visible due to cropping at the waist, the clothing style and setting imply a traditional relaxed posture often associated with formal portraits.",
      "weight": 2,

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the figure shown in full-body view and centered in the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cropped view of the figure, focusing on the upper body and attire, rather than a full-body view. The figure is not visible below the waist, indicating it is not in full-body view. The composition centers on the torso and upper body attire.",
      "weight": 1,

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the natural skin tone and facial texture (including wrinkles) preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given that the face is actually blurred out in Image B, there is no discernible facial detail such as skin tone or texture present. As a result, we can't say that natural skin tone and facial texture are preserved.",
