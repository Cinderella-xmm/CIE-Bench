      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, analyzing the side view of the car, which is primarily captured in the lower image, the GT badge can be observed right behind the front wheel. This is a common placement for the badge on Ford Mustangs, which helps identify the specific model.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, in both views of the car (top and bottom images), the wheels have the same black multi-spoke design. This design is distinct and consistently depicted across both views, indicating that the car likely has a uniform wheel design.",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the headlights are visible in both images and are correctly placed within the car's design, aligned with the standard placement on a Mustang. However, the orientation and views don't clearly show the exhaust outlets, making it difficult to fully confirm their position, though the visible elements are correctly designed and placed.",
