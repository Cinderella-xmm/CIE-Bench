      "question": "Does the dog retain its reddish-brown fur in both the left side and back views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is depicted with reddish-brown fur, which is a consistent color scheme across its body, including both the left side and back of the dog that are visible. This indicates that the reddish-brown fur is part of its consistent appearance. To verify continuity, Image A can be referenced, where the dog also has reddish-brown fur on both visible sides. Given these observations, the dog retains its fur color across different angles in both images.",

      "question": "Are the dog’s floppy ears present and maintained in shape in both views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is shown with floppy ears that hang down on either side of its head, which is a common trait in certain dog breeds. The ears appear to be drawn as simple yet identifiably floppy, suggesting retention of their intended form. Referring to Image A, the dog's floppy ears are similarly depicted, supporting the assumption that the ear shape is maintained in both images.",

      "question": "Is the dog wearing a red collar with a tag in both views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is wearing a collar that appears red with a tag attached, which is a typical accessory for domesticated dogs indicating ownership or identification. This accessory can be verified in Image A, where the dog also wears the same red collar with a tag. The consistency of this accessory in both views suggests it remains unchanged across the images.",

      "question": "Is the dog still lying on a wooden bed with a green mattress and pillow in both views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dog lying on a wooden bed that has a green mattress and pillow, which is a simplified depiction of a pet bed arrangement. Corroborating this setup, Image A features a similar wooden bed with the same green mattress and pillow. Given these setups are consistent in both images, the bed retains its appearance and components in both views.",

    {

      "question": "Is the dog’s bed set against a pale blue background with green grass around it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spatial arrangement of the dog’s bed against a pale blue background alongside green grass is observable, which suggests an outdoor setting or stylized environment. Image A also showcases the same backdrop with pale blue and patches of green grass surrounding the bed. The consistency in environment confirms the outdoor scene is a maintained feature in both images.",
