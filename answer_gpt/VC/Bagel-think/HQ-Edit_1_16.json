      "question": "Is the bird's eye clearly visible with a dark blue iris, black pupil, and a thin white orbital ring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's eye is prominently visible. It features a dark blue iris, which is distinguishable from the black pupil due to the contrast between the two colors. Additionally, a thin white orbital ring surrounds the iris, enhancing the distinctiveness of the eye. This combination of visual cues supports the conclusion that the bird's eye has a dark blue iris, black pupil, and a thin white orbital ring. Thus, the answer is 'Yes'.",
