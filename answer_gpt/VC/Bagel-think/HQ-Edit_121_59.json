      "question": "Is the white beard and mustache clearly visible on the man’s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's reflection in the water shows a white beard and mustache, which is a characteristic facial feature often associated with older men. This reflection works as a cue to confirm the presence of these features despite the direct view of the face being blurred. The reasoning is based on the assumption that reflections generally match the features of the original subject.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man sitting in the center appears to be wearing a wide-brimmed olive-green hat, both in his actual pose and in his reflection in the water. The hat's distinctive style helps shade the face, usually used for outdoor activities like fishing, confirming its presence on his head based on visual cues.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is depicted wearing a shirt with a red-and-brown plaid pattern. This type of pattern involves intersecting lines of color that create a checkered appearance, common in outdoor attire. The visual pattern is recognizable both on the actual shirt and in its reflection, confirming its presence.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is seen seated above the water, presumably on a wooden stool. The presence of a stool is typical for providing a seating area in environments like this one. The reflection in the water also suggests a similar structure beneath him, reinforcing its presence.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a rod in the man's hands, but a visible fishing line extending into the water is not clearly depicted, indicating that it may not be included in the image. Fishing typically involves a line, but due to visual limits, its presence cannot be confirmed directly here.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, it is noted that a spinning reel is visible on the right side, detached from the rod but floating nearby. This presence suggests it is an essential fishing tool either about to be attached or recently detached, typically observed in fishing contexts.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the reflection in the water shows a complete image that includes the man's hat, shirt, rod, and stool. The clarity and continuity of the reflection imply these elements are properly mirrored, indicative of the scene's setup and the nature of reflections on calm water surfaces.",
