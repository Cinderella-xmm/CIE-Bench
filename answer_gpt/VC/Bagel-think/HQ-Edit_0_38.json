        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's facial profile, including the beard and mustache, has been obscured by a blur, making it impossible to see any specific details about the shape or presence of the beard and mustache. The analysis process combines an understanding of the positioning and alteration of the image elements, leading to the conclusion that these features are not clearly presented as initially visible.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dark purple grape clusters still hang from the green leaves on the right side of the image near the man’s shoulder. This conclusion is drawn from the continued presence and positioning, evidenced by the visual portrayal of the grape clusters amidst the leaves.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's facial profile, including specific facial features like the nose and jawline, is obscured by the blur, thus preventing any clear visibility or assessment of their shape. This alteration means these attributes are not visible or preserved, as logic suggests obscured elements cannot be distinctly observed compared to an unobscured view.",
