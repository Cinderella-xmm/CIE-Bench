      "question": "Is the butterfly still positioned centrally in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly appears to be centrally positioned within the frame. This conclusion is drawn by observing the butterfly's distance from the edges of the image, which is approximately equal, suggesting a center alignment. Utilizing common sense in composition, a centrally positioned subject often has equal spacing around it in photography to draw attention and maintain balance.",

      "question": "Does the butterfly retain its blue color theme, even if reinterpreted as energy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is depicted with a luminous blue color that resembles energy or light. The blue color is very prominent and is the primary color visible on the butterfly. This analysis is based on the visual similarity to energy or light depicted in artworks, where bright colors like blue are used to give a glowing or energetic effect. The original theme of the butterfly's color being blue is preserved, although its representation has transformed.",

      "question": "Does the dark silhouette below the butterfly retain its general rugged shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dark silhouette below the butterfly maintains a rugged, uneven appearance. This can be seen by analyzing the undulating and jagged edges of the silhouette, which resemble rough terrain or rocky surfaces. Comparing this with a possible expectation of a silhouette shape, the rugged characteristic appears to be retained from the original concept.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the butterfly still depicted as hovering above the dark silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is indeed depicted as hovering above the dark silhouette. This conclusion is based on the spatial arrangement where the butterfly is located above the silhouette with clear spacing between them, which gives the visual impression of hovering. This positioning above the silhouette helps suggest flight or hovering, consistent with depictions of butterflies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the dark silhouette below the butterfly retain its dark color contrast with the butterfly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dark silhouette below maintains a strong color contrast with the bright, luminous blue butterfly. The silhouette is a very dark shade, possibly black, providing a stark contrast against the bright, glowing blue of the butterfly. This contrast emphasizes the butterfly and enhances its visibility, a common technique seen in art to focus attention on the subject.",
