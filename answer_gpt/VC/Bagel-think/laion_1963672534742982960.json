      "question": "Are the eyes of the figure still bright blue with clearly visible irises?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is depicted as a chibi-style keychain enclosed in a snow globe. Chibi figures often have simplified features, and due to the face being blurred, the presence of bright blue eyes with visible irises cannot be confirmed in this style. Therefore, it is likely that the eyes are not as detailed as those in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the facial texture still characterized by deep, horizontal and vertical wrinkles and a cracked, stone-like pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's face belongs to a chibi-style representation with a simplified aesthetic. This style typically avoids complex textures such as deep wrinkles and cracked patterns, favoring smooth and more straightforward designs. Therefore, the detailed facial texture from Image A is not present in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the figure still shown with long, white hair extending past the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figure's hair is visibly silver or white and styled long. However, being chibi-style, it is depicted flowing around the head but does not clearly extend past the shoulders due to the figure's overall stylistic proportions and presentation.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the figure still have a full, white beard covering the lower face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is stylized as a chibi, and characters in this style are typically represented without the realistic features like a full beard due to their cute and simplistic design. The figure does not show any obvious beard in this depiction.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the facial contours, including the jawline and cheekbones, still clearly defined and consistent with the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character lacks the defined jawline and cheekbones that are seen in realistic portrayals like Image A. Chibi style intentionally simplifies these features, resulting in softer, rounder contours, inconsistent with the original's distinct angular features.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the neck still visibly defined and structured, showing a clear transition from head to torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi representation usually minimizes anatomical details such as neck definition. The transition from head to torso is fluid in chibi art, lacking a visibly structured neck that you would expect in a more realistic depiction like in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "No",
