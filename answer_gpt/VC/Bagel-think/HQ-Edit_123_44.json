    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the U.S. national insignia (white star within a blue circle, flanked by red and white bars) present on the wings and fuselage of the aircraft?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the aircraft is inside a display case but clearly visible. The wings are marked with the U.S. national insignia, identifiable by the white star in a roundel which is traditionally representative of U.S. military aircraft. This is an important feature for identifying American planes and suggests it was intended to represent such equipment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there two radial engines mounted beneath the wings of the aircraft, one on each side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the aircraft within the display case does indeed have two engines, one under each wing, as evidenced by their prominent placement and design, typical of radial engine configurations on older military aircraft. These engines are designed to have a circular front for the intake vent, distinctive for radial types.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does each engine have a three-bladed propeller attached to its front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the propellers on the aircraft are clearly shown and each engine has a three-bladed configuration. This detail can be observed through the display case and is consistent with the engineering design of multi-engine propeller aircraft used in military settings historically.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a rounded, transparent cockpit canopy located at the front of the fuselage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cockpit of the aircraft in Image B is visible and features a rounded, dome-like canopy, which is typical for bombers and reconnaissance aircraft, allowing pilots to have panoramic views, crucial for strategic operations. This construction is made of transparent material, common for visibility.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the wings extend straight and symmetrically from the fuselage, forming a dihedral angle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings of the plane are observed to be extending symmetrically from the body of the aircraft and exhibit a straight line without curving upwards or downwards significantly, which indicates that a dihedral angle is not present. This is in line with older aircraft designs that commonly had flat wings.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the tail section composed of a vertical stabilizer and two horizontal stabilizers with small fins at the ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tail of the aircraft demonstrates the presence of both a vertical stabilizer and horizontal stabilizers. However, the image, even within the display case, doesnâ€™t show prominent small fins at the ends of the horizontal stabilizers which would be necessary for lateral control surfaces called endplates or fins. Such structures are used to improve lateral stability.",
