      "question": "Is there a large, fully bloomed white rose positioned in the bottom-right area of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roses appear stylized and feature an intricate grid pattern, suggesting a reinterpretation of fully bloomed flowers. The color is altered to beige and cream owing to the artistic edit, but the size and positioning indicate the presence of a large bloom in the bottom-right area. Despite the color change, the visual representation is consistent with a fully bloomed rose.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a pointed arch window with decorative tracery visible on the upper part of the brick building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stylized brick structure with a window featuring decorative elements. The intricate design around the window aligns with the characteristic tracery one might expect in pointed arch architecture. Despite the edit altering colors and sharpness, the window arch's shape and decorative aspect remain clearly visible.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the building have a visible corner formed by two intersecting brick walls meeting at a right angle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a brick structure where two walls meet at a corner, creating a clear right angle. The building's architectural lines have been preserved in the edited image, despite the stylized alterations.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there at least three distinct rose buds visible along the stems, including one with pink tips near the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image has transformed the roses into stylized floral forms, where buds are less apparent due to the artistic modification. Focus is given to the fully bloomed roses in the foreground, and distinct buds, especially with colored tips, are not distinguishable due to the altered aesthetics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there dark green, serrated leaves present along the stems of the rose bush?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves have been altered in color to turquoise hues, deviating from the natural green seen in Image A. They possess a stylized design removing the serrated edge detail typical of rose leaves. The leaves appear as smooth-edged shapes within the overall stylized imagery.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the roses positioned in front of the brick building, creating a clear foreground-background separation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a stylized foreground of roses distinctly positioned in front of the more geometrical and patterned brick building, establishing a clear separation between the two. The architectural transformation gives both elements distinctive spatial recognition despite the edits.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a tall, vertical brick structure (buttress or tower) extending upward on the left side of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the building's structural elements where tall vertical extensions, akin to buttresses or towers, are visible on the left side. The edited stylization maintains the architectural integrity reflecting these structural attributes effectively.",
