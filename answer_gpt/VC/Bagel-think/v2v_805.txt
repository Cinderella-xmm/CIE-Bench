    "Question": "Q1: Is the text 'STORY PAGES' present in uppercase serif font above the book?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on the snow globe, which contains a small, illustrated book inside, surrounded by snow-like particles, placed on a desk with a lamp and bookshelves in the background.

    "Question": "Q2: Does the book have a visible spine and two cover edges forming an open structure?",
    "explanation": "The book inside the snow globe in Image B is depicted in a simplified, somewhat abstract form without specific detailing like a visible spine or cover edges that clearly form an open structure.

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there multiple curved horizontal lines on both left and right sides of the book representing stacked pages?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the book inside the snow globe appears to have symbolic horizontal lines, which could suggest pages, but they are not clearly curved or distinctly representing stacked pages on both sides. The depiction is simple without detailed realism as seen in typical book illustrations aimed at showing precise page separation.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the book centered horizontally and vertically beneath the text 'STORY PAGES'?",
    "explanation": "The concept presented in Image B is of a book inside a snow globe, placed centrally in the scene; however, there is no occurrence of the text 'STORY PAGES' in the edited image. Therefore, there is no text for the book to be centered beneath within the composition.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the book and text rendered in dark navy blue on a light beige background?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a warm tone setting with a wooden desk and a lit lamp, and the book is designed within a snow globe with the entire image set against a blurred bookshelf background. The book is not rendered in dark navy blue, and there is no accompanying text in the scene. The light source introduces a range of browns and golden hues rather than a beige background with navy blue elements.",
    "answer": "No"
