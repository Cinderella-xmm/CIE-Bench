    "Question": "Q1: Are there exactly six chairs surrounding the table?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are visual representations of seating objects surrounding the central table. However, the objects appear to be constructed of blocks rather than actual chairs, and their distinctive forms and alignments imply they are not typical chairs. Analysis of these block structures suggests fewer than six distinct seating structures. This interpretation is consistent with the visual layout in the edited image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the table square in shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the table appears to be constructed using brown and beige bricks arranged in equal lengths from each side, forming a square shape. The symmetry and equal measurements visually suggest the table is square.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there two chairs on each long side of the table and one chair on each short side?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, although there are several block arrangements surrounding the table, each side does not present two chairs on the long sides and one chair on the short sides. This arrangement is unclear from the edited image based on how the block structures are displayed.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the chairs on the long sides of the table have armrests?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the block arrangements that resemble chairs do not distinctly show armrests as typical human chairs do; they are rudimentary block structures. No evident armrest-like feature is constructed within these blocks surrounding the table.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a centerpiece located in the center of the table?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a small structure resembling a green piece on a black circular base is placed in the center of the table, suggesting the function of a centerpiece. The distinctiveness and centralized position imply it acts as a centerpiece.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the furniture set placed on a flat, level surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the block-based setup is depicted on a base layer that appears flat and level, simulating a typical surface or floor. This is consistent with a common expectation of furniture placement for stability.",
    "answer": "Yes"
