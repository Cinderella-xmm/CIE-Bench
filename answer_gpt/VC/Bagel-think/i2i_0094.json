      "question": "Is the Nikon branding visible and legible in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible label on the camera but the text is altered or stylized to fit a steampunk theme. It initially appears to resemble the Nikon branding but upon closer inspection, the text seems distorted or changed. In Image A, the Nikon branding is clear and legible, confirming that Image B has altered the branding. Therefore, the Nikon branding is not legible in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the lens positioned centrally on the camera body in the steampunk illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera lens is indeed positioned centrally within the camera body, which is typical for SLR cameras to allow optimal image capture. World knowledge of camera design in photography informs this understanding. Comparing Image A, the same central positioning of the lens is observed, confirming the central placement.",

      "question": "Is the tripod still visibly connected to the camera through a central mount?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the camera mounted on a tripod with a clearly visible central connection, similar to what is standard in camera setups where stability is important, aligning with the common design logic. Image A also shows a central mounting on the tripod, confirming Image B's adherence to this detail.",

      "question": "Are the relative proportions of the camera body, lens, and tripod maintained in the steampunk rendition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions between the camera body, lens, and tripod are consistent with typical camera setups, even though the aesthetic is steampunk with exaggerated and ornamental elements. The comparison with Image A shows a similar proportion between the components, suggesting that Image B maintains relative proportions and camera design principles despite stylistic changes.",

      "question": "Does the illustration retain a clear depiction of metallic textures on the camera and tripod?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features metallic textures, which align with steampunk themes emphasizing mechanical and metal features. The lenses, gears, and tripod components show detailed metallic surfaces, utilizing a bronze/copper-like color scheme. Image A primarily showcases a standard camera with a smoother plastic texture, but Image B distinctly enhances metallic textures as part of its design.",
