      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the mustache present and shaped in a way that matches the original image, with a curved, thick form extending from both sides of the upper lip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is a toy with a simple face design that does not include a mustache. Comparing it to Image A, which showcases a realistic portrait of an individual, including facial hair, there is a clear distinction. The absence of any facial hair on the toy confirms that the mustache does not exist in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the hair retain its wild, voluminous, and unevenly distributed white appearance, particularly with strands extending outward from the sides and top of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toy's hair appears wild, voluminous, and similarly distributed as depicted in Image A, where the hair also exhibits a messy and voluminous white appearance. The visual similarity confirms the answer.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there vertical black stripes running down the front of the sweater, matching the pattern seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toy's sweater displays a pattern of black stripes. The pattern is horizontal across the sweater, unlike the horizontal pattern in Image A, which has no distinct pattern due to a blurred region. Therefore, based on the visible parts, the stripes are horizontal (not as seen in Image A), confirming the answer.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, below the sweater's neckline on the toy, no light-colored shirt collar is visible. Comparing with Image A showing a collar beneath the sweater's neckline reflects a difference between the two regarding this element.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the eyes, nose, and forehead lines maintain their original relative positions and shapes, such as the horizontal creases on the forehead and the oval shape of the eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toy expresses a simplistic facial appearance with basic features such as circular eyes and no visible horizontal forehead lines that matches Image A's human-like features with distinctive forehead lines and specifically shaped eyes. Thus, the features in Image B differ from those in Image A.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sweater in Image B on the toy contains a textured ribbed pattern, shown consistently across the neckline and shoulder areas. Image A showcases a natural fabric appearance with no distinctive ribbed pattern. The sweater’s texture in Image B differs from Image A, confirming the answer.",
