      "question": "Is the background composed of flowing, curved lines made of multicolored bokeh lights in red, orange, blue, purple, and teal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features flowing, curved lines with a vibrant and smooth transition of colors, including shades of red, orange, blue, purple, and teal. These colors have a uniform appearance common in digital art rather than resembling multicolored bokeh lights, which are more random and scattered in appearance. Therefore, even though the colors are similar, the background is not composed of bokeh lights.",

      "question": "Does the beige coat retain a visible woolen texture with detailed folds and surface variation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the coat appears smooth, lacking the detailed woolen texture that would typically show small fibers, variations, and slight irregularities across its surface. The texture appears more uniform and resembles an illustration style, missing the natural fabric details seen in the original photograph.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scarf shows a smooth and simplified representation without visible patterns or texture detailing. Unlike a photographic image where fabric texture and any patterns would be apparent, the scarf here appears to be solid-colored with no intricate pattern visible.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no gold-rimmed sunglasses depicted over the eyes. Instead, what is visible is a stylized interpretation without clear signs of aviator sunglasses, showing simplified shapes that do not distinctly match or indicate eyewear.",

      ],
