        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child is depicted using mosaic tiles, which gives it a distinct appearance in terms of texture and detailing compared to Image A. The general shape and pose of the child are recognizable and consistent with the original image while the mosaic tiles add an artistic rendition. Therefore, despite the change in artistic style, the child's shape and position remain similar.",

        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the round red balloon is depicted using mosaic tiles, similar to the child. The shape and position of the balloon relative to the child are consistent with the positioning in Image A. Despite the variation in artistic style, the balloon is clearly recognizable in terms of its shape and position.",

        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the heart-shaped balloon is also depicted using mosaic tiles, while maintaining a consistent shape and position relative to Image A. The tile mosaic adds a stylistic difference, but the overall form and location of the heart-shaped balloon remain unchanged.",

        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child's gesture of reaching is preserved in the mosaic tile representation, maintaining the original intent and positioning of the pose. The arm is shown extending towards the heart-shaped balloon, indicating the same action as in Image A.",

        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the relative positions between the child, the round red balloon, and the heart-shaped balloon are preserved, matching their spatial arrangement from Image A. The mosaic tile depiction does not alter the relative distance or positioning among these elements.",
