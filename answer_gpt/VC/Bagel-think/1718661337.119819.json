      "question": "Is the white powdered wig with tightly curled sides still present on the figure's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image B shows a historical figure wearing a white powdered wig with tightly curled sides. This is consistent with the traditional depiction of such figures, often seen as part of period attire during the 18th century. The presence of the wig indicates the adherence to this stylistic element.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the figure wear a tricorne hat with a dark blue base and gold trim around the brim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tricorne hat is distinctly brown rather than dark blue, and gold trim around the brim is not present. The color and details do not match the description of a dark blue hat with gold trim.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the figure's right hand extended forward, gripping a bell-like object, with the thumb and fingers wrapped around it, suggesting continuity in the original hand position and action.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left hand is visible near the lower torso and appears to be positioned in a manner that would suggest the palm is facing inward or downward, similar to traditional poses.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features in Image B are not distinguishable, so analysis based solely on Image B cannot confirm the details of facial features like the nose, eyes, or jawline.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the figure in a classic three-quarter pose, facing slightly to the right, which is common for figure portraits to create a dynamic perspective with the body angled toward the viewer.",
