    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the baroque-style scrollwork and acanthus leaf motifs present and accurately reproduced in the same positions and forms as in the original clock frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe the inner part of the packaging lid that features intricate carvings similar to baroque scrollwork and acanthus motifs, much like the ornate frame in Image A. However, considering the nature of a wristwatch box, the carvings might not be in the exact positions or forms as on the original clock frame. This assessment emphasizes the packaging design while retaining the artistic theme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the symmetrical arrangement of the top and bottom finials and side scrollwork preserved exactly as in the original clock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original clock in Image A features a specific symmetrical design with certain finials and scrollwork placements. In Image B, the watch box does bear aesthetic similarities but may not replicate the exact symmetry and arrangement due to the difference in form and application. Therefore, while themes might be consistent, the exact arrangements are likely not duplicated.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the rich mahogany tone and visible wood grain texture of the frame preserved in the packaging design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a watch box with a rich brownish tone and potentially visible wood grain, reminiscent of the original clock frame in Image A. The color and texture in Image B appear to align with a mahogany-like appearance, suggesting a deliberate design choice to echo the clock's aesthetic.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the distressed gold finish of the clock face preserved in the watch face within the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the clock face has a distinctive distressed gold finish. Examining the watch in Image B, it appears to have a similar gold hue that is less distressed, given the polished nature typical of wristwatches. Hence, while the color is maintained, the texture looks more refined.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the black Roman numerals (I–XII) present in the same positions and style as in the original clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B feature a clock/watch face with Roman numerals displayed in a classic style. The numerals I–XII, a traditional feature, appear to be consistently placed around both the original clock and the watch in the packaging.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the inscriptions \"2010\" and \"2012\" present in the same positions on the clock/watch face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original clock face in Image A includes the inscriptions '2010' and '2012'. Upon inspection of Image B, these inscriptions are absent, as the watch face prioritizes brand or model information instead. This difference indicates that the specific inscriptions were not carried over into the watch design.",
