      "question": "Are the floral and foliate engraved patterns visible on the body of the transformed owl, arranged symmetrically between vertical ribs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl's body is adorned with various details, including gears and mechanical elements, rather than floral and foliate engravings. The emphasis is on a steampunk aesthetic with mechanical components. In Image A, the teapot displays floral and foliate engravings arranged in panels with vertical ribs. The transformation to the owl's body results in a departure from this symmetric floral patterning, focusing instead on mechanical and ornate gear designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the transformed owl retain a shiny, polished metallic surface consistent with the original teapot’s finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl's surface has a combination of textures, including metallic parts, but the overall impression is of a more varied and less uniformly polished surface compared to Image A, where the teapot has a uniform shiny, polished metallic finish. The owl incorporates many materials and textures, deviating from the teapot's lustrous consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the beak of the mechanical owl shaped like the original teapot’s curved spout, extending forward and slightly upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl's beak is small, straight, and pointed, resembling a more traditional owl beak. In Image A, the teapot features a curved spout that extends forward and curves upward. These are distinctly different in shape and orientation, as the owl's beak does not mimic the teapot's curved spout.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the tail of the mechanical owl follow the same graceful C-shaped curve as the original teapot’s handle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl's tail is depicted as part of a branch rather than resembling the teapot's handle. The branch in the owl image is dark brown and straight, supporting the entire owl. In contrast, Image A shows a C-shaped, ornate handle. The owl's tail does not replicate this C-shaped gracefulness of the handle.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the crown-like head of the mechanical owl include a pointed, tiered finial matching the original teapot’s lid top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl’s head features horns or feather-like extensions above the eyes but lacks a tiered, pointed finial. Image A features a teapot lid with a distinct pointed, tiered finial atop it. The owl's head design is more stylized like feather plumes rather than a finial.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the body segments of the mechanical owl divided into vertical ribs, each housing a decorative motif, mirroring the original teapot’s structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl's body incorporates mechanical and ornamental elements, like gears, rather than ribbed segments housing motifs. Although decorative, the owl's theme is steampunk rather than segmental like the teapot. Image A shows the teapot with vertical rib divisions with decorative motifs, a feature not mirrored in the owl's design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the ornamental scrollwork present at the base of the mechanical owl’s tail, corresponding to the original handle’s end?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl has no visible scrollwork at the base of what serves as its tail, primarily depicted as a branch. The original Image A’s teapot handle ends with noticeable ornamental scrollwork. The owl's tail lacks such ornamentation, being part of the perch rather than a detailed tail extension.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the tail of the mechanical owl rendered in a dark brown tone consistent with the original handle’s color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tail of the owl, represented as a branch, is indeed dark brown. Comparing this to Image A, where the teapot’s handle is also dark brown, suggests that the color consistency is maintained for what stands as the owl's tail or branch in the steampunk sculpture.",
