      "question": "Is the dancer depicted in an arabesque leap with one leg extended behind and arms forming a diagonal line?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer inside the snow globe is shown in a ballet pose with one leg raised upward rather than extended behind her. Her arms are raised; however, they do not form a distinct diagonal line. Common knowledge of ballet positions suggests that the dancer is positioned in a classic ballet pose, but not specifically an arabesque leap, which typically involves an extended back leg.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the Eiffel Tower retain its characteristic iron lattice structure and three-tiered design with a spire at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Eiffel Tower inside the snow globe in Image B is represented with intricate details that include a spire but lacks the detailed iron lattice structure. This representation is more simplified compared to the realistic structure, which is typical for scaled-down models such as those found in snow globes.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are both feet of the dancer wearing pointe shoes with visible ribbons and box-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is depicted wearing what appear to be pointe shoes. However, due to the artistic rendering within the snow globe, the shoes are simplified, and ribbons are not clearly visible as they are in real pointe shoes, which typically have a box-like structure visible with ribbons tied around the ankle.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the dancerâ€™s head turned to face the Eiffel Tower, indicating forward gaze toward it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's head is facing forward, possibly toward the Eiffel Tower. However, due to the artistic depiction, it's not clear if she's strictly looking at the structure, as is the typical pose in ballet where focus may be forward but not necessarily directed towards one specific object.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the dancer wearing a leotard that is predominantly turquoise in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is dressed in a classic white ballet tutu, not a turquoise leotard, indicating a traditional ballet costume rather than a monochromatic leotard.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the dancer positioned in the foreground, clearly in front of the Eiffel Tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the snow globe of Image B, while the Eiffel Tower is present, the dancer is centered in the globe and is juxtaposed beside the tower rather than clearly in front, suggesting equal prominence in positioning within the globe environment.",
