      "question": "Does the transformed sculpture retain a central tall spire flanked by multiple smaller turrets arranged symmetrically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a noticeable tall central spire which is surrounded by smaller turrets on both sides, maintaining symmetry around the main spire. The design elements suggest an intentional symmetrical arrangement reflecting architectural stability. Image B's sculpture has retained the prominent structure found in typical castle designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there small red flags positioned at the tip of each turret of the crystal sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a castle made from crystal-like material. Observing the tips of the turrets, there are no red flags visible in this edited image. The crystal design seems to focus more on the translucent and reflective qualities rather than adding flags or other details seen in the original sandcastle image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the shovel located in the foreground, angled toward the base of the castle, and partially submerged in reflective water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture is enclosed in a glass display case. There is no shovel present at all. The image features just the detailed architectural design within a clean, artificial display setting without elements like water or beach tools that were part of Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the gemstones (replacing seashells) grouped in a cluster at the foot of the crystal castle, similar to the original shell arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are gemstones placed at the base of the crystal sculpture. They are grouped together, resembling the cluster of seashells seen in Image A, suggesting a similar arrangement around the castle's structure.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the frosted glass slab feature a continuous horizontal wave pattern that mimics the original ocean’s rolling motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of Image B includes a wavy pattern that can resemble wave-like motion. Though abstract and stylistically simplified compared to Image A’s realistic water scene, it does evoke the concept of waves or fluidity. The design echoes the natural dynamics seen in beach or ocean settings.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the tallest tower located centrally within the crystal sculpture, rising above all other structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tallest tower is indeed placed at the central top of the sculpture, surpassing all other structures in height. This central positioning is aligned with traditional castle architectures which emphasize grandeur and prominence in the middle of the design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the shovel retain a red blade and yellow handle, even if rendered in crystal or another material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include any shovel, red, yellow, or otherwise. The sculpture is made entirely of crystal with no accessories such as shovels, indicating a shift from the sandcastle theme of Image A to a purely decorative art piece without added elements.",
