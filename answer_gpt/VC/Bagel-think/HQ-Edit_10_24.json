      "question": "Is the girl’s mouth visibly open with red lips and rosy cheeks, indicating she is blowing bubbles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the region that would show the girl’s mouth is blurred. Therefore, there is no visible indication of the girl’s mouth being open, having red lips, or rosy cheeks. Thus, without detailed facial features, there cannot be any indication of her blowing bubbles.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl's hair appears to be long and wavy, consistent with the description, but not black; it is silver or light gray in color. Hence, the detail regarding black hair does not apply.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows lanterns lit and hanging around the girl, but they are not originating from her mouth, as the mouth is blurred. They are stylized elements decorating the scene rather than emerging from any specific source.",
