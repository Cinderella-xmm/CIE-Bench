      "question": "Is the brown, segmented, textured trunk of the palm tree present with visible horizontal ridges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm tree's trunk has a brown, segmented, textured appearance typical of palm trees. It is depicted with visible horizontal ridges, indicative of the segments in the palm trunk. This visual detail aligns with the common characteristics of palm trees, such as their textured and ridged trunks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the long, feathery green fronds forming a radial crown at the top of the palm tree present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The palm tree in Image B displays fronds that are long and feathery, forming a radial crown at the top. This presentation is aligned with the common structure of palm trees, where the fronds radiate from the top of the trunk to create a broad crown.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are some of the palm frond tips visibly browned or dried?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, none of the palm frond tips show visible browning or drying. The fronds appear uniformly green, and there are no signs indicating browning or drying commonly observed in natural palm trees.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the palm tree positioned to the left of the cactus and taller than it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm tree appears behind a frame held in a hand with digital artwork on it. Within this artwork, the placement and comparison typical to the original natural setup from Image A is not directly represented; hence, the question does not apply as the context is different.",
      "weight": 2,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the palm fronds primarily green in color, with some yellowing or browning at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fronds of the palm tree in Image B are primarily green without signs of yellowing or browning at the edges. This differs from natural palm trees where some aging or drying might be visible, indicating this depiction remains idealistically green.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the palm tree maintain a tall, narrow trunk with a broad, rounded crown of fronds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a palm tree with a stylized form where the trunk is depicted narrow and the crown of fronds appears broad creating a rounded effect. This maintains the general iconic silhouette of natural palm trees.",
