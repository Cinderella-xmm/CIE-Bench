      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is represented as a cartoon-like character. However, it retains the characteristic black and white stripes covering its body, albeit in a stylized and simplified form typical of cartoon representations, which are visually significant markers of a zebra's identity.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ears in Image B are upright, which aligns with a typical zebra's ear posture. Even though the zebra presented in this image is a cartoon, it retains this anatomical detail similar to the realistic version seen in Image A.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a stylized zebra rendition that includes a visible mane extending along its neck. This mane is a simplified version and part of typical stylizations for cartoon designs, allowing it to maintain the zebraâ€™s distinctive appearance found in real zebras as seen in Image A.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's tail is visible and stylized, again fitting with the overall cartoon appearance. There is a tuft of hair at the end of the tail, maintaining a distinct feature that aligns with real zebras, as demonstrated in Image A.",

      "explanation": "The zebra in Image B is depicted in a standing posture, similar to Image A. Despite its cartoon-like representation, the stance is characteristic of zebras, typically shown standing when not depicted in movement.",
