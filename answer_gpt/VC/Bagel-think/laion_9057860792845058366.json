      "question": "Are the two orange horn-like protrusions on the top of the robot's head present and unchanged in shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two orange horn-like protrusions are visible on the robot's head. They match the position and shape seen commonly in various robot designs for visual prominence. Comparing with Image A, the horns maintain the same appearance and location, indicating no change in their shape or position.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot's feet in Image B retain the angular, mechanical shape with black toe segments and red accent plates which are characteristic of its design. This matches the same features observed in Image A, with no modification.",
