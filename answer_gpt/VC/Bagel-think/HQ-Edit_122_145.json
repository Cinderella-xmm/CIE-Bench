      "question": "Is there a pink floral hair ornament with dangling tassels positioned at the top-right of the figure’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi keychain figures appear to have a floral ornament on their hair, including pink flowers, commonly used in traditional Japanese settings. Given the ornamental nature, tassels could be logically included as they complement such floral arrangements aesthetically. In Image A, the hair ornament includes both flowers and tassels. Therefore, it seems plausible that a similar style exists on the keychains in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a wide obi tied at the waist with a red-and-yellow patterned bow visible from the back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi illustrations feature an obi tied around the waist with visible red and yellow colors, indicating patterns. However, a bow seen from the back typical in traditional kimono styles may not be discernible in the front-facing cartoon representations. In Image A, the obi is clearly tied in a bow and visible from the back. Based on typical animated depictions and lack of view, Image B might not show the bow in the same manner.",

      "question": "Does the kimono have a dark blue base color with floral patterns overlaid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows the chibi figures wearing kimonos with apparent blue hues amid other colors for floral patterns. Traditional Japanese kimonos often feature bold colors and floral designs. In Image A, the kimono displays a dark blue base with bright floral patterns. Image B aligns with this palette, suggesting a similar base color.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the kimono composed of pink, red, and white blossoms resembling cherry blossoms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, floral patterns on the chibi keychains predominantly feature shades of pink, often the color associated with cherry blossoms. This is typical in the stylization of kimonos, matching cherry blossom symbolism. Image A showcases distinct pink, red, and white blossoms on the kimono resembling cherry blossoms, making it reasonable to conclude that Image B reflects this.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the figure depicted as a woman wearing a traditional Japanese kimono?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B provides a clear depiction of chibi figures in traditional Japanese kimonos, with feminine characteristics, ornamental flowers, and obi sashes indicating female representation. Image A reinforces this with a full depiction of a woman in kimono. Therefore, Image B showcases figures representative of women in traditional attire.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are cherry blossoms present either in the kimono pattern or as props (e.g., branch, falling petals) in the figure’s immediate vicinity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, despite its simplified form, uses cherry blossoms notably in the props like falling petals, which surround the chibi figures, adhering to cultural aesthetics. Image A similarly incorporates cherry blossoms both in the surroundings and on the kimono itself. This makes it logical for Image B to include such elements.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the obi positioned at the waist and tied in a bow at the back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the obi is visible at the waist, these small-scale caricatures often omit rear details like bows due to their front-facing design limits. In Image A, the aforementioned bow is visible at the back, supporting authentic interferences for Image B. Without visual confirmation from Image B, standard chibi limitations suggest a negative inference.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features chibi representations of the woman, and examining these shows a front-on perspective across all poses, common with the cartoon depictions emphasizing simplicity over aspirational side profiles. Image A depicts the woman frontally as well, confirming typical traditional appearances. Such an analysis suggests no side profiles in Image B.",
