      "question": "Is the subject's arms-raised pose preserved in the chibi-style figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figure has both arms raised, which is a recognizable and characteristic pose often used to convey excitement or action. Based on the visual cues, the figure's pose matches an arms-raised position commonly seen as a celebratory gesture. This indicates that the pose has been preserved from the original Image A, where the subject similarly has arms raised. The reasoning derives from understanding typical body language and the characteristic representation styles in chibi figures.",

      "question": "Are the multiple plates of burgers, fries, and drinks still present on the table in the same positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited chibi-style representation features miniature items on the table. Each plate has a burger and fries, and there are two drinks with visible condiment bottles, maintained symmetrically around the figure. Comparing this to Image A, we identify that the items are similarly placed around the subject, maintaining the same positions. This suggests the positions and array of table items have been faithfully retained during the stylization process.",

      "question": "Is the table still circular with a blue surface and metallic edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the chibi-style figure with a similar blue-surfaced round table with a metallic-looking edge, judging by the typical representation style that captures crucial elements of the original version. The editing retains the fundamental characteristics of the table's shape and color. By contrasting this with Image A, the consistency in shape and color indicates the feature has been preserved despite the shift in style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style image does not display any background booth surrounding the figure, focusing solely on the tabletop scene. Contrasting with Image A, where a visibly red booth encircles the human subject, the background has been omitted or intentionally not included. This exclusion suggests the stylization focused on the subject and table items rather than the surrounding context.",

      "question": "Does the chibi-style figure still display a cheerful facial expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blurred face of the chibi-style figure does not allow the assessment of its expression. However, given the prevalent design conventions of chibi figures typically conveying positive emotions, it is plausible the expression aligns with a cheerful demeanor. Without direct observation of expression due to the blurred edit, one must rely on design norms and context. Nevertheless, it's essential to adhere strictly to visible content.",
