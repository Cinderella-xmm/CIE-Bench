      "question": "Is the winding stone path composed of irregular flat stones leading upward toward the central structure present in the same location and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a stone path composed of irregular flat stones can be seen leading upwards toward a central structure, which is a towering tree instead of a castle. The stones seem to maintain the same arrangement and orientation as in Image A, allowing for an upward path toward a central visual focal point in both images.",

      "question": "Are the large, scattered rock formations visible along the grassy slope at the base of the structure preserved in their original positions and sizes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, large, scattered rock formations are visible along what appears to be a grassy path leading to a large tree. Comparing this to Image A, the rocks appear to be in similar positions and sizes, providing continuity along the path and contributing to the overall setting of both images.",
      "weight": 2,

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the tall, leafy trees forming a natural border on both the left and right edges of the image still present, maintaining their original height, density, and positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, tall leafy trees are visible, forming borders on both sides of the central tree structure. The trees appear dense and tall, similar to the arrangement in Image A, contributing to a natural backdrop and maintaining the overall forest-like environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sky above the castle still depicted with soft daylight and scattered white clouds against a pale blue background, preserving the original lighting quality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is indeed depicted with soft daylight and scattered white clouds against a pale blue background, similar to Image A. This maintains the lighting quality and contributes to a consistent mood across both images despite the change in the central element from a castle to a tree.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the hillside beneath the castle still gently sloped upward from the foreground, covered in green grass and supporting the stone path and rocks in their original configuration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the central structure has changed from a castle to a large tree with ethereal figures, the hillside beneath is gently sloped upward from the foreground, covered in green grass and supporting the stone path and rocks. The underlying terrain appears similar to Image A, with slight modifications to accommodate the edited scene.",
