      "question": "Is there visible steam rising from the broccoli/tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which depicts the broccoli as a tree in a forest setting, there is no visible indication of steam rising from the object. Typically, steam is visible as a misty, inconsistent flow above hot objects, but given the context of being in nature, steam is unlikely. Thus, based on visual evidence combined with common sense, there is no steam.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the broccoli/tree rest on a white plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the broccoli in a natural outdoor setting, featuring the tree planted in soil with surrounding forest elements. These elements suggest an environment far removed from a dining or kitchen context where a plate would be present. Therefore, based on visual cues and understanding of setting contexts, there is no white plate.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the broccoli/tree primarily green in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the broccoli is depicted as a tree, retaining the broccoli's natural green coloration for its 'canopy' or floret section. This aspect is evident visually and aligns with common knowledge of broccoli's appearance. Therefore, the primary color of the tree, as depicted, is green.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the characteristic florets of the broccoli discernible on the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the broccoli as a tree, and the top of this tree clearly resembles broccoli florets. The texture, rounded clumps, and dense formations are consistent with broccoli's natural floret structure. This resemblance makes the florets distinctly discernible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the broccoli/tree have a defined stem-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the broccoli/tree has a trunk that extends from the ground to support the florets, mimicking the stem of real broccoli. Visually, this trunk replicates the structure of the broccoli's stem, serving a similar functional role in the image's context as a tree.",
