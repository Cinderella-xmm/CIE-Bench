      "question": "Is the glass still recognizable as a standard cocktail glass with a cylindrical shape and a flat base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass maintains a cylindrical shape similar to what is typically seen in cocktail glasses, with a visible flat base. The overall structure of the glass remains unchanged in shape, aligning with standard cocktail glass characteristics. The analysis is based on the visual cues showing a uniformly cylindrical body with a round base, commonly associated with cocktail glasses.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible ice cubes in the glass, maintaining the appearance of a chilled beverage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shapes within the glass resemble ice cubes. Although the visual style is altered and abstract, the presence of these shapes is indicative of ice cubes, commonly associated with a chilled beverage. The visual cues support this reasoning with shapes that mimic the form and positioning of ice cubes inside a glass.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a slice of lime garnishing the rim of the glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an object resembling a slice of lime placed on the rim of the glass. It matches the expected location and shape of a lime garnish frequently found in cocktails. Despite the altered artistic style, the resemblance is close enough to affirm its representation as a lime slice.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a metallic straw inserted into the cocktail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image includes an object positioned vertically inside the glass, replicating the form of a straw, but it doesn't have the metallic appearance presented in Image A. Given the abstract style of Image B, we cannot definitively identify the straw as metallic based solely on its color or texture.",

      "question": "Does the surface beneath the cocktail retain a polished wooden texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface beneath the glass in Image B does not visually retain a polished wooden texture. Instead, it presents a smooth and uniform texture which lacks the distinguishable grain or sheen characteristic of polished wood, indicating materials other than those typically associated with a wooden surface.",
