      "question": "Is the flared leg silhouette preserved in the transformed design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual analysis shows a bottle with a broad base, possibly hinting at flare-like features; however, the object is a bottle, not clothing with a silhouette like jeans. In Image A, jeans with flared legs are evident. Comparing both, Image B does not depict clothing, so the flared leg silhouette is not preserved.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the lace-up details present on the outer sides of the lower legs in the transformed design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a bottle with no lace-up details. In Image A, lace-ups are visible at the bottom sides of jeans. Comparing Image A with Image B, the transformed design does not retain these lace-up features.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the denim blue color retained in the transformed design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a bottle with a blue color gradient reminiscent of denim shades. In Image A, the jeans are a solid denim blue. The transformed design retains a shade of blue similar to denim, making the comparison evident.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the side profile view maintained in the transformed design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a frontal view of a bottle, not a side profile. Image A displays jeans in a clear side profile. The transition from Image A to Image B does not retain the side profile perspective.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle displays consistent width from top to bottom without tapering, whereas Image A shows jeans with tapering from knee to a flare at the ankle. Thus, the transformed design does not retain this proportional length and tapering characteristic.",
