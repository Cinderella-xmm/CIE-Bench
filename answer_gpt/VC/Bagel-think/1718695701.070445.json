    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the capybara’s snout shape — including the rounded nose, wide mouth, and visible teeth — preserved in the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible part of the sculpture shows a helmet which seems to cover the face completely, thus obscuring any detailed snout, nose, mouth, or teeth features. Based on this visual information, the snout shape is not discernible. In Image A, the original capybara's snout is distinct with a wide nose and visible teeth. The sculpture doesn't reveal these features as the helmet obscures them.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the white muzzle area, positioned centrally on the face and extending from the nose to the upper lip, preserved in the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture's helmet design doesn't allow for any distinct muzzle area to be visible due to the helmet completely covering the front facial area. In Image A, the capybara's muzzle is quite visibly central and white. Based on this analysis, the sculpture doesn't preserve this aspect of the capybara.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the whiskers present and arranged in the same radial pattern from the snout as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the helmet obscuring the face of the sculpture, whiskers are not visible. In Image A, the capybara's whiskers are very noticeable and arranged radially from the snout. The absence of visible whiskers in the sculpture indicates that this feature is not preserved.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the glasses positioned directly over the eyes, with the frame aligned horizontally across the bridge of the nose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B has a helmet obscuring where the eyes would be, making it impossible for glasses to be positioned over any eyes. Image A clearly shows glasses positioned directly over the capybara's eyes. Therefore, the sculpture does not maintain this feature.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sweater and shoulder straps positioned on the shoulders and torso in the same way as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture does not show any indication of clothing like a sweater or shoulder straps. In contrast, Image A clearly features a capybara wearing a sweater and straps that are visible on the shoulders and torso. Therefore, these elements are not part of the sculpture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the capybara’s head shape — rounded, broad, and proportionally large relative to the body — preserved in the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a sculpture with a helmet, which could potentially cover a head of similar shape, but this cannot be confirmed as the head shape is not definitively visible due to the helmet covering. In Image A, the capybara's head is unmistakably rounded and broad. Without visible cues, we can't confirm the shape is preserved in the sculpture.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the mouth depicted as slightly open, revealing the teeth, in the same manner as the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the helmet in the sculpture in Image B, the mouth and teeth are not visible. In Image A, the capybara's mouth is open, revealing teeth clearly. Since the sculpture's helmet covers the frontal facial features where the mouth is, this detail is not preserved.",
