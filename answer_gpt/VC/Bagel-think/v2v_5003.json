      "question": "Does the edited image retain the curved shape of the bow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the bow exhibits a noticeably angular and geometric design rather than a smooth curvature, which is unconventional for bows that typically have a rounded curve. In Image A, the bow clearly has a smooth and traditional curved form. The edited image has altered the bow from its original curved shape to a more angular, origami-like one.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the cylindrical shape of the quiver?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quiver is transformed into a more geometric structure, with distinct angular facets, resembling an origami design. This contrasts with the cylindrical, seamless shape observed in Image A. The edit alters the cylindrical form significantly, giving it a folded and angular appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the arrangement and general form of the arrows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents arrows with angular, paper-like flights, changing their form and arrangement from the original Image A. In Image A, the arrows possess conventional feathered flights. While they are positioned similarly, Image B modifies their design significantly, from realistic feathers to origami structures.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the position of the bow and quiver on the forest floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reflects that both the bow and the quiver remain situated similarly on the forest floor as in Image A, indicating that the spatial arrangement has not been altered. The primary difference lies in the design with the alteration to their surfaces, not their placement.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the natural woodland backdrop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The backdrop in Image B continues to show a forest setting with similar visual cues, such as the moss and woodland ambiance, as seen in Image A. Despite the changes to the subjects in the image, the natural, blurred woodland environment is preserved.",
