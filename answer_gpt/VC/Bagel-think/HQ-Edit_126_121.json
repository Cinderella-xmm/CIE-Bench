      "question": "Are the gorilla’s eyes golden-yellow in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the area where the gorilla's eyes would be is intentionally blurred, preventing accurate determination of the eye color. The image design suggests intentional obscuring, hinting that the eyes are not meant to be the focus, which critically implies that any specific traits of the eyes are not discernible. Hence, with the available visual cues, the most logical deduction is that the image does not show golden-yellow eyes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a prominent silver-colored crest on the top of the gorilla’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla's head is clearly visible but not obscured by blurring. The area that would be a crest in some gorillas appears to simply be part of the naturally thick, dark fur, with no distinctive silver coloration observed. Given typical gorilla anatomy, if a gorilla had such a crest, it would be more visibly distinct, yet in this image, it seems to blend into the rest of the gorilla's head. Therefore, the answer is based on the absence of distinguishing features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the banana bunch composed of multiple yellow bananas curving outward from a common stem?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bananas in Image B are clearly discernible with detailed visual representation showing a cluster of yellow bananas, each curving outwards from a common stem. Observing such a configuration is a typical representation of bananas in their bunch form, confirming their natural growth pattern and supporting this visual characteristic.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both of the gorilla’s hands actively holding the banana bunch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla is depicted with both its arms positioned around the bananas, suggesting an active engagement or holding of the banana bunch. These hands are visibly placed such that one cannot be convinced otherwise without speculative reasoning, implying the hands are indeed grasping or supporting the banana bunch from either side.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the gorilla have thick, dark fur with visible texture and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction of the gorilla in Image B emphasizes its thick, dark fur. The resolution and artistic style bring out a detailed texture and depth in the fur, characteristic of a realistic portrayal. This textured appearance emphasizes the realistic density and richness associated with gorillas, supporting the perception of these traits of the fur.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the gorilla facing directly forward, making eye contact with the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the section where the gorilla's eyes would be is intentionally blurred, the posture and alignment of the gorilla's form in Image B suggests a forward-facing position. Even with the eyes obscured, the overall stance aligns with a typical forward-facing direction, which supports the conception that the gorilla appears to engage with the viewer as reflected in typical forward-facing postures.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question": "Do the bananas have visible brown spots and slight blemishes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bananas show clear details with slight brown spots and blemished characteristics, which are common in real bananas at a certain ripeness stage. These details are visually evident, showcasing a natural appearance, supporting this observation as part of the visual narrative.",
