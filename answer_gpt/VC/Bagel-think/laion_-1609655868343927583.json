      "question": "Is the herringbone wood inlay pattern present on the surface of the transformed character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the transformed character has been altered to resemble a regal figure with a new elaborate white and jeweled appearance, lacking any wood inlay patterns. In Image A, a clear herringbone wood inlay is visible on the cabinet surface. The alteration in Image B does not include this pattern. Hence, the herringbone wood inlay is not present in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the circular brass ring pulls and adjacent escutcheons present on the transformed character’s waist area, matching their original positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed character does appear to have circular objects where drawers would be, located at the side of the character that can be thought of as the 'waist area'. However, these features have been integrated into new, curved, outer features and are not exactly in the same position as in Image A, where the cabinet has ring pulls and escutcheons on flat drawer fronts. The placement and usage of these ornaments are altered significantly in Image B.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the transformed character retain the original warm amber-brown wood color as the base tone of its body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the transformed character is depicted as white with decorative elements, diverging significantly from the warm amber-brown wood tone seen in Image A. The original wood color does not appear to be preserved in the transformed image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the transformed character’s feet retain small brass caps at their ends, corresponding to the original leg caps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed character possesses legs that end in animal-like feet, which are entirely distinct from the straight wooden legs with brass caps seen in Image A. Therefore, the transformed character's feet do not retain the original small brass caps.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the legs of the transformed character still tapered, narrowing from top to bottom, consistent with the original cabinet legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, Image B, the legs have been changed into what look like animal legs with talons, losing the tapering feature seen in Image A, where the cabinet legs are classic tapered legs, narrowing towards the bottom. The character's legs in the transformed image are not tapered.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the two drawers/pouches positioned vertically one above the other on the transformed character, maintaining their original stacking order?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays transformed vertical pouches that resemble a series of drawers stacked one above the other. This configuration parallels Image A, where the drawers are indeed placed vertically. While the context has changed due to the transformation, the basic vertical arrangement remains intact.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the brass foliate motif visible on the side of the transformed character’s torso, in the same location as the original cabinet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the side designs seen on Image A have been completely altered to fit a new character theme. The brass foliate motifs seen on the sides of the cabinet in Image A are not visible in Image B, where the 'torso' region aesthetically diverges into decorated robes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Does the crown portion of the transformed character retain the original semi-circular edge shape of the marble top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while a crown has been added to the transformed character, the shape is not sem-circular, but rather prominently circular and ornate. Image A features a clear semi-circular marble top on the cabinet. Thus, the semi-circular shape is not retained for the crown portion.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Do the transformed pouches retain a dark interior, suggesting depth and openness, consistent with the original drawer interiors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the interior of the pouches is represented as dark, akin to the original drawers in Image A, suggesting similar depth and openness. This visual consistency suggests that the interiors have retained their depth despite the transformational theme.",
