    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the creature’s back or head feature a series of upward-pointing, layered spires that mimic the original building’s roofline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature has wings with pointed tips and a head crest that point upwards, which could be seen as mimicking the upward-pointing, layered spires of the original building in Image A. Both designs involve pointed elements reaching upwards, although the creature's features are biological rather than architectural.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the creature’s body composed of or covered in a golden-hued, metallic material matching the original building’s exterior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B appears to have a metallic luster, and while it isn't exactly golden, it exhibits a color that might be perceived as somewhat reflective or metallic. Image A's building is distinctly golden due to the lighting, but the creature's coloring does not directly match this exactly.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a reflective water surface directly beneath the creature, mirroring its form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any reflective water surface beneath the creature, whereas Image A clearly has a reflective water surface mirroring the building. In the creature's image, it seems to be standing on a solid base without such reflections.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the creature exhibit a symmetrical, octagonal or radial body structure consistent with the original building’s layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B does not present an octagonal or radial symmetry akin to the building's structure in Image A. The creature is asymmetrically posed and its body structure is not designed in a geometric pattern that resembles the building's shape.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are arched window-like structures or column-like protrusions visible on the creature’s body, echoing the original building’s features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image of the creature does not have distinct arched window-like structures or external column-like features as seen on the building in Image A. The surface of the creature is more organically contoured and lacks architectural features.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the scene illuminated with warm, golden-hour lighting, creating long shadows and a soft glow on the creature and surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is bright and has a somewhat mystical or ethereal glow, rather than the warm, golden-hour lighting seen in Image A. The creature is more evenly lit without the evident long shadows and warm tones that indicate golden-hour lighting.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are tall trees with autumn-colored leaves visible in the background behind the creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is more blurred, and does not prominently feature trees with autumn-colored leaves unlike in Image A where such trees are visible around the building.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is there a stone platform beneath the creature with inscribed plinths, similar to those under the original building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B is positioned on a type of pedestal, which appears smooth and unornamented, lacking any visible inscription or decorative elements similar to the plinths under the building in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Does the creature feature a triangular, transparent or glass-like panel in its upper section, matching the original building’s design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B does not have features resembling a triangular, transparent or glass-like panel as seen in the building in Image A. The creature's form does not include any similar design elements.",
