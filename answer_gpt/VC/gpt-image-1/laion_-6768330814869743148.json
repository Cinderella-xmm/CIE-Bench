      "question": "Are there exactly four wooden trays arranged in a 2x2 grid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trays are arranged in a 2x2 grid pattern. However, the trays are not depicted as being made of wood due to their artistic, colorful style that resembles a mosaic pattern instead. The grid arrangement is apparent through the organized positioning of the trays.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the madeleines retain their distinctive shell-shaped form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Madeleine' label matches with the lower right tray, which contains round pastries rather than the traditional shell shape of madeleines. This artistic representation suggests that the distinct shell shape is not retained.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Madeleine' label is placed above round-shaped pastries in the bottom-right tray, rather than shell-shaped ones. The pastries visually resemble muffins or cupcakes, not conventional shell-shaped madeleines.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trays do not feature any engraved text, including 'craster.' Instead, they are decorated with bold, colorful designs, devoid of text.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is artistic representation of yellow backgrounds inside the trays, which resemble parchment paper. However, it's an artistic depiction without the texture or appearance of real parchment paper.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pastries in the top-right tray are colorful oval shapes with a spiral design, slightly flattened in its artistic style. This matches the description.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom-left tray contains rectangular shapes resembling sliced loaf bread. The pastries are depicted in such a way to suggest an internal texture, reflecting an artistic version of bread with visible texture cues.",
