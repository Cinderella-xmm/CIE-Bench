      "question": "Is there visible sunlight reflecting off the water surface, creating bright sparkles and highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene depicts a mythical aquatic dragon rather than a natural waterfall. The edited image features an artistic representation with deep colors mainly in shades of blue and green. The focus is on the dragon's scales and mystical aura rather than realistic water details. Hence, sunlight sparkles and highlights are not visibly reflected on any water surface.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a cascade or flowing water typical of natural settings. The background features fantasy elements with clouds and mist around the dragon without indicating any foamy water along edges.",
