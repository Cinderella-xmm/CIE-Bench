      "question": "Is the mug still predominantly turquoise blue in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mug appears primarily blue with various shades of blue and yellow tones filling in the contours. The use of these colors may be representative of artistic techniques or stylistic choices. However, it does not resemble a turquoise shade. Combining world knowledge of the color spectrum indicates that the edited image is more of a blue shade overall rather than turquoise blue.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the mug retain its round shape with a handle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts an object that clearly resembles a mug in terms of roundness and the visible presence of a handle on the right side, confirming it retains the typical mug shape. The brush strokes resemble what an artistic depiction of pottery might look like, maintaining the curvature and structure associated with a mug.",

      "question": "Is there a circular coaster under the mug?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's a dark area under the mug, shaped somewhat circularly, with looks consistent with a coaster positioned below a mug. The edit introduces vibrant artistic colors, but the typical positioning and shadowing confirm its presence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the beverage level in the mug still visibly filled to a similar height as the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an area in the mug filled up with a lighter color representing the beverage. While the texture and strokes differ from the original depiction, the artistic depiction maintains a semblance of ongoing consistency with the filled level of the original, showing that the editing considers this positioning.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the mug still centrally positioned on the coaster?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the mug sitting atop a darker circular shape, likely intended as a coaster, placed directly underneath the mug, suggesting it holds central positioning similar to its original counterpart. Artistic abstraction doesn't alter alignment between mug and base.",
