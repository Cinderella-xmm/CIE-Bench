      "question": "Does the plastic figurine still hold a hammer that glows with blue lightning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plastic figurine is holding a hammer that is depicted with glowing blue lightning effects around it. This is consistent with the portrayal of Thor's hammer in various media, where it is shown to have lightning powers. The glow and lightning are clearly visible in Image B, suggesting the special effects have been retained from any original representation of the hammer.",

      "question": "Is the detailed black armor with metallic and gold accents retained on the figurine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plastic figurine is wearing armor that is black with metallic and gold accents. The armor design is detailed, similar to depictions of Thor's armor in films and comic books, with textures and patterns suggesting layers and segments. This matches the expected style of armor for a Thor character and confirms the detailed design has been retained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine is shown wearing a red cape draped over its shoulders, which is a distinctive and consistent feature of Thor's costume. The cape is clear and visible, aligning with the classic appearance associated with Thor across various portrayals.",

      "question": "Does the figurine retain Thor's beard and long blond hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine has long blond hair which is a prominent feature of Thorâ€™s character design, but no beard is visible. The presence of long blond hair aligns with common depictions of Thor but the absence of a beard suggests a deviation from some classic portrayals. Since the beard is not seen in the figurine, the representation is not entirely accurate.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the figurine maintain the same standing pose as depicted in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the figurine in a standing position holding the hammer down and to the side with lightning effects, similar to a powerful and heroic stance, but the pose slightly differs from Image A where the arm holding the hammer is bent more at the elbow. The figurine's pose is inspired by heroic and confronting cues; however, a precise evaluation against the original would note the pose is not identical.",
