      "question": "Is the mustache present with its original shape, including upward curls at the ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows no clear visual cues of a mustache with upward curls at the ends. Pop art style often involves exaggerated features, but here the focus is on the colorful patterns rather than specific facial hair details. Comparing to Image A, where facial hair might be visible, Image B lacks any distinct mustache portrayal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both eyes visible and positioned symmetrically with the bridge of the nose aligned centrally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show clear facial details due to the pop art style and facial blurring. Typically, symmetry in human facial features includes such positioning, but this cannot be determined due to the artistic style which doesn't present these elements distinctly. Comparing to Image A, where this facial symmetry might be assessed, Image B maintains an artistic abstraction.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hairline clearly defined with a receding pattern at the temples?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pattern of colors and style hinders definite identification of hairline patterns such as a receding hairline. Pop art styles often abstract, thereby obscuring detailed hairline visibility. Comparing to Image A, where such features might be more discernible, Image B lacks the clarity needed to evaluate the hairline pattern.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bow tie located at the center of the neck, forming a symmetrical knot beneath the collar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a bow tie centered under the collar, maintaining symmetry, typical of formal wear positioning seen in both artistic and realistic portrayals. Comparing to Image A, both images reflect the central positioning of the bow tie characteristic of formal attire.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the text \"S. W. Kramer.\" present below the image in the same font and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no text visible below the image. Common pop art styles focus on visual rather than textual elements and any text related details would typically be omitted or altered compared to traditional photographs as seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the subjectâ€™s head turned slightly to the left, with the body facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, being stylized art, does not offer clear depiction of body orientation or head turn, seen in realistic photographs. The absence of typical facial context makes it challenging to assess the direction of the head. Even in Image A, slight head turn might be difficult to determine precisely without clear cues.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the image framed within a rectangular border with visible margins on all sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is surrounded by a border featuring bright colors and patterns typical in pop art illustrations, but it does maintain a visible margin around the image area similar to traditional photography borders. Comparing to Image A, where a standard rectangular frame is consistent, Image B has a stylized version of framing.",
