      "question": "Are the black-and-white half-timbered gable ends visible and positioned at the top of the central and right-side sections of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building facade has a distinct black-and-white half-timbered design at the top, typical of Tudor-style architecture. This design is visible at the top center and top right of the building, consistent with known architectural styles. Comparison with Image A confirms this positioning, as it shows the same architectural feature placed centrally and on the right side of the building.",

      "question": "Is there a black arched door located on the left side of the building, embedded within the brick wall below the window ledge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a decorative arched design is visible on the left side embedded within the red brick wall, typical of classical architectural features. The design mimics the appearance of a door, although it doesn't fully replicate a real door. In Image A, the black arched door is distinctly present, confirming its placement on the actual building.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features the sign 'Leeds Parkway Hotel' on the awning, positioned directly above and aligned with the entrance doors.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, rectangular planters are stylized and appear on both sides of the entrance, similarly positioned along the base of the building. However, these planters are visually abstract and don't include colorful flowers. Image A shows these planters more realistically, with colorful plants visible. Therefore, the planters exist but lack colorful flowers in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a stylized facade featuring multiple windows with grid designs typical of traditional architecture. However, this does not include dormer or bay windows. In Image A, the windows are detailed with the mentioned features, confirming the absence of such specificity in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entrance doors are prominently depicted under the awning, centrally placed, and designed to resemble wooden doors with glass panels, consistent with common entrance designs for hotels. Image A also presents this configuration, confirming its accuracy.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building's lower section features a red-brick design with an arched motif on the left side, suggesting classical styling but without a functional door. Image A confirms this real-world feature, showing the brickwork and arched black door. Image B reflects the design but not the function.",
