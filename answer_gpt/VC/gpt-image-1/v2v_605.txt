    "Question": "Q1: Is the gorilla depicted with predominantly dark gray to black fur?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character, which is stylized to resemble a gorilla, has a toy-like appearance with a shiny, smooth surface. Despite the stylization, the color of the gorilla character is predominantly dark gray, suggestive of a gorilla’s typical fur color. This aligns with common depictions of gorillas, where they are often shown with darker fur. The toy's color choice is deliberate to reflect that of a real gorilla, although in a more playful, caricature-like form.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the gorilla have dark, almost black skin on its face?",
    "explanation": "The face and skin areas of the character in Image B are designed to simulate the skin of a gorilla, with a similar color palette. The visual cues suggest a dark coloring typical of a gorilla’s skin, albeit simplified for the toy's design. The designers have used a similar dark shade for both the fur and skin areas to maintain a coherent aesthetic typical for toys of this type.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the gorilla shown with a broad, muscular chest and visible pectoral definition?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the toy character is stylized and lacks detailed muscular definition, as it adopts a chibi form that does not emphasize anatomical accuracy. While the toy suggests a strong appearance, it does not have the realistic muscular definition that would be recognized from a real gorilla or from Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Is there a lighter-colored area on the gorilla’s back and shoulders, indicative of a silverback?",
    "explanation": "The toy character in Image B features no distinctive lighter-colored areas on the back and shoulders that would suggest a silverback gorilla. The depiction is a playful representation without specific detail to accurately simulate age or rank as a silverback in gorillas.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the gorilla have a broad, flat nose and prominent brow ridges?",
    "explanation": "The toy character in Image B is crafted with exaggerated and simplified features in line with toy design, which is intended to represent a gorilla. These toys typically include broad, flat facial features, such as the nose and eyebrow area, to keep it recognizable as a gorilla but without the nuanced detail of real anatomy.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the gorilla’s hands placed on its chest in a dominant stance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the toy is designed to hold an object (a stick) rather than adopt any specific aggressive or dominant stance associated with hand positioning on the chest. This toy-like design sacrifices specific posture details in favor of a whimsical, child-friendly appearance.",
    "answer": "No"
