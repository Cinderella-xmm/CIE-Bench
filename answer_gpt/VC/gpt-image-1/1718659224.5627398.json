    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the central tower of the fortress composed of multiple stacked, progressively smaller rectangular tiers forming a stepped pyramid shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central part of the cake is designed in a way that resembles a ziggurat or a stepped pyramid. This design consists of rectangular tiers stacked on top of each other, decreasing in size as they go upwards. The tiers create a staircase effect, which is characteristic of a stepped pyramid. The tiers are clearly defined and visible, showcasing a distinct progression from a broad base to a narrowed top, confirming the stepped pyramid design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there regular, alternating tooth-like projections (crenellations) along the upper edges of the fortress walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the upper edges of the fortress walls have regular, alternating protrusions typical of crenellations. These resemble the battlements seen in castles or fortresses, where the notched edges are used for defensive purposes, allowing defenders to shoot while being partially protected. The even spacing and repeated pattern of the protrusions in the cake design indicate crenellations.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a prominent arched opening located at the lower front section of the fortress, serving as a main entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the lower front section of the cake, there is an arched opening resembling an entrance or gate. This arch is prominently positioned on the fortress's facade and is large enough to suggest an entrance, similar to what might be expected as a main gate in fortress architecture.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the waterfall originate from a gap in the cliff face directly beneath the fortress wall and cascade downward into the river below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake has a white creamy element resembling a waterfall flowing from the arched opening at the base of the fortress. However, there is no representation of a cliff face or cascading down into a river below; instead, it directly flows from the fortress onto the plate, indicating that in this cake interpretation, the waterfall is stylized rather than realistic.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the fortress situated on a raised cliff overlooking a river that flows through a narrow canyon below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fortress is perched on a mound shaped from cake, clearly visible due to its elevation above the base designed to mimic terrain. However, while the design includes this elevated terrain, there is no river or canyon depicted below the fortress like in a natural landscape; instead, the cake sits on a flat plate, showing that the setting is simplified and does not display a cliff overlooking a canyon and river.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are clusters of green shrubs and trees visible along the canyon walls and riverbanks surrounding the fortress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are green elements on the cake that appear to be decorative, resembling shrubs or trees. These are placed adjacent to the fortress structure itself as part of the design, rather than alongside any riverbanks or canyon walls, since these landscape features do not exist in the cake. They are stylized additions for visual effect rather than a faithful reproduction of a natural setting.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the fortress have a solid rectangular base with vertical walls and corner towers supporting the upper levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the cake design (Image B), the base of the fortress is solid and rectangular, featuring vertical walls with crenellations and structural integrity that resemble fortified architecture. The corners are reinforced, mimicking the design of towers that provide support to the levels stacked above, thus confirming the presence of a solid rectangular base with the architectural features mentioned.",
