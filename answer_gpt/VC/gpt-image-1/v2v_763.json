      "question": "Is the number \"18\" clearly visible on the back of the player's jersey?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene shows a chibi-style cartoon character resembling a baseball player. The number \"18\" is visibly printed on the character’s purple jersey. In cartoon depictions like this, such details are often exaggerated or simplified for clarity and stylistic purposes. Therefore, it fits within the typical design structure to have numbers visible and recognizable.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the number \"18\" visible on the front left side of the player's jersey?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's number \"18\" is conspicuously placed on the left side of the front of the jersey. In cartoon styles, details like numbers can be placed prominently to fit within a small frame and maintain recognizability, which is the case here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the player wearing a purple jersey and a purple cap with a black brim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is wearing a purple jersey and a matching purple cap, consistent with a baseball uniform. The cap also features a black brim, which is a common stylistic choice in baseball caps to contrast and enhance the overall appearance.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the player's hands covered with white batting gloves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character’s depiction includes exaggerated features. The character wears white gloves, a typical detail in both realistic and stylized sports animations to imply batting without getting into realistic textural details.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the player holding a black baseball bat with both hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is shown with a black baseball bat, which is a common aesthetic choice in animated portrayals to create clear visual separation between the character and the equipment. The hands are not holding the bat with the typical both-hand grip, as often seen in chibi or playful renders; instead, the focus seems more on the dynamic pose through the portal.",
      "weight": 3,

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a white baseball with red stitching visible in the air, approaching the bat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a white baseball with red stitching is indeed shown approaching the character. This element is standard in baseball-related imagery to indicate action or the sport itself. The presence of the baseball is clear and is an important feature in sports-focused animation.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the player in a crouched batting stance with knees bent and torso twisted forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted in a playful rather than a realistic stance due to the chibi style. While the character is in motion and adopting an athletic pose, it's more about emphasizing movement and action through the portal rather than adopting a detailed, realistic crouched batting stance.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are both hands gripping the bat near the handle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, because the character is a chibi-style portrayal, the bat appears to be held in a non-traditional way due to the exaggerated nature of the representation and the dynamic scene, unlike in realistic depictions. Therefore, it doesn't show a grip near the handle with both hands traditionally.",
