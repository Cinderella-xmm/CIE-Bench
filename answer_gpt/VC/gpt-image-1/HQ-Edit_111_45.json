        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the anvil has a distinct form with a rectangular base that typically supports the structure, and a pointed horn which is commonly used in blacksmithing for shaping metal. This type of anvil facilitates various forging tasks.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a clear visual representation of a metal object resting on the anvil, glowing in red-orange hue, indicative of a forge-heated metal ready for manipulation. The glow suggests high temperature which is a characteristic of heated metals during blacksmithing.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hammer positioned above or in contact with the glowing metal on the anvil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer is depicted in the image as above or very near the glowing metal on the anvil, which suggests the ongoing process of striking and shaping the metal. This is a common action within the context of blacksmithing where control of the hammer is crucial.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual evidence from Image B indicates the presence of tongs held in the blacksmith's left hand. This tool is essential for securely handling hot metal during the forging process, ensuring safety and precision.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the anvil resting directly on the ground, without a wooden stump, which usually provides a stable base for forging activities, reducing the impact force on the floor and ease of use.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a stone furnace with fiercely glowing fires within its recessed area, indicating active use. This detail is typical of blacksmithing scenarios where sustained high heat is required for metal work.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include any additional figures near the furnace, focusing solely on one blacksmith, which suggests a solitary work environment rather than a shared space.",
