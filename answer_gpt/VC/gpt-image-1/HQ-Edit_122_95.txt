    "Question": "Q2: Are the two figures positioned symmetrically relative to the central axis of the image?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the two figures placed symmetrically on either side of the central pathway, consistent with the composition of many traditional and cultural artworks where figures are balanced around a central focal point.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is there a large central dome visible at the end of the pathway?",

}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there an arched stone entrance framing the view of the central structure?",

}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a straight water channel running from the foreground to the central structure?",
