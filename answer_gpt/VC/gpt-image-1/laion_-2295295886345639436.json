      "question": "Is the mouth wide open in a roaring expression with visible teeth and tongue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining the edited image, we observe three different characters representing different eras. Although the faces are blurred, none show a roaring expression or hint at a wide-open mouth with visible teeth and tongue. Typically, a wide-open mouth displaying teeth and tongue requires detailed facial features, which cannot be discerned in this blurred presentation. Therefore, based on visual interpretation and logical reasoning, the roaring expression is not depicted here.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the eyes narrowed and focused, indicating anger or exertion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the eyes of all characters are blurred in the depiction, making it impossible to visually determine if they are narrowed or focused. Such expressions typically require clarity to observe the details in eye shape and eyebrow positioning, which are absent now. Therefore, without visible eye details for analysis, we conclude this expression is not indicated.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the head have a balding crown with hair along the sides and back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the edited image, particularly focusing on any indication of hair pattern is challenging due to the blurring. This portrayal could signal a full head of hair typical of both masculine figures portrayed across different eras. Without a clear view of the hairstyle pattern, the attribute of a balding crown cannot be confirmed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the jawline strong and angular, with a defined chin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The characters in the edited image evoke strength, as depicted by their muscular physiques and historical representations of warriors or strongmen. However, due to the facial blurring, a direct observation of jawline and chin is not possible. For a depiction showing defined facial features, clarity is essential, which is not present here. Therefore, based on the lack of visible facial structure details, such an attribute is not discernible.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the head located at the top center of the figure, aligned with the spine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the head's positioning adheres to a typical human anatomical structure as expected in illustrations. Despite the blurring, the heads of the characters are positioned at the top center of their bodies, naturally aligned with the spine, consistent with recognizable spear and pose interpretation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the face clean-shaven, without a beard or mustache?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurred rendition of each characterâ€™s face makes the determination of facial hair impossible. From general knowledge, in historical representations, Roman soldiers might be clean-shaven, but variability exists across differing eras. Without unambiguous details and personal characteristics observable due to the blurring, this cannot be confirmed.",
