      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the image composed of two separate panels, with one bird on the left and one on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual composition does not show two distinct panels like a split screen. Instead, there are two birds placed side by side on individual pedestals within a continuous scene. The distinction between the birds is more fluid and artistic, unlike a panel division.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the bird that was originally on the left still located in the left panel, and the bird that was originally on the right still located in the right panel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features two artistic representations of birds, with one appearing to be made from a wooden material on the left and another composed of a crystalline material on the right. There is no clear connection to their original positions from Image A, making any direct location comparison irrelevant due to different artistic styling.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the bird on the left have its head turned toward the viewer, with its beak slightly open and facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird on the left is stylized as a wooden sculpture, facing slightly toward the viewer with its beak constructed to appear closed. The artistic nature of the depiction does not show a realistic bird's head position or an open beak.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bird on the right have its body angled such that its back is partially visible and it is facing left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bird on the right in Image B, depicted as a crystalline sculpture, is angled with a forward-facing position showing only its profile rather than a partial back view. The bird's stylistic composition does not match a natural angle facing left.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the feet of both birds clearly shown gripping a surface beneath them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both birds in Image B are presented as sculptures with their feet visually resting on individual pedestals. These feet appear structurally sitting on the pedestals without detailed gripping as a real bird might, due to the artistic rendering.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do both birds maintain an upright, balanced silhouette with a distinct head, body, and tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the artistic reinterpretation in Image B, both birds maintain an upright and conceptual silhouette with a recognizable head, body, and tail structure, conforming to the basic morphology of birds.",
