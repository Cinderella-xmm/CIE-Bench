      "question": "Does the realistic cat figure retain the cream-colored body with dark brown points on the ears, face, paws, and tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The realistic cat figure is designed to resemble a Siamese cat, which typically has a cream-colored body accompanied by darker points on certain areas like the ears, face, paws, and tail. Image B depicts a chibi-style cat figure sitting next to its packaging, illustrating these color characteristics. Therefore, based on this style depiction and knowledge of Siamese coloring, the realistic cat retains the cream-colored body with dark points in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the realistic cat figure have bright blue eyes with visible reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a highly stylized representation with exaggerated features typical of chibi art, including large, bright eyes with noticeable reflections, enhancing the figure's cuteness. By comparing this to Image A—a realistic cat with natural blue eyes that capture brightness and reflection—the chibi figure successfully retains this notable characteristic. Therefore, bright blue eyes with reflections are indeed present on the figure in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the tail of the realistic cat figure curled tightly around its body, forming a dark ring underneath?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the chibi cat figure with a rounded tail positioned at the base of its figure, common in such art styles to pull detail from the original, realistic image, where the cat has a tail curled around it forming a recognizable dark ring. The design smartly adapts this detail from Image A to maintain continuity with the realistic version.",

      "question": "Is the wooden windowsill present with visible horizontal planks and warm brown tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's presentation of the cat figure next to its packaging box lacks the original context provided by Image A—the windowsill with detailed horizontal planks and warm tones. The simplified art choice, typical for stylized packaging, might forgo such detailed backgrounds. Thus, the realistic wooden windowsill isn't explicitly depicted alongside the chibi figure.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the small ceramic vase with blue floral pattern and pinkish-purple spherical flowers present on the windowsill?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vase is present in Image A, contributing to the environment by adding detail with its floral pattern and pinkish-purple flowers. Image B incorporates a simplified version on the box artwork, maintaining thematic consistency even if less detail than the realistic setting. However, the chibi figure itself doesn't directly interact with these elements separately from the box design.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the realistic cat figure display smooth, softly shaded fur with natural gradients and texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The realistic cat figure in Image A captures a lifelike texture and gradient nuances essential to such design, playing into realism. However, the transition to Image B's chibi form prioritizes simplified shading and smoothness for stylization over realism, reducing fur texturing. Thus, the highly detailed fur isn't mirrored in Image B's figure form.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the window frame and outdoor landscape (trees, hills, overcast sky) visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A showcases the context with a window frame offering hints of a serene outdoor scene. However, Image B chooses an artistic direction with box illustration, embedding a stylized version of these elements instead of literal background scenery. The ambiance is preserved metaphorically rather than visually represented around the chibi figure.",
