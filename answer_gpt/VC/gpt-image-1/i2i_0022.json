      "question": "Is the cat depicted in a curled-up position with one paw visibly stretched out?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is depicted in an illustrated form and appears to be in a curled-up position. However, it is important to note that no paw is visibly stretched out. Instead, the paws are tucked under or close to the body, which aligns with the common visual style of a curled-up feline in illustrations. The lack of a stretched-out paw is a critical observation for answering this question.",

      "question": "Is the cat shown lying on a curved surface representing the car's hood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is depicted lying on a light brown curved surface, which seems simplified and abstract. This surface could be interpreted as a pillow or mound, rather than a detailed or explicit representation of a car's hood. The illustration style suggests a generalized curved platform rather than a specific shape like a car's hood.",

      "question": "Are there reflection lines present on the curved surface under the cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stylized illustration of a cat on a curved surface, where two light reflection lines are present on the surface beneath the cat. These lines are typically used in illustrations to mimic reflective properties, suggesting shine or gloss, even though the overall surface is not a detailed representation of a real object like a car's hood.",

      "question": "Is the entire sticker image surrounded by a thick white outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an illustration that includes a distinct thick white outline surrounding the entire sticker image. This outline is a common stylistic choice for stickers, providing a border that separates the illustrated content from its background and enhances visibility.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the sticker have a transparent background behind the outlined image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sticker design is set on a transparent background, which is indicated by the checkerboard pattern surrounding the illustrated content. This pattern is widely recognized as representing transparency in digital image editing, which ensures that when the sticker is applied, only the outlined image is visible without any additional colored background.",
