    "Question": "Q1: Is the angular, multi-tiered headdress with symmetrical side flaps present and unchanged in shape and position?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is an angular, multi-tiered structure that resembles a headdress. This structure has symmetrical side flaps that are prominently lit with neon colors. The angular design is consistent with what might be considered a headdress. World knowledge of architectural and design elements helps contextualize this structure as part of a stylized, futuristic object rather than a headdress in the traditional sense. Therefore, it is unchanged in shape and position.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the eyes glowing amber in color and positioned symmetrically within the face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the face area is blurred, but neon lights suggest a symmetrical arrangement, possibly representing eyes in a stylized manner. Therefore, specific details like glowing amber color cannot be determined.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the stepped stone pedestal base present with distinct horizontal layers forming a pyramidal shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the structure appears to be made of digital or neon lights, and does not show the distinct stone or horizontal layered pyramid shape seen in a traditional pedestal. The appearance is more consistent with a futuristic design.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the segmented mechanical joints visible along the neck, beneath a translucent casing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no clear visible section that suggests mechanical joints or a neck with a translucent casing. The design is more abstract and futuristic with neon light patterns without visible mechanical details.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the head oriented directly forward, facing the viewer without rotation or tilt?",
    "explanation": "The orientation of the main structure in Image B is facing forward towards the viewer, suggested by the symmetry of the neon elements. There is no indication of rotation or tilt.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the face symmetrically structured with aligned nose, lips, and jawline?",
    "explanation": "Since the face area in Image B is blurred, specific facial features such as nose, lips, and jawline cannot be identified. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed if these features are symmetrically structured.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the head positioned directly atop the stepped pedestal, supported by it without floating or being detached?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the head-like structure and the base don't form a distinct stepped pedestal as seen in traditional structures. Instead, the design includes interconnected elements that imply a futuristic base rather than a clear, stepped pedestal.",
    "answer": "No"
