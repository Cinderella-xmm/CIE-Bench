    "Question": "Q1: Is the surfboard depicted with an elongated oval shape and a central stringer running along its length?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction inside the snow globe reflects a miniature representation of a surfer scene, including a surfboard. However, as per the visual cues and typical design constraints of such representations inside a snow globe, the surfboard doesn't show detailed realistic features like a central stringer. The focus is more on creating an aesthetically rounded representation rather than precise technical details. Hence, based on the visual depiction, the surfboard within the globe does not match the realistic elongated oval shape or the precise stringer feature.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a small white wax block being held by the right hand and applied to the surface of the surfboard?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scene depicted inside the snow globe is more stylized and simplified, focusing on capturing the essence of the original image in a chibi or caricature form. While Image A features a real-life depiction of someone waxing a surfboard, Image B does not emphasize small details such as a white wax block being held by the hand. The focus is more on the general activity of the figure than the specific objects being used.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the right hand positioned so that the fingers are gripping the wax block and making direct contact with the surfboard’s surface?",
    "explanation": "Despite Image B's figure maintaining a general hand positioning that simulates the waxing action, it does not illustrate direct interaction with a wax block contacting the surfboard surface as Image A does. The figurative representation is abstracted and simplified, lacking the detailed element of grip and contact in the original scene.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the left hand placed flat on the surfboard, parallel to the board’s surface, providing support?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the representation of the figure does not emphasize anatomical accuracy or practical support posture like in Image A. The left hand is not illustrated in a manner that depicts laying flat on the surfboard for support. Instead, the positioning is more a generalization of engaging in a surfing-related scene.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the surfboard’s surface show a granular, textured pattern consistent with wax application?",
    "explanation": "While Image A shows a granular surface characteristic of wax application due to its real-life setting, Image B, being a cartoonish replica inside a snow globe, doesn't focus on such surface details. The miniature representation within the snow globe prioritizes a clean, smooth visual portrayal over realistic textural granularity.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the figure positioned in a crouched, forward-leaning posture with knees bent and upper body angled over the surfboard?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the figure in a simple crouched position, suggesting a posture similar to crouching over a surfboard. Despite its stylized nature, the figure appears to mimic the forward-leaning posture reasonably, aligning with the visual cues from Image A but in a simplified form.",
    "answer": "Yes"
