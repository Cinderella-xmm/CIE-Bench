    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the Elizabeth Tower positioned on the right side of the image with a tall, vertical structure topped by a pointed spire and a clock face near the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a large structure resembling the Elizabeth Tower, but it has been creatively transformed into a robot-like figure with a clock face on its head. While the structure has a similar shape to the Elizabeth Tower, it's not just a tower—it's depicted as the head of a giant robot. This transformation deviates from its usual architectural design. Therefore, the structure does not fit the traditional description of the Elizabeth Tower in its natural architectural form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the building complex on the left side of the image have multiple pointed Gothic spires and a long horizontal facade with repeating arched windows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a structure with multiple pointed Gothic spires on the left side, and although the architectural details are stylized and more dramatic, they do resemble the characteristics of the Palace of Westminster due to the style and structure distribution with pointed spires. The differences are due to artistic interpretation, but the Gothic architectural style is suggested.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a red double-decker bus labeled with route number 53 traveling across the bridge from left to right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red double-decker buses are depicted as floating vehicles with a futuristic look elevated above the ground. There are no visible route numbers like '53' on them nor are they shown traveling across a traditional bridge. Instead, they are suspended in the air, contributing to a sci-fi aesthetic.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a bridge with green metal railings and a paved roadway extending across the image from left to right, connecting the buildings to the right side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a traditional bridge is absent. The ground level as seen in typical images with roads or bridges doesn't exist because the scene is reimagined with an elevated view and futuristic elements where traditional bridge components aren't illustrated. Instead, the background is more focused on imaginative elements rather than realistic geographical connections.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the text “BUS LANE” clearly visible in white lettering on the road surface near the right edge of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature any road surfaces similar to the ones in typical urban settings, where markings such as 'BUS LANE' would be visible. The depiction is more fantastical, omitting realistic road elements in favor of otherworldly elements and elevated or floating vehicles.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there people visible walking on the sidewalk on the right side of the bridge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, people are not depicted. The focus is on exaggerated structures and vehicles within a sci-fi context. Traditional elements, such as sidewalks and pedestrians, are absent from this imaginative reinterpretation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not have visible route numbers like '43' on the depicted vehicles. The red double-decker buses are floating in the sky, and no specific route details akin to what would be seen on a regular street are indicated.",
