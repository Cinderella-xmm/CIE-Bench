      "question": "Is the classical archway with ornate carvings present and maintaining its original shape and position in the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a noticeable presence of an archway, but its design resembles a stylized, cartoonish form rather than classical. While the archway maintains the general position seen in Image A, the ornate carvings have been altered to a more simplistic, playful design. In Image A, the archway has classical features with intricate carvings. Therefore, the archway in Image B does not maintain its original shape or detailed design.",

      "question": "Is the Corinthian column capital with acanthus leaf detailing visible and correctly positioned beneath the spherical perch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the column capital visible under the spherical perch has a cartoonish design rather than the detailed Corinthian style found in Image A. Image A shows a Corinthian column with distinct acanthus leaf detailing. In Image B, the design is simplified and lacking such details, making it not accurately positioned as a Corinthian column capital.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the perch located directly on top of the Corinthian column capital, maintaining its original vertical alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the perch, a spherical ornamental design, rests on top of the Corinthian column capital with detailed acanthus leaf patterns. Image B changes the style to a cartoonish bird resting on a simpler perch. While the perch is positioned relative to the column capital, it does not maintain the design or alignment seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Are the tall fluted column on the left and the distant spired buildings visible in their original positions and silhouettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a simplified, stylized version of tall, fluted columns and distant buildings. The positions appear similar to those in Image A, but the complex silhouettes and detailed architectural features have been altered in favor of a simplified, cartoon-like style. Therefore, these elements do not wholly retain their original shapes or detailed silhouettes.",

      "question": "Is the sky depicted as bright blue with scattered white cumulus clouds, matching the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is illustrated with prominent cumulus clouds but set against a warm, sepia tone instead of the bright blue depicted in Image A. Image A includes a realistic bright blue sky with scattered clouds, whereas Image B changes the atmosphere by altering the sky's color to fit a cartoon landscape, thus not matching the original.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the arch and column frame with a stylized, simplified carving design. Image A features intricate floral and scroll carvings, common in classical architecture. Image B's depiction does not maintain these details, opting instead for a playful, less detailed aesthetic.",

      "question": "Is the pigeon oriented sideways with its head turned slightly toward the viewer, maintaining its original posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is represented metaphorically as a cartoon version rather than a realistic pigeon seen in Image A. This cartoon bird is oriented in a forward-facing position with an exaggerated, friendly appearance, diverging from the sideways posture and orientation of the pigeon in Image A.",
