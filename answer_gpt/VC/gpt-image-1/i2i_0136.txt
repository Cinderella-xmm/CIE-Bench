{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the keychain maintain a proportional size and shape relative to the plate it rests on?",
    "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A, Image B shows the keychain alone on a flat surface, which doesn't provide the context of a plate for proportional comparison. Therefore, without an appropriate reference, the size and shape relative to a plate cannot be determined in the edited image.",
    "answer": "No"
