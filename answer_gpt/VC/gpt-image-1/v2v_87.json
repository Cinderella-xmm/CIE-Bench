      "question": "Does the elephant in the edited image retain large, fan-shaped ears that extend outward from the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'elephant' is a LEGO representation, which has generalized and simplified features. The ears are not large, fan-shaped as seen in real African elephants but rather simple, small, and block-like due to the LEGO design. This is a typical design choice in LEGO figures to simplify shapes, which deviates from the realistic depiction of large ears in elephants.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the elephant’s tusks long, curved, and off-white in color, extending downward from the upper jaw?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elephant in Image B, constructed from LEGO, features tusks that are simplified and not as long or curved as in real life. They are also consistent with the tan coloring of the rest of the model rather than the off-white typically associated with real elephant tusks. This simplification is characteristic of LEGO design aimed at visual clarity while maintaining structural integrity.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the elephant’s skin depicted with deep wrinkles and folds, particularly on the trunk, legs, and ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO elephant's skin is smooth and lacks deep wrinkles or folds, as the LEGO design focuses on essential forms without intricate details due to the nature of the blocks. Realistic texturing like wrinkles is not a typical characteristic of LEGO models, which are designed to maintain simplicity and uniformity.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the elephant’s feet show five distinct toes on each foot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO elephant in Image B has feet that do not show individual toes. Instead, they are represented by the simple, block-like feet typical of LEGO design. This lack of detail is in line with the LEGO figurine style, which abstracts complex features into basic shapes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the backpack rendered in a rich, saturated red color matching the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no separate backpack in Image B, as the elephant is a LEGO model in a display box and includes only block representations without additional accessories like a backpack. The red element present is part of the elephant's saddle or similar structure, rather than a separate backpack, so comparing colors is not applicable.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the backpack present as a separate object positioned near the elephant in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setup is a LEGO display box featuring the elephant model and a human figure but no separate backpack placed near the elephant like in Image A. The entire focus is on presenting the models within a contained environment rather than as separate objects.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the animal clearly identifiable as an African elephant based on its ear size, tusk shape, and overall body structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The animal in Image B is a simplified LEGO representation that lacks the distinctive large, fan-shaped ears and specific body proportions characteristic of an African elephant. The overall simplification and abstraction inherent to LEGO designs mean that these specific features do not genuinely represent an African elephant.",
