      "question": "Is the transparent tank section of the vape device clearly visible, allowing the internal liquid to be seen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transparent tank section of the vape device is depicted clearly with annotations that help identify the internal liquid level. The illustration and labeling within the comic outlines the visible approach to comprehending the presence of liquid within the tank, making it apparent and measurable.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the black mouthpiece and cap at the top of the vape device present and correctly positioned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration in Image B features the vape device with a black mouthpiece and cap prominently placed at the top of the device. The presence and positioning are clear and consistent with what is commonly expected with vape devices.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the coil component located at the base of the device, visible through the transparent tank?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the coil component in the upper section of the device rather than at the base, which is opposite to common vape construction where coils are typically near the tank section, this makes the coil not visually apparent at the device base.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The liquid is illustrated inside the tank with a marked presence shown on Image B. The visual representation, coupled with labeling, makes the liquid visibly occupy a notable section of the device’s transparent tank.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly outlines a logical vertical arrangement of components, where the coil, liquid, and battery are sequentially organized from top to bottom, indicated by both the visual layout and annotation within the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B has drawings reflecting internal components, there isn’t a clear indication or depiction of airflow pathways or inlets. Thus, Image B does not visually or textually imply any airflow pathways at the device base.",
