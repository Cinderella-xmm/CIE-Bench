      "question": "Is the tabletop still circular in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the tabletop is no longer circular; instead, it has a gear-like shape with multiple edges resembling gear teeth. The analysis process involves recognizing the distinct geometric shape that departs from the uniformity of a circle. A comparison with Image A reveals that the original tabletop is indeed circular, with a smooth edge. World knowledge about shapes and geometry helps in distinguishing the altered form in the edited image.",

      "question": "Does a single vertical column extend from the center of the tabletop to the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of a single vertical column, there is a complex mechanical structure composed of multiple components and extensions. The analysis recognizes that there are multiple cylindrical parts involved in supporting the tabletop, unlike the straightforward column in Image A. Understanding mechanical assembly and engineering concepts aids in identifying the differences between the structures.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the base consist of five symmetrically arranged legs forming a star shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B indicates the base does not form a star shape with symmetrically arranged legs. The legs are more akin to spider-like appendages with intricacy and pivot joints, unlike Image A's simple and symmetrical star-leg arrangement. Using knowledge of mechanics and symmetry helps identify and contrast the complex arrangement in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there small black rubber feet at the tip of each leg?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By analyzing Image B, the tips of the legs show metallic extensions without any black rubber feet, contrary to what is depicted in Image A where black rubber feet are clearly visible. The reasoning involves recognizing the material and finish at the connection points in both images, leveraging knowledge about furniture design and assembly parts.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the height of the central column approximately equal to the diameter of the tabletop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For Image B, the complex base and tabletop arrangement make it difficult to discern the proportional relationship of height to diameter directly. Visual inspection suggests that the column-like structure is not central nor vertically oriented as it was in Image A, which had clear proportional cues. Understanding spatial dimensions and basic proportioning helps conclude that the designs differ significantly.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the main body of the table still made of a shiny, silver-colored metal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the table with a textured, bronze-like appearance, rich in detail and ornamentation, unlike the shiny silver finish of Image A. Analysis involves assessing the color and texture shift, supported by knowledge of metal types and finishes used in different aesthetic designs.",
