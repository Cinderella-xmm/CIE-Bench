    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the bear's body shaped with a distinct hump over the shoulders and a broad, muscular back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear stands upright near the chalkboard, and its posture indicates that its back is broad and muscular. Though the torso is visible, the presence of a shoulder hump is less clear due to the angle and the blurred face region.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the salmon have a clearly defined forked tail fin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The salmon in Image B is depicted in the life cycle diagram, where multiple stages are illustrated. The part labeled 'adult' shows a salmon with a clearly defined forked tail fin, indicating recognition of the common tail design of salmon.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the bear’s fur rendered with visible texture and layered shading, showing wetness and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear is brown with visible fur texture. The shading illustrates a structured, yet dry texture lacking the depth and wetness seen in natural or realistic representations. The image appears more illustrative than textured in depth.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the salmon colored with a blue-green back and a silvery-white belly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the life cycle diagram is illustrative, depicting the salmon in various stages. The 'adult' stage shows a salmon colored with a blue-green back and silvery-white belly, consistent with natural colorations of salmon.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible water splashes or ripples around the bear’s lower legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of water or splashes around the bear as it stands near a chalkboard. The setting is educational rather than natural where water would be expected.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the bear have a long, broad snout with visible nostrils and a rounded muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a bear illustration with some elements of features like a muzzle but lacks definitive detail to confirm the presence of broad snout or visible nostrils due to blur. An illustrative bear more often lacks detail compared to realistic depictions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the salmon positioned horizontally in the bear’s mouth, with its head protruding forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear does not hold a salmon in its mouth as is seen in the surrounding diagram providing an educational overview. There is no salmon visible directly with the bear.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
