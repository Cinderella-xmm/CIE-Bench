      "question": "Is the capybara’s fur visibly brown with detailed texture and fine hair strands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fur of the capybara is illustrated in a stylized manner typical of a drawing or graphic design. The fur is not shown with the realistic detail and texture as depicted in a photograph; instead, it has a smooth and uniform brown color without the visibility of individual hair strands or detailed texture. This is consistent with the artistic style of the image.",

      "question": "Are the white, shell-shaped roofs of the Sydney Opera House clearly visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Sydney Opera House is depicted in the background with its iconic white, shell-shaped roofs. However, this representation is in line with an artistic illustration, which may slightly alter or simplify details compared to a photo. The shape is recognizable, making it clear that these are meant to symbolize the Opera House.",

      "question": "Is the capybara wearing a blue knitted beanie with visible ribbed texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara is depicted wearing a blue beanie, and while it is stylized in a way that suggests knitting with the indents and outlines of a knit pattern, the texture and detail are simplified as part of the illustration style. The artistic representation implies a knitted texture through the outline but doesn't provide the detailed ribbed texture a close-up photo would.",

      "question": "Is the capybara’s right paw visibly gripping the glass containing the orange-red beverage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara is holding a glass with an orange-red beverage, but due to the stylized and illustrative nature, the specifics of paw gripping action, such as movement or fur details, are not depicted with realistic clarity. However, an understanding of common depiction in cartoons suggests that the right paw is meant to be holding the glass.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the black sunglasses worn by the capybara displaying the word “SPY” on the temple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the capybara is wearing sunglasses, the illustrative style does not show detailed inscriptions or logos like “SPY” on them. Brand details are generally minimized or omitted in artistic representations of characters to focus on the overall aesthetic rather than specifics of brand.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara wears a visually distinct blue sleeveless sweater without discernible stripes or different colors, making it a departure from expectations based on the description. The style is consistent with the creative illustration where clothing details are usually depicted in a simplistic or particular manner emphasizing color and shape rather than texture or pattern.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration of the beverage includes both a blue straw and what appears to be a stylized orange slice garnish. The vibrant color contrasts help indicate these details, typical of illustrations that use bold colors to accentuate elements.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara is indeed shown in a side profile view facing left, with the head turned slightly toward the viewer. This depiction is common in illustrative styles to maintain engagement with the viewer while simultaneously showing the subject's profile.",
