      "question": "Is the radial floral and scrollwork pattern with symmetrical swirls and leaf-like motifs present around the central area of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottle in Image B has intricate decorative patterns covering its surface. The pattern exhibits features such as symmetrical swirls and leaf-like motifs, which are typical of floral scrollwork designs. Observing the placement around the clock face in the center suggests it is indeed radial in nature, spreading from this central point and creating a harmonious design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the Roman numerals I through XII arranged in a circular sequence around the central label or design element?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examining the area labeled 'TIMELESS RESERVE,' there is a set of Roman numerals I through VI clearly visible below the label. The numerals in Image B do form a part of a circular sequence suggesting a clock-like design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the decorative patterns exhibit clear embossed relief with visible depth and shadowing, indicating raised surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show depth and shadowing particularly around the ornate patterns. Common sense suggests embossed designs usually have such characteristics that produce light and dark contrasts due to raised surfaces. The intricate decoration on the bottle indicates it has depth and is likely embossed.",

      "question_id": "Q4",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a bottle with a prominent circular element labeled 'TIMELESS RESERVE' at its center. This central element is the focal point of the design, and its position suggests geometric centrality, commonly seen in objects mimicking clock faces.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the ornate design on Image B, while there are detailed embossings and scrollwork present, especially notable at junctions and curls, the specific inclusion of small decorative dots and intricate filigree details is not prominently visible.",
