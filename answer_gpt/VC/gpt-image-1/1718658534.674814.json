      "question": "Is the dorsal ridge composed of a series of raised, looped structures running along the back of the pig?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dorsal ridge appears as a smooth, continuous raised feature that resembles stylized scallops rather than distinct looped structures. The object appears to be a ceramic or similar material, which would likely not feature looped fabric-like structures. In contrast, Image A shows a knitted fabric pig with a dorsal ridge consisting of distinct looped yarns. Based on these observations, the ridge on Image B does not have raised, looped structures.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the tail extend from the rear of the pig and terminate in a fluffy pom-pom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tail extends from the rear and forms a knot with a tassel that resembles a pom-pom, similar to stylized representations on crafted objects like ceramics. Although it is not fluffy in a textile sense like Image A, it does have the visual and structural characteristics of a small pom-pom-like tassel. Therefore, the representation fits the given description.",

      "question": "Are there four short legs attached beneath the body, two on each side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig figure has four short and stout legs positioned underneath the body with one pair on each side, which matches the description of being attached beneath the body. This is consistent with common depictions of pig statues and toys. Similarly, Image A also depicts four short legs, but in a knitted form. Both images conform to the described configuration.",

      "question": "Is there a rounded snout extending forward from the face of the pig?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B visually represents a pig with a prominently rounded snout protruding from its face, typical of ceramic pig figures which often feature simplified, exaggerated features. Although the snout doesn't have detailed textures or patterns seen in Image A's knitted version, the fundamental shape and extension are present in both images.",

    {

      "question": "Are there two small, upright ears positioned on the top of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig's head features two small ears positioned symmetrically at the top, which aligns with common designs for pig imagery in sculptures, toys, and art. Despite the difference in materials, the placement and style are similar to those in Image A (where knitted ears are placed similarly), confirming the continued presence of this characteristic.",
