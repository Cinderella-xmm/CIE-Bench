    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the capybara’s snout shape — including the rounded nose, wide mouth, and visible teeth — preserved in the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the face is blurred, we can infer that features like the snout shape would likely be consistent with the typical characteristics of a capybara, considering a bust normally retains key animal features. In Image A, the capybara displays a rounded nose and wide mouth which are common features. Given that other details like the shoulder straps and sweater are retained in the bronze sculpture, the snout is likely kept as well.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the white muzzle area, positioned centrally on the face and extending from the nose to the upper lip, preserved in the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, being a bronze sculpture, would reproduce key features like the white muzzle area mainly through texture rather than color. Since the sculpture retains the animalistic shape and detailing, the prominent central muzzle feature extending downwards would be part of this representation, albeit in a monochrome bronze finish.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the whiskers present and arranged in the same radial pattern from the snout as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The whiskers in Image B are distinctly observed sticking out from the sides, similar to real animal whiskers and matching the configuration seen in Image A. Sculpture details commonly include elements like whiskers for added realism, so the radial pattern is likely preserved.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the glasses positioned directly over the eyes, with the frame aligned horizontally across the bridge of the nose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the blurred face, we can observe glasses on the sculpture where they would naturally align across the bridge of the nose and rest over the eyes. In Image A, the glasses have this typical positioning. Given that sculptures often mimic the alignment and positioning of items, the glasses would be consistent with this setup.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sweater and shoulder straps positioned on the shoulders and torso in the same way as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bronze sculpture depicts the sweater and shoulder straps as seen wrapping around the shoulders. Since these items are integral features and normally crafted to maintain the original garment structure, they would remain similar to their positioning in Image A, where they cover the shoulders and frame the torso.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the capybara’s head shape — rounded, broad, and proportionally large relative to the body — preserved in the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Sculptures typically retain the basic anatomical proportions of the subject. In Image B, the bust has a rounded and broad head shape relative to the body, similar to Image A, which shows a characteristic capybara head that would naturally be represented in such a sculpture.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the mouth depicted as slightly open, revealing the teeth, in the same manner as the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not clearly show an open mouth due to the blur, but sculptures usually adhere to defining features like facial expressions. In Image A, the capybara has an open mouth showing teeth. Typically, a bust would maintain such expressions for authenticity, so the slightly open mouth is likely represented.",
