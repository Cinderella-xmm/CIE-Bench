    "Question": "Q1: Is the transparent tank section of the vape device clearly visible, allowing the internal liquid to be seen?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the transparent tank section of the vape device is depicted clearly with annotations that help identify the internal liquid level. The illustration and labeling within the comic outlines the visible approach to comprehending the presence of liquid within the tank, making it apparent and measurable.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is the coil component located at the base of the device, visible through the transparent tank?",
    "explanation": "Image B illustrates the coil component in the upper section of the device rather than at the base, which is opposite to common vape construction where coils are typically near the tank section, this makes the coil not visually apparent at the device base.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the liquid inside the transparent tank clearly visible and present at a measurable level?",
    "explanation": "The liquid is illustrated inside the tank with a marked presence shown on Image B. The visual representation, coupled with labeling, makes the liquid visibly occupy a notable section of the device’s transparent tank.",

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the internal components (coil, liquid, battery) arranged in a logically consistent vertical alignment within the device?",
    "explanation": "Image B clearly outlines a logical vertical arrangement of components, where the coil, liquid, and battery are sequentially organized from top to bottom, indicated by both the visual layout and annotation within the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is an airflow pathway indicated or implied in the device’s structure, such as an inlet near the base?",
