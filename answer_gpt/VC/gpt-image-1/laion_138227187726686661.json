      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quilt features colored squares with circular designs that resemble construction toy pieces or bricks, not sports balls like footballs. Based on the visual cues, no red football with white laces is present in Image B's quilt design. Image A shows a quilt with various sports balls, including a football with white laces. Comparing both images, Image B lacks the sport-themed design of Image A.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B’s quilt design incorporates colored squares and circles resembling toys or bricks, not sports balls like soccer balls. Upon examining the visual cues, no soccer balls with hexagonal patterns are present in Image B's quilt design. In contrast, Image A includes a soccer ball with hexagons. The direct comparison reveals that Image B does not contain the sport-themed elements found in the quilt of Image A.",

      "explanation": "Image B features a quilt design with colored squares and circles resembling toy elements, not sports balls like basketballs. Visual inspection shows no presence of orange basketballs with black lines within Image B. Image A includes an orange basketball with black lines.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a quilt designed around geometrically simple shapes, like squares and circles, without sports ball motifs such as baseballs. Given the visual clues, no white baseball with red stitching is found in Image B’s quilt. Image A features such a baseball design. Comparing both images highlights that Image B does not carry the sport-themed designs of Image A.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a quilt designed with a grid of colored squares arranged in a patchwork manner. Visual inspection reveals a coherent design pattern that features a variety of colors assembled in a structured rectangular arrangement. Thus, Image B is defined by this grid and patchwork pattern. Image A also features a similar grid pattern but with sports-themed motifs. Both images display patchwork design, confirming Image B's use of such a pattern.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B consists of a toy-inspired quilt design with colorful geometric shapes, devoid of sports balls or star patterns. Visual analysis confirms the absence of blue and white stars or sports ball motifs. Image A, conversely, includes blue and white stars interspersed between sports balls. Comparing the images, Image B lacks the star-themed embellishments found in Image A.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a colorful and abstract quilt design that does not include sports balls, thus there is no basis for comparing their relative positions with Image A's sports ball-themed quilt. Image A contains both sports balls and specific locations for them in the design. Thus, Image B cannot maintain any relative locations for sports balls as it lacks these motifs entirely.",
