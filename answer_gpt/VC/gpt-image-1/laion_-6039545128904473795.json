    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there exactly four rotor assemblies arranged symmetrically around the central body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drone does have four rotor assemblies which are positioned symmetrically around its central body. This is determined by observing that the propellers are situated at each corner, which complementarily balances the structure, a common design for drones to achieve stable flight.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there yellow triangular markings present on the top and side surfaces of the central body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a cartoonish depiction of a drone and does not show yellow triangular markings on the top or side surfaces of the central body. Instead, it displays an angular, robotic face design with glowing yellow features, differing from any utilitarian yellow markings.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the landing supports shaped like V-forms at each corner of the drone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drone's supports appear to be stylized claws rather than V-shaped landing supports. The visual style reflects a fictional design focused on an aggressive appearance rather than practical landing gear design typical in real drones.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the central body feature sharp, angular edges and a polygonal structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central body of the drone in Image B is depicted with sharp, angular edges and a polygonal structure, highlighted by its aggressive and robotic aesthetic. This design choice matches the stylized look of a futuristic or fictional machine.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there three small rectangular lights aligned horizontally on the top surface of the central body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the central body with a panel that resembles two glowing eyes but not three horizontal rectangular lights. This design leans more towards a fictional representation rather than the practical lighting typically found on drones.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the drone predominantly black with yellow accent markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drone appears to be predominantly black with some yellow features like the lights, not accent markings. These emphasized areas contribute to the animated effect, representing features such as eyes and a mouth rather than decorative markings.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
