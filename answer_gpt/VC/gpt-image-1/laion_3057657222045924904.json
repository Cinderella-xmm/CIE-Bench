      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the headlights of the car are observed. The narrow, trapezoidal shape with sharp edges is characteristic of modern sports cars and provides a distinctive and aggressive look. The observed headlights conform to this description, thus this characteristic is present.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels are black and multi-spoke, allowing visibility of the brake calipers. Red is a common color for performance brake calipers as it is often associated with speed and sportiness. Upon inspection, red brake calipers are indeed visible behind the wheels in this image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Air intake vents are critical for cooling in performance cars, often styled in a contrasting color like black for emphasis. In Image B, an angular side air intake vent can be seen running along the door line, consistent with design aesthetics and functional needs of such cars.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car's design is analyzed. A dihedral door line is characteristic of certain sportscar models, where it plays into the aerodynamic and aesthetic aspects of the vehicle. While the exact dihedral action is not visible, the design hints at the possibility with lines extending from the front to the rear.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Mid-engine cars often feature a balanced design with a certain proportion, but typically have shorter front hoods due to engine placement. In Image B, the carâ€™s proportions are athletic and compact with an emphasis on a rear design that indicates mid-engine placement, contrary to a long hood seen in front-engine models.",
