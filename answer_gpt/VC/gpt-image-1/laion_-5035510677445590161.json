    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the long, curly, voluminous white beard present and extending down the front of the chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on visual cues, the beard in Image B is similar to traditional representations of a long, curly, voluminous beard, commonly associated with figures like Santa Claus. Observing the edited image shows the beard extending down the chest area, indicating its length and volume.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the thin-rimmed glasses worn on the face, positioned over the eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visual analysis of Image B reveals no presence of thin-rimmed glasses over the eyes. The face area does not display any eyewear typical of reading glasses or spectacles.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the right arm extended outward with the palm facing upward and fingers slightly spread?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right arm is indeed extended outward, but the positioning shows the palm facing downward, not upward. The fingers appear to be slightly spread in an outward manner.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the mouth curved upward in a smile and the eyes slightly crinkled at the corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since the face area is blurred, it is not possible to analyze the presence of a smile or the crinkled appearance of the eyes. Thus, the distinctive expressions typically associated with smiling cannot be confirmed.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the head turned slightly to the left side of the frame, facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall stance and positioning of the body in Image B suggest the head may have a slight turn to the left, yet is primarily oriented to face forward. This is discernible despite the blurred sections impacting specific directional interpretation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the facial features including the nose, eyebrows, and cheeks clearly visible and consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "As the facial area is blurred in Image B, it prevents clear identification and comparison with facial features like the nose, eyebrows, and cheeks from Image A. Thus, consistency cannot be confirmed.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the fingers of the right hand splayed outward with natural spacing between them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visual observation of the right hand in Image B reveals that the fingers are indeed splayed outward, with visible natural spacing between them, confirming the gesture as described.",
