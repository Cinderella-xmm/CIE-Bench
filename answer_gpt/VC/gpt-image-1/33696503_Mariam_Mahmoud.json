      "question": "Is the orange circular lifebuoy still present and clearly visible in the same position near the netting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible orange circular lifebuoy in the scene. Instead, the edited image features an artistic portrayal of a creature that blends into the shoreline and water, lacking human-made objects seen in Image A. The presence of this illustration suggests that any lifebuoy that might have been present originally is no longer visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dark mesh netting still visible along the shoreline, connected by vertical poles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible dark mesh netting along the shoreline. The edited image predominantly shows an artistic creature with a sandy texture and fins without any indication of man-made structures like netting or poles. Therefore, the netting seen originally seems to have been replaced with artistic elements in the edited scene.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the shoreline maintain its original diagonal slope from the bottom left to the top right of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a fantastical creature along the waterline which alters the appearance of the shoreline. The creature integrates into the shore, changing the slope visually compared to Image A. Hence, the direction and shape of the slope are no longer clearly maintained in the same way due to the creatureâ€™s artistic influence.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the orange lifebuoy physically connected to one of the vertical poles of the netting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "As analyzed earlier, Image B does not depict an orange lifebuoy or vertical poles with netting. Instead, it presents an artistic illustration which does not include any such life-saving equipment, suggesting their removal or replacement in the edited version.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible white foam patterns in the water immediately adjacent to the shoreline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the focus is on the artistic rendering, the water near the creature shows some foam-like patterns, indicating movement similar to foam patterns typically seen in water near shorelines. Thus, the artistic portrayal has managed to subtly integrate such elements in the visual.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the sand along the shoreline still light beige in color, without significant discoloration or tinting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area where sand would typically be observed does not look like natural sand due to an artistic overlay. The creature and its textural portrayal modify and likely tint the sand from its original appearance as seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are at least three vertical poles visible along the netting, evenly spaced from the foreground to the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The artistic render in Image B has excluded all structural elements such as poles or netting resulting in a different visual focus. There are no vertical poles visible as per the original image setup.",
