      "question": "Is the bird's eye clearly visible with a dark blue iris, black pupil, and a thin white orbital ring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's eye is prominent with a large, clear dark blue iris and a black pupil. There is a white portion around the eye, which helps define its edge. This is visually distinct and matches the description. World knowledge of avian eye anatomy suggests that these features indicate a typical stylization used in artwork to make animal eyes look expressive and engaging.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the bird have a short, conical beak that is pale pinkish-gray with a dark tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird has a short, conical beak typical of a sparrow character, but it appears distinctly brown with possible stylization for artistic emphasis. This differs from the description of a pale pinkish-gray color. Artistic depictions often exaggerate or alter colors to fit a theme.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the bird’s feathers visibly fluffy and layered, with warm earthy tones including tan, brown, and reddish crown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's feathers do appear fluffy and layered, with warm earthy tones like tan and brown. However, the reddish crown is more of a warm brown hue, not a distinct reddish color. Artistic preference might have influenced these choices, invoking a whimsical feel synonymous with storybook illustrations.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bird’s tail feathers extend downward in a long, narrow, layered shape with natural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tail feathers of the bird are not depicted in a long and narrow form. They appear more tucked and cartoon-like, matching the chibi style. Natural shading and long narrow shapes are features more aligned with realistic depictions rather than colorful and expressive artwork.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the bird’s feet visible with claws gripping the branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bird in Image B is sitting on a branch, and its feet are stylized but visible, showing claws that are clearly gripping the branch. In many artistic portrayals, animals are depicted simplistically yet effectively to maintain focus on the subject, consistent with world knowledge of illustrations in children's books.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the bird positioned upright on the branch, facing slightly to the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is positioned upright on the branch with its body orientation suggesting it is facing slightly to the left. Such positioning is common in animated and illustrated contexts, meant to convey attention in a particular direction, enhancing narrative flow through visual storytelling.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there green moss visible on the right side of the branch beneath the bird?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the branch does not show any green moss on the right side beneath the bird, unlike naturalistic depictions that might include detailed background elements. This indicates a focus on a clear and neat presentation in alignment with the thematic style of a children's narrative.",
