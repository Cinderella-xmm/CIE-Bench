      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cover illustration features a stylized depiction of a snowboarder with a snowboard clearly illustrated beneath the feet of the character. It is especially emphasized given the artwork's emphasis on a snowboarding theme, emphasized by the title 'SNOWBOARD ADVENTURE.'",

      "question": "Are the snowboarder’s boots visibly attached to the snowboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the snowboard and boots are illustrated in a simplified, stylized way typical of cartoon art, the boots of the snowboarder appear to be mounted on the snowboard, using visual cues like the alignment of the boots with the board.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon depiction simplifies the snowboarder, and no clear representation of a backpack with shoulder straps is visible in the artwork. The focus is on the snowboarder and other elements like the snowboard itself.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snowboarder is illustrated wearing what appears to be an orange-red ski suit, but the depiction is highly stylized with the simplified flat color style common in cartoon art, and the white diagonal stripes are a hallmark of real-world ski suits, which can be interpreted as present here.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snowboarder's face is not detailed due to the cartoon style and graphical simplifications typical for cover art. However, the character's helmet and flowing hair are illustrated, suggesting motion. The face itself is not visible in any detailed form.",
