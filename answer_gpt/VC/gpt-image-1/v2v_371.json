      "question": "Is the man still wearing a gray T-shirt and black pants while sitting cross-legged on the floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no man in view; instead, a keychain is held in a person's hand. The context of clothes worn by the man doesn't apply to the keychain image, as Image B features entirely different elements.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a plain and neutral background, consistent with Image A's background, with both sharing a similarly uniform and undistracted canvas.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
