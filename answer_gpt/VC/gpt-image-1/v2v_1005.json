      "question": "Are the facial features and accessories (hats, glasses) precisely detailed and recognizable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features are intentionally blurred and not recognizable. In terms of accessory detail, the hats are indeed present and recognizable with clear visual depiction; however, there is no evidence of glasses. Thus, while the hats are recognizable, the overall recognizable detail of facial features and accessories is lacking due to intentional blurring.",
