      "question": "Is the U.S. national insignia (white star within a blue circle, flanked by red and white bars) present on the wings and fuselage of the aircraft?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the aircraft inside the display case does show a stylized representation of the U.S. national insignia, namely a white star within a blue circle, located on the aircraft's wings. However, the insignia does not feature the red and white bars typically flanking it as seen in the more traditional version. Based on U.S. military aircraft insignia standards, the complete insignia involves these additional red and white bars. In Image A, the full insignia is present. Thus, taking into account that Image B portrays a simplified version without the bars, the answer should be 'No'.",

      "question": "Are there two radial engines mounted beneath the wings of the aircraft, one on each side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the small model aircraft within the display case clearly shows two radial engines located beneath the wings, which is consistent with common warbird design. This setup is typical for many WWII-era aircraft which utilized radial engines mounted under the wings for balanced thrust. Comparing with Image A, which also shows a real aircraft with two radial engines beneath the wings, Image B maintains this key design feature. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.",

      "question": "Does each engine have a three-bladed propeller attached to its front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits the engine propeller setup clearly, displaying three blades on each of the aircraft's propellers. This design feature is typical for aircraft engines of both model and real-life, providing efficient thrust in flight. Image A also features three-bladed propellers, reaffirming this common characteristic. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.",

      "question": "Is there a rounded, transparent cockpit canopy located at the front of the fuselage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The model plane in Image B shows a cockpit canopy that is rounded and appears transparent, appropriate for visualizing the cockpit area while maintaining the stylistic look of miniature models. This sort of design allows pilots visibility while protecting them from the elements and is typical in both real and model plane designs. Image A similarly emphasizes a rounded, transparent canopy at the front of the real aircraft. Thus, the answer is 'Yes'.",

      "question": "Do the wings extend straight and symmetrically from the fuselage, forming a dihedral angle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays an aircraft model with wings extending from the fuselage, relatively straight, rather than angled upward. In aeronautical designs, a dihedral angle involves wings typically angled upward to provide stability. The model wings remain parallel to the horizontal plane without angling. Image A presents similarly straight wings for the aircraft in flight. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.",

      "question": "Is the tail section composed of a vertical stabilizer and two horizontal stabilizers with small fins at the ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tail section is visible, consisting of a central vertical stabilizer and horizontal stabilizers extending sideways, a common aircraft design for stability in flight. However, the horizontal stabilizers do not appear to have small fins at their ends, which may sometimes be added for extra stabilization. Image A indeed follows this design without the added fins on the horizontal stabilizers, suggesting the answer should be 'No'.",
