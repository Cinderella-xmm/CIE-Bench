      "question": "Is the \"Schildkr√∂t\" brand name visible on the ball box and/or paddle surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no realistic depictions or direct representations of brand names or text related to table tennis equipment. Instead, the image is a cartoon-style illustration showing anthropomorphized paddles without brand markings. The design and style serve to create an adventurous theme with characters, rather than highlighting specific brand names or product details.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the paddles clearly depicted with one red rubber surface and one blue rubber surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon-style illustration features two table tennis paddles as characters: one red and one blue. The paddles are personified and not depicted as traditional equipment with distinct surfaces. Instead, their entire bodies, including 'faces,' take on one color each. This design moves away from practical representation towards a more animated, narrative-driven depiction.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a diamond-shaped logo present on the handle of each paddle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, which is a cartoonish representation, there are no discernible logos or brand markings, including diamond-shaped logos, on the paddles. The paddles are designed as characters with expressive features, focusing more on storytelling rather than specific product details or logos.",
      "weight": 2,

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are exactly two paddles included in the set?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features two paddles as cartoon characters that are engaging in an adventure narrative. While this imaginative depiction includes two paddle-like characters, they are not part of a traditional set or box of equipment as depicted in standard imagery. Hence, they are not counted in terms of a set inclusion.",

      "question": "Is a rope handle visibly attached to the left side of the box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of a physical box or rope handle. The illustration is dedicated to showcasing a cartoon adventure scenario with animated paddles, therefore lacking any depiction of packaging details such as handles or boxes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a horizontal partition inside the box that separates and holds the paddles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "This question pertains to features inside a box, yet Image B does not display a box. Instead, it shows a treasure chest with characters emerging from it. The focus on narrative rather than packaging precludes the presence of practical elements such as partitions inside the container.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the box have a rectangular shape with a hinged lid that opens upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a treasure chest is illustrated, which has a more stylized, non-rectangular form with a distinct rounded lid. Unlike the practical packaging in Image A, it is not realistically rectangular, and its design is thematic rather than functional, representing an adventurous theme.",
