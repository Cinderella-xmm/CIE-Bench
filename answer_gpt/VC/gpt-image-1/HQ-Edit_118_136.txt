    "Question": "Q1: Is the skater depicted in a mid-air crouched posture with both arms extended outward for balance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the skater is shown in a mid-air crouched position. This posture is common for skateboarders to maintain balance during a jump, which involves bending the knees and extending the arms to either side. The visual cues such as the bent legs and elevated body position suggest this common skateboarding technique.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Is the skater’s left foot placed firmly on the skateboard while the right foot is slightly raised off the board?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the skater's posture indicates that both feet are on the skateboard, as is typical for optimizing control in the air. The image's details, such as the positioning of the legs and feet, suggest this setup rather than having one foot lifted.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the skater’s head and eyes look toward the right side of the frame, indicating forward momentum?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the skater is facing the right side of the frame. However, the helmeted head doesn't provide details on the eyes' direction. Skateboarders typically look in the direction of movement for better navigation, making this likely, despite the lack of explicit facial details.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the skater positioned above the surface of the ramp, indicating he is airborne?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the skater visually above the ramp, implying he is airborne. This is evident from the shadow below the skateboard and the elevated position of the skater's body, which aligns with typical airborne maneuvers in skateboarding.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a second person, an older man in a dark jacket, visible in the background running across the ramp?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background does not include a figure identifiable as an older man in a dark jacket. The setting is a neon-toned, abstract cityscape with another skater in the mid-distance, not consistent with the described character in a realistic setting.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a curved ramp structure forming a bowl-like shape in the foreground, beneath the skater?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scene takes place in a futuristic, urban environ with stylized ramps. However, it does not display a specific, bowl-like ramp beneath the skater. Instead, the aesthetic suggests a general urban skate park without precise bowl formations.",
    "answer": "No"
