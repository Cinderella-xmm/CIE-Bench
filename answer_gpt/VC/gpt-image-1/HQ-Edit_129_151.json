      "question": "Is the elderly man depicted with white hair and a white mustache?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly man's hair is depicted with white lines indicating he has white hair. The illustration style uses contour lines to suggest features; a white mustache is suggested below the blurred area, consistent with Japanese woodblock print style which uses such a portrayal for facial hair. The white mustache can be inferred from the character design typical of such artistic renderings.",

      "question": "Are the chess pieces composed of rubber ducks in green, pink, and yellow colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chess pieces are simplified but clearly illustrated as ducks through their round shapes and beaks. The colors are indicated with variations in shading: green, pink, and one yellow duck, which aligns with the deliberate choice of color simplification commonly seen in illustrations.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the chessboard visible beneath the duck pieces, with a green-and-brown checkered pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the checkered board beneath the ducks is depicted with alternating squares, suggesting a checkered pattern. The use of two shading tones hints at a green-and-brown combination for the squares, which is a conventional color choice for chessboards in designs and aligns with typical board game layouts.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the man seated with his arms crossed and leaning slightly forward toward the board?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the man with his arms depicted across his front, giving the impression they are crossed. His posture, indicated by contour lines illustrating a slight forward lean over the board, suggests an attentive and engaged position, which matches the context of observing a chess game.",

      "question": "Is there a reflective pond visible directly behind the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a body of water is suggested behind the man, with stylized lines indicating reflection or shimmer on its surface. The placement behind the table corresponds to where a pond would logically be, although the illustrative style means less detail is presented compared to photographically realistic images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's clothing is drawn with long, layered sleeves and visible fold lines, characteristic of traditional kimono attire, which is commonly depicted with these features in art. This is further emphasized by the use of contour lines depicting fabric draping over the body, typical in historical Japanese art styles.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, in the illustrated scene, a yellow duck is presented on what can be perceived as the rightmost square on the board based on the layout and the coloring used for orientation. This stylistic choice mirrors traditional compositions in artwork for placing emphasis.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses contour lines to replicate the effect of large trees framing the composition on both sides. This art style captures the essence of trees with scattered foliage, which situates the scene in a natural setting and frames the central subject, providing a visual boundary.",
