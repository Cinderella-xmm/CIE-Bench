      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustrated character is holding a basketball in their right hand, evident from the positioning and grip of the hand around the ball. This detail is portrayed with clarity in the caricature style.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a basketball hoop with a red rim and white net mounted on a backboard above the graffiti wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
