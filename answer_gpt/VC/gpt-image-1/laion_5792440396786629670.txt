    "Question": "Q1: Is there a central root node labeled or represented as 'HOMEPAGE' positioned at the top center of the diagram?",
    "explanation": "In the second image, there is no structure resembling a site architecture plan or a diagram. Instead, it depicts a whimsical treasure map with various elements including a castle, trees, a wizard, and a dragon. These elements are arranged aesthetically rather than systematically.
