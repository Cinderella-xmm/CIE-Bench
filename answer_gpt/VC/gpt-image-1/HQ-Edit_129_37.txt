    "Question": "Q1: Are the cardinal direction labels N, E, S, and W clearly visible and correctly positioned on the embossed compass face of the perfume bottle?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the perfume bottle does not show any visible cardinal direction labels N, E, S, or W on the embossed compass face. The design focuses on aesthetics rather than functionality, omitting these directional markers. The perfume bottle primarily emphasizes the compass rose without the detailed labeling typically found on a traditional compass. Therefore, the answer is based on the absence of these labels.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the full 360-degree scale with numerical markings (e.g., 0, 90, 180, 270) present and evenly spaced around the outer edge of the embossed compass face?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the embossed compass face on the perfume bottle does not depict a full 360-degree scale with numerical markings. The design is more symbolic, lacking the functionality of a numerical degree scale that might be present in a traditional compass. This conclusion is drawn from observing the artistic and simplified representation.",
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the embossed compass face retain the original eight-pointed star-like radial pattern with symmetrical arms extending from the center?",
    "explanation": "The edited image features an embossed compass face on the perfume bottle that retains the eight-pointed star-like radial pattern with symmetrical arms extending from the center, similar to artistic depictions of a traditional compass rose. This pattern, characterized by equal arm lengths radiating symmetrically, is preserved in the design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the body of the perfume bottle perfectly circular in shape, matching the original compassâ€™s outline?",
    "explanation": "The body of the perfume bottle in the edited image is indeed circular, matching the outline of a traditional compass. This conclusion is based on its consistent curved edges and the absence of any irregularities or deviations from a circular form.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the cap of the perfume bottle feature engraved cartographic details such as a compass rose and intersecting grid lines, matching those seen on the map fragments?",
    "explanation": "The cap of the perfume bottle in the edited image does not feature engraved cartographic details like a compass rose or intersecting grid lines. The cap is smooth with a simple engraving design and lacks the intricate map-like details shown on the map fragments in the original image.",
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a small central raised dot or hub at the exact center of the embossed compass face, corresponding to the original needle pivot?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, there is indeed a small central raised dot or hub on the embossed compass face of the perfume bottle. This design element corresponds to a traditional needle pivot on a compass, serving as a central focal point in the design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the outer ring of the embossed compass face clearly delineated with fine engravings and consistent spacing between degree marks?",
    "explanation": "The outer ring of the embossed compass face on the perfume bottle in the edited image is not delineated with fine engravings or consistent spacing between degree marks. The design emphasizes aesthetics over functional markings, lacking the detailed engravings that would signify functional degree marks.",
    "answer": "No"
