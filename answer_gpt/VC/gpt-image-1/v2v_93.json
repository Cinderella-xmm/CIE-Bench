      "question": "Does the thermometer retain its circular shape and metallic rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the thermometer is visibly circular, and it has a metallic rim, distinct from its background. Through visual observation, it's clear that the structure and design reflect a typical circular thermometer design, which aligns with world knowledge of how thermometers are commonly designed for readability and durability. These elements are consistent with those in Image A.",

      "question": "Are the temperature scale markings (-2°C to 200°C) clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the temperature scale markings ranging from -2°C to 200°C are clearly presented around the circumference of the thermometer. The markings are legible and placed with precision on the dial, consistent with how temperature gauges display readings for accurate measurement. This reflects the typical design for clarity and precision.",

      "question": "Is the needle present and positioned correctly relative to the temperature scale?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The needle is a key component of a thermometer and serves to point to the current temperature reading. In Image B, the needle is present and positioned correctly in relation to the temperature scale, positioned to read approximately 0°C, which shows proper alignment and functionality. This positioning is visually consistent with traditional thermometer operation.",

      "question": "Is the text \"TEMPERATURE\" still visible in the center of the thermometer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of the word 'TEMPERATURE', the word 'THERMOMETER' is visible, placed centrally on the face of the thermometer. This text differs from Image A, where 'TEMPERATURE' was centrally placed. This alteration changes the labeling and suggests a different logical purpose in this particular design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the thermometer retain a white face for clear visibility of the markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face of the thermometer appears to maintain a light color, similar to white, which contrasts against the markings for clear visibility. While the exact hue might differ slightly, the premise of facilitating readability through high contrast is consistent with design principles for instruments meant for quick reading. This aligns with traditional thermometer designs that use a white or very light face.",
