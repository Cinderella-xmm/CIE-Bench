      "question": "Is the subject's skin tone dark brown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's skin tone is represented in shades that are consistent with a dark brown color. This determination is made by observing the color used throughout the image. Given that this is a stylized illustration, darker tones are used both in the areas of shadow and consistent skin tone representation across the drawing.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there at least one sunflower placed in the subject's hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drawing includes several sunflower elements incorporated into the subject's hair design. The detailed pattern shows sunflowers integrated into the swirling lines of the hair, which is consistent with the visual representation of sunflowers close to the head.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the subject wearing a yellow dress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject in Image B is depicted with lines suggesting the outline of a dress in the stylized design. The pattern around the shoulders and upper body, colored in yellow hues, suggests she's wearing a garment that conceptually represents a yellow dress consistent with what can be expected in such detailed stylized artworks.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the subject's head turned slightly to her right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the direction of the head can be assessed based on the stylized lines running through the hair and neckline. These suggest a slight turn of the head to the subject's right, akin to a profile view or minor turn in such stylized artistic representation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the subject standing within a sunflower field?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a multitude of sunflowers vertically aligned around the subject, suggesting the depiction is centered within a sunflower field. The intricate background includes repeating sunflower motifs supporting this conclusion.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized follow-through of the lines doesn't provide explicit directional lighting. The illustration uses uniform coloring and doesn't illustrate shading or light source direction like traditional illustration techniques this leaves the accurate direction of light source indeterminate.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the subject have a visible smile showing her teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area that would typically show facial features is intentionally obscured or stylized. Therefore, there is no depiction of a smile or visible teeth in the stylized illustration.",
