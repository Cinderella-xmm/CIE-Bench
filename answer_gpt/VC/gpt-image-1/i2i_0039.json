      "question": "Is the adult polar bear positioned behind the two cubs, with the cubs visibly interacting with each other?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe a family of three polar bears on the ice floe. The adult polar bear appears to be positioned behind the two cubs. The cubs are close together, indicating a form of interaction as they face towards each other while being cuddled close to the adult bear. This arrangement suggests a familial interaction typical of polar bear behavior.",

      "question": "Are the detailed textures of the ice and snow, including ridges and smooth patches, still present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the ice floe appears textured with visible ridges and smooth areas, suggesting detailed snow and ice formations. These features are critical to depicting the natural environment in which polar bears thrive, allowing viewers to understand their habitat's conditions.",

      "question": "Is the ocean backdrop visible behind the ice floe, showing the dark blue water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dark blue water of the ocean is indeed visible in the background of Image B. It contrasts with the lighter colors of the ice and snow, emphasizing the environment surrounding the polar bears. The visibility of such an oceanic backdrop provides context to the polar bears' icy habitat.",

      "question": "Are the natural lighting and shadow effects on the polar bears and ice preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears somewhat altered due to a bluish tint over the image. Despite this, there are still discernible shadows and a sense of natural lighting on the polar bears and the ice, even though the overall effect seems softer, possibly to add emphasis on the 'Climate Crisis' theme.",
