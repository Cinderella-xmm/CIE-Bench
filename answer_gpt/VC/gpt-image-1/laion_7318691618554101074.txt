    "Question": "Q1: Are there exactly eight upright objects arranged in a tight vertical cluster within the container?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the container holds seven crystal-topped objects arranged vertically. The objects are closely positioned but there are seven visible, not eight. This is analyzed by visually counting the objects within the container.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a bed of small, uniformly shaped spherical objects filling the lower portion of the container?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no small spherical objects visible at the bottom of the container. Instead, the container is filled with crystal-topped objects and is clear, indicating the absence of any spherical filler.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a decorative band located precisely at the upper rim of the container?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a decorative etching on the container, but it is not in the form of a band around the rim. Instead, the design is on the body of the glass with no fabric or physical band at the rim.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the container transparent, allowing full visibility of the contents inside?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a completely transparent glass container, providing full visibility of the contents inside, which are crystal-topped objects.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are all the objects positioned vertically, with their tips pointing upward?",
    "explanation": "The objects in Image B are all positioned vertically with their tips pointing upward, consistent with their arrangement and typical placement within such containers.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there at least three distinct sizes of objects visible in the cluster (large, medium, small)?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, all objects appear to be of similar size with slight variations in the crystal tops, but not distinct enough to categorize them into three different size categories such as large, medium, and small.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the container resting on a flat, horizontal surface?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the container placed on a flat, horizontal surface, which can be inferred from the reflection seen below the glass, indicative of a flat table or countertop.",
    "answer": "Yes"
