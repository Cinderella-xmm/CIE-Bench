    "Question": "Q1: Is the player depicted wearing a red shirt with black shorts in all frames?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the player is illustrated wearing a short-sleeved shirt and shorts. The coloring appears uniform across all frames as a single color tone pattern rather than specific colors like red or black used for contrast. Descriptions of specific colors like 'red' or 'black' are more visible in photographs like Image A, where the player wears a red shirt and black shorts, but such contrast is not evident in the edited illustration. Thus, the depiction of 'red shirt with black shorts' is indiscernible.",

    "Question": "Q5: Does the yellow tennis ball appear consistently across all frames, maintaining its bright color and position relevance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a ball is depicted consistently across the frames as part of each tennis action scene, but due to the monochromatic nature of the illustration, the ball does not possess a bright color or provide specific color context such as 'yellow.' However, its positional relevance to the action is maintained, with its presence vital to conveying the motion sequence.",
    "answer": "No"
