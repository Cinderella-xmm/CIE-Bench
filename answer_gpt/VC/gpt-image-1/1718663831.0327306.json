      "question": "Is the dog's fur primarily white with distinct sandy-colored spots on the ears and face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure sitting on the shelf is likely a plush toy representation of a dog, and it demonstrates primarily white fur as noted from its body and limbs. Sandy-colored spots, typically associated with real dogs, are present on its ears and potentially the face (though not visible here since the head section is blurred). This interpretation aligns with common design characteristics of plush toys or figurines modeled after certain dog breeds or styles, giving the illusion of sandy spots being present.",

      "question": "Does the dog have a rounded head with pointed ears and a short muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the available information in Image B, particularly focusing on the visible portions away from the blurred section, the stuffed animal seems to exhibit features typical of a 'cute' plush toy design. Such toys often have rounded heads and can sometimes feature pointed ears as part of their appeal. The short muzzle, a trait often associated with certain types of toy dogs, however, is difficult to confirm due to the blurring. Nevertheless, the design general attributes align with the description of a rounded head and potentially pointed ears.",

      "question": "Are the dog wearing black rectangular sunglasses with dark lenses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, which showcases a plush toy of a dog lacking any evident accessories like sunglasses, there is no indication of black rectangular sunglasses with dark lenses. Typical plush dogs do not often come bedecked with real or sewn-on sunglasses unless explicitly designed for novelty purposes.",

      "question": "Is the dog seated upright with its body facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush toy of a dog is perched on a shelf, oriented facing forward with a posture indicating a seated, upright position. This is a standard design choice meant to simulate the way real dogs sit and also ensure stability when placed on surfaces.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the dog have a compact body with short legs and a fluffy tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From the visual cues in Image B, the plush toy dog indeed appears to have a compact body, consistent with toy dog designs prioritizing cute, manageable proportions. While the legs seem appropriately short, typical of stuffed representations, other features like the tail remain either unclear or crafted not to extend far from the body, which aligns with common stuffed dog characteristics wherein tails are either represented stuffing-wise or omitted.",
