    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the image retain the oval-shaped black sink?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sink is round rather than oval and has a stone-like material, contrasting with the black color seen in Image A's oval sink. The analysis involves observing the shape and color directly, alongside inferencing from visual cues indicating material differences.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the mirror still rectangular with an orange backlight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a rectangular mirror, similar to Image A, but lacks any backlighting. The contrast involves noticing the presence of warm lighting in Image A and its absence in Image B, determining that the mirror does not have an orange backlight in the edited image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the cabinet underneath the mirror remain a floating style with the same position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of Image B shows there is no floating cabinet below the mirror as seen in Image A. Instead of a modern floating style, Image B has a traditional cabinet fixed on pillars, reflecting significant design changes. The floating cabinet seen earlier is clearly absent, based on direct observation.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there metallic faucets present in the sink setup?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while faucets are present, they appear to have a brass or bronze finish, contrasting with the metallic finish in Image A, determined through visual inspection of material and color tone differences.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the window still positioned next to the sink?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the design where the window is located next to the sink, similar to the daylight visibility and structural positioning observed in Image A. The spatial alignment in both images supports this conclusion.",
