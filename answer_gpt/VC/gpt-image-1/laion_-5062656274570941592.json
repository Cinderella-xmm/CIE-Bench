      "question": "Is Joseph depicted holding a lantern in his right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Joseph is shown holding something in his right hand, but it does not resemble a lantern. Instead, it appears to be a closed object that is more ornate. This suggests that Joseph is depicted with a different object than a lantern. Comparing with Image A is not necessary here because we are asked to evaluate only Image B for this question.",

      "question": "Is Mary shown kneeling with both hands clasped in front of her chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Mary is depicted in a posture that does not resemble kneeling. Her hands are not clasped in front of her chest as would be typical in a prayerful position. Instead, she seems to be slightly bending forward with her hands in a different gesture. This observation is based solely on the visual cues in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the infant Jesus lying in a manger with a halo composed of radiating lines around his head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the infant Jesus is shown lying in a structure resembling a manger, but the halo around his head is a circular pattern with dots and is not made of radiating lines. The halo style usually depicts a traditional sense of holiness and has a solid shape in this image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are a donkey and a sheep present in the scene, positioned near the manger?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly depicts a donkey and a cow near the manger, typically representing animals present at the Nativity scene. However, there is no sheep visible in the image. The presence of these animals is based on the visual analysis of the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a five-pointed star positioned at the apex of the roof structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a star positioned at the apex of the arch above the scene, and this star is characterized by having more than five points and some additional decorative design, making it different from a simple five-pointed star. Therefore, stating only five points would be inaccurate based on this observation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stylized palm tree located on the left side of the scene, slightly behind the figures. The tree is visually significant and positioned as part of the setting which could be referencing the nativity setting.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, halos are indeed present around the heads of Joseph, Mary, and Jesus. These halos are typically circular and gilded, signifying their holy status in the nativity depiction.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe the infant Jesus positioned inside a structure that resembles a manger, placed under an arch, which is similar to the representation of being under a roof-like structure in traditional nativity scenes. This is consistent with historical and artistic depictions.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly depicts Joseph on the left side of the stable, Mary on the right, and Jesus centrally positioned between them, which is a common arrangement in depictions of the nativity scene.",
