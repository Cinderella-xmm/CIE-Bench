      "question": "Does the image retain the charred and cooked appearance of the steak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no steak or food items present. Instead, the image depicts a mechanical elephant, and thus there is no context for assessing the appearance of a steak. The visual change is complete and shifts from a culinary theme to an artistic and mechanical one.",

      "question": "Are the broccoli florets still bright green with their natural shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature any broccoli florets or food items. The scene focuses on a mechanical elephant in a foggy forest setting, far removed from a culinary arrangement, making the question about broccoli florets irrelevant.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the carrot slices retain their bright orange color and circular shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no carrot slices or any food visuals as it depicts an entirely different theme involving a mechanical elephant. Hence, considerations of food appearance do not apply.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the steak positioned alongside the vegetables in the same arrangement as the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no steak or vegetables depicted in Image B. The image transformation to a mechanical elephant scene eliminates any original food setup that existed in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scene in Image B is entirely devoid of any table setting, including a colorful striped tablecloth. The setting has transitioned to a forest with a mechanical elephant, which bears no resemblance to the previous table setting.",
