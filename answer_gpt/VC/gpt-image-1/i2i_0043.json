      "question": "Is the tennis player depicted in a crouched stance, preparing to move quickly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis player is shown in a crouched position, which is common in tennis as players often adopt this stance to gain stability and prepare for swift movements. The bent pose of her knees and the lean of her torso indicate she is ready to move. This visual cue, coupled with world knowledge about tennis postures, supports the conclusion that she is indeed preparing to move quickly.",

      "question": "Does the player hold a tennis racket in her right hand, near the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis player is holding a racket very close to the ground. Although the exact hand holding the racket isn’t explicitly shown due to the angled view and artistic render, in tennis, players typically hold a racket intended for immediate use. The proximity of the racket to the ground is clear and visual evidence of its readiness to strike or retrieve a ball.",

      "question": "Is there a ball boy seated on the ground behind the player, observing attentively?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of a ball boy or any similar character in the background. The scene focuses solely on the tennis player and a stylized background, so there’s no visual evidence of a ball boy presence as described.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of dynamic strokes and colors, symbolizing an energetic and possibly abstract representation of motion or light. It lacks any specific logos, brands, or detailed elements like a banner featuring the Perrier logo. Therefore, based on the illustration, there is no visual indication of the Perrier logo.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a stylized tennis court scene with visible white lines, which are customary markings that define areas and boundaries on a tennis court. These lines are slightly apparent amidst the artistically rendered ground and vibrant background, denoting the tennis setting.",
