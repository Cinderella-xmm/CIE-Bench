    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the skater captured mid-air while performing the trick?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater is visibly suspended above the ground, indicating he is in the air. This conclusion is made by observing his legs not making contact with any surface, suggesting he is executing a trick, common in skateboarding where mid-air maneuvers are performed.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the skater's hat still feature the geometric pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the hat on the skater's head displays a pattern that appears to consist of various geometric shapes, such as triangles and possibly lines, consistent with a geometric design. This is inferred from the arrangement of shapes on the hat, typically seen in winter hats with geometric designs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the skateboard positioned below the skater in mid-flip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the skateboard in the air beneath the skater, and its orientation suggests it is flipping. This is determined by observing the skateboard's position and angle which is typical of a flip trick where the skateboard rotates below the skater.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the building facades and tree branches visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals a backdrop where buildings and tree branches can be discerned. They are less vibrant but certainly visible, suggesting that the skater is performing in an urban environment where such elements commonly populate the scenery.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a clear blue sky above the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B shows patches of clear blue sky, indicating good weather conditions. Despite the faded appearance of the edited photo, portions of blue remain visible above the trees and buildings.",
