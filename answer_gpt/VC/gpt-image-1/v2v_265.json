      "question": "Is the rectangular grille located at the front center of the locomotive present in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the locomotive features a rectangular grille at the front center, which is a typical design element often used to indicate the front of locomotives. By observing Image A, the original image, we can see the same rectangular grille present at the front center as part of the locomotive’s structure. This helps with ventilation and cooling, which is a functional aspect in real-life locomotives.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the locomotive has a single illuminated orange-yellow headlight centered above the grille. Checking Image A, the original image, it is observed that the locomotive also has a singular headlight illuminated at the front center. Such headlights on locomotives are necessary for visibility and safety.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, only one set of tracks on which the locomotive travels is depicted. Looking at Image A, several intersecting railway tracks are visible beneath and around the locomotive, which is characteristic of a railway yard typically having multiple converging tracks.",
