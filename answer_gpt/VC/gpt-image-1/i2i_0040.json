      "question": "Is the bike frame still red in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bike frame is clearly illustrated in a red color. This is evident from the use of a solid, bright red hue to depict the frame components, which is a common and vivid representation in graphical depictions of bikes. Thus, the bike frame in Image B is red.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the bike still have a rear rack attached to it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, attentive observation of the bike's rear section shows an illustration of a rear rack. The depiction is consistent with typical visual portrayals of bike racks in graphics, where additional framework extends behind the seat post to accommodate carrying goods. This confirms that the bike in Image B still has a rear rack.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the bike still leaning against a wooden log?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a wooden surface parallel to the ground positioned next to the bike, similar to a bench or log. The bike appears aligned next to this object indicating possible contact for support, consistent with the idea of it leaning against a log. Thus, it suggests the bike is leaning against a log or similar structure.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there grass and scattered leaves visible in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground is graphically represented with uniform green shading, typical of grass in illustrations. Unlike real life, where leaves might be individually depicted, the stylization omits detailed textures like scattered leaves. Therefore, the scene shows grass but not scattered leaves as per typical graphical interpretations.",

      "question": "Is there a tree trunk visible on the left side of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a tree trunk on the left side, depicted in a cutaway style with brown color and a recognizable silhouette distinct from the ground and other elements. This visualization is consistent with typical representations of tree trunks in graphical art, indicating the presence of a tree trunk on the left side of the scene.",
