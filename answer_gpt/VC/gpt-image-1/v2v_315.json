        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the echidna's spines are shown in detail, rendered with distinct and sharp edges, maintaining a naturalistic appearance similar to that in real life. The animal's body shape and texture visually resemble the characteristics of a real echidna. Image A also depicts the echidna with intricately detailed spines and a realistic look. Therefore, Image B retains the detailed spines and naturalistic appearance of the echidna.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases warm, golden hues that envelop the entire scene, providing a soft and surreal lighting typical of a desert or arid environment. This matches the color palette and lighting style depicted in Image A, which has the same warm tones and lighting effects.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the echidna remains positioned close to the girl's feet, suggesting a proximity that is part of the scene composition. In Image A, the echidna is also shown near the lower part of the girl's body, indicating that the positioning is consistent between the two images.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features tall, angular rock formations as part of the background scenery, which contribute to the surreal landscape's aesthetic. These formations are similarly present in Image A, depicting a consistent environmental design. Thus, the tall, angular rock formations in the background are retained in Image B.",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl stands with her hands on her hips and feet firmly on the ground, exuding confidence and poise. This pose is part of the scene composition and adds to the narrative of the image. Similarly, in Image A, the girl maintains a confident pose, contributing to the overall scene composition.
