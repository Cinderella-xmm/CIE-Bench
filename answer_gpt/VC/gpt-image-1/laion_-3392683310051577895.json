      "question": "Is the framed landscape painting with a dark wooden frame and a scene depicting ducks near water present above the sofa?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, there is no clear indication or visual presence of any framed landscape painting above the sofa. The background instead consists of a forest setting that integrates with the sofa's design. This analysis uses visual cues in Image B to determine the absence of the painting described. In Image A, a painting is present but is irrelevant to the analysis of Image B.",

      "question": "Is the wall behind the sofa a consistent cream color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a forest setting rather than an indoor environment. The surrounding instead blends with the wooden and rustic elements of the sofa, creating a consistent natural background filled with trees rather than any uniform wall color. This visual cue indicates no cream-colored wall as described. Comparing with Image A is unnecessary, given Image B's completely different setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the floor covered in a light beige textured carpet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floor in Image B appears as part of a forest-floor with natural earthy textures, such as soil and foliage, rather than any artificial carpet, suggesting a different environmental context. Image A features a light beige carpet, but for Image B, this common sense reasoning highlights the natural terrain instead of a carpet.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a white baseboard molding running along the bottom of the wall behind the sofa?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the natural environmental composition does not showcase any architectural elements such as white baseboards due to the forest setting surrounding the sofa, which is incongruent with an indoor layout. Image A features such baseboards, but the context of Image B lacks these elements.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is a portion of a second brown leather armchair visible on the far left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B solely displays a unique sofa resembling a mystical creature within a woodland setting, without any conventional furniture like a leather armchair visible. Image A shows a portion of an armchair but is irrelevant as Image B contains no similar objects, reinforcing the difference between both environments.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are soft shadows visible beneath the sofa, consistent with indoor ambient lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is natural and emanates from a forest environment, producing soft shadows but not resembling indoor ambient lighting typical with contained spaces and light sources. Image A displays indoor lighting, whereas Image B suggests a natural variant, where shadows come from the forest context, transforming the sofa into a feature of wooded symbolism.",
