      "question": "Does the edited image retain exactly three arms—one central and two lateral—arranged symmetrically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a candelabra with three arms — one central vertical arm and two lateral arms extending from the sides. The symmetry is evident in their balanced arrangement around the central stem. The visual structure of the candelabra supports this symmetrical design. Although Image A also shows three arms arranged symmetrically, this analysis is based solely on the description derived from Image B.",

      "question": "Are the left and right arms symmetrically positioned and shaped relative to the central axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left and right arms are visually identical in terms of their curve and position relative to the central axis of the candelabra. This design reflects a traditional symmetrical layout where both lateral arms are mirror images of each other. The comparison with Image A, which also features symmetrical arms, further supports the symmetry observed in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the base circular, flared, and adorned with a beaded or ridged edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a circular base that flares outwards to provide stability. There is a discernible decorative pattern near the edge that mimics beading or ridging, typical of ornamental bases to add visual interest and tradition. Image A also features a similar design, reinforcing the conclusion in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the central stem remain a tall, tapering vertical shaft connecting the base to the top arms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a central stem that is both tall and tapering, serving as the main structural support connecting the base to the arrangement of arms at the top. This feature is crucial in traditional candelabra designs for both aesthetic and functional purposes. Image A, similarly, shows a tall central stem connecting the arms to the base.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the arms maintain smooth, curved trajectories from the central stem to the top ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arms in Image B demonstrate smooth curves as they extend from the central stem, terminating at the candle holders at their ends. This elegant curve is typical in candelabra designs for aesthetics and structural balance. The trajectory of the arms in Image A also matches this description, confirming the analysis of Image B.",
