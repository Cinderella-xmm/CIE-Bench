      "question": "Does the edited image show the octopus with exactly eight tentacles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the octopus is depicted with several tentacles extending in various directions. By counting these tentacles, it is evident that there are precisely eight tentacles, which aligns with the biological characteristic of octopuses having eight arms. My conclusion is drawn by visually counting each tentacle present in the cartoon illustration.",

      "question": "Are there two distinct, large eyes visible on the octopus’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the octopus with two large, distinct eyes positioned on its head, prominently featuring them as part of its facial structure. The cartoon style highlights these eyes, making them a significant visual feature. The reasoning here involves recognizing the placement and exaggerated style typical of cartoons, aimed at making such features noticeable.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are suction cups visible along the underside of at least some of the octopus’s tentacles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the cartoon depiction of the octopus does not show any detailed suction cups on the underside of the tentacles. In typical cartoon style, details like suction cups might be omitted for simplicity. Therefore, based on the visual content, there are no suction cups visible on the tentacles.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the octopus positioned on or adjacent to the beach, with part of its body in the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the octopus is drawn as sitting on a small mound that appears to be surrounded by water, with its tentacles extending to the vicinity of the beach. This implies that part of the octopus is positioned on an island adjacent to the beach, suggesting that the base of its body may be in water. This assessment considers the spatial relation between the depicted island, the octopus, and the beach.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the octopus clearly the largest and most prominent figure in the image, facing directly toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a composition where the octopus is indeed the largest and most prominent feature of the scene, both in size and positioning, capturing immediate attention as it faces the viewer directly. This is a typical artistic choice to emphasize particular elements in illustrative artwork, particularly in tourism adverts or posters.",

      "question": "Is there a visible stretch of sandy beach meeting the ocean water in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground prominently displays a stretch of sandy beach blending into the ocean, complete with people relaxing on it, which is clearly visible and a crucial part of the beach setting. This visual element is a common feature in drawings and illustrations promoting coastal destinations.",
