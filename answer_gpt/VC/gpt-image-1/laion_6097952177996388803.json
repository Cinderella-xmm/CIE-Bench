    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the two main mountain peaks still present and positioned side by side as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a prominent figure that resembles a large mythical creature which takes up the majority of the frame, rather than two distinct mountain peaks. The figure with its horns and broad shoulders creates a singular focal point, unlike in Image A where two peaks are clearly side by side. Therefore, the presence of side-by-side mountain peaks is not depicted in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the summits of both peaks retain patches of snow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a large creature rather than traditional mountain peaks, and there are no visible snowy summits depicted. The heavy emphasis is on the creature itself, which does not involve snowy features. In Image A, the summits do have snow. However, due to the transformation in the edited image, the snow is no longer present.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the horizontal and vertical rock strata visible on the mountain faces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on a mythical creature, and such geological features like rock strata are not depicted. Instead, the focus is on the characteristics of the figure, such as its mossy appearance and texture. Image A does have visible rock strata on the mountain faces, but this is altered in the edited version.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the narrow road visible winding through the lower valley, extending toward the base of the mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature the landscape elements such as a narrow road, as it primarily focuses on the creature. Image A shows a road winding through the valley, but such a feature is absent due to the transformation seen in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the slopes covered in patches of brownish-orange heather and dry grass, particularly in the mid-ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on a mythological figure that replaces the natural landscape features. There are no visible patches of heather or grass on slopes, as Image B concentrates on the characteristics of the creature. The terrain details seen in Image A are replaced by the depiction of the creature.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the sky uniformly overcast with no direct sunlight, resulting in soft shadows across the landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images have a uniform gray sky that suggests overcast weather without direct sunlight, leading to soft lighting conditions. This atmospheric continuity creates consistent soft shadows both in Image A and in the background of the creature in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question": "Do the valleys show smooth, continuous contour lines that follow the natural slope of the land?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses on the large figure rather than depicting natural valleys with their contour lines. The shape and emphasis are on the creature, not the naturally occurring valleys with smooth contours found in Image A.",
