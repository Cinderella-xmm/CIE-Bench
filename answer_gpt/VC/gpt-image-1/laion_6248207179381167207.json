    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the bag still rectangular in shape with rounded corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bag is no longer rectangular with rounded corners. Instead, it has a distinct rectangular shape with sharp, angular corners. The design appears to be a hard metallic case with clean, precise lines and edges, differing from the typical soft, rounded edge of leather or fabric bags.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the bag retain a flap-over front section with a horizontal crease?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a bag design that lacks a flap-over front section. The entire front surface is a continuous pattern without any separation or overlap indicating a flap. In contrast, a flap-over front typically has an overlapping section which might also be indicated by a horizontal crease.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a zipper running across the top edge of the bag with a visible gold-tone pull tab?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible zipper across the top. The edges are bordered with intricate detailing, but no element resembles a zipper or gold-tone pull tab. The top seems to be a solid part of the bag's structure without any functional opening mechanism visible.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there two vertical stitched panels visible beneath the flap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any vertical stitched panels. Instead, the entire surface is covered by a geometrically symmetrical pattern consistent across the face, and there isn't any indication of stitching or divided sections beneath a non-existent flap.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the bag have an adjustable shoulder strap with brass-colored buckles on both ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bag lacks any visible shoulder strap. The design showcases handles on each side designed as solid bars integrated into the bag's structure, unlike typical adjustable shoulder straps with buckles for length adjustment.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the bag positioned horizontally and upright in the center of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the bag in a horizontal and upright orientation, centered within the frame. This assessment is based on the alignment of the decorative patterns and the symmetric place of handle elements, allowing for a stable viewing direction.",
