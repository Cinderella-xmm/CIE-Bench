      "question": "Does the edited image retain the kitten's original orange fur with white markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible parts of the kitten, such as the ears and paws, maintain an orange fur color and resemble the pattern seen in Image A. While the face is blurred, the consistent fur color and pattern from the visible parts suggest that the edited image retains the original orange fur with white markings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the kitten's greenish-yellow eyes preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes are not clearly visible due to the blurred face. However, based on the context that the visible portions of the kitten maintain its original appearance, and knowing that the changes were more inclined towards a 3D effect, it is reasonable to assume that the eyes, if visible, would remain unchanged. Nonetheless, we cannot definitively state the eyes' color without visual confirmation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image retain the kitten's perked ears, pink nose, and white whiskers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ears of the kitten are visible and remain perked, similar to those in Image A. Given the ears' consistent depiction and the partial view of the face maintaining original qualities, it can be reasonably concluded that the pink nose and white whiskers are retained, even though they aren't wholly visible.",

      "question": "Is the blue blanket with its soft texture maintained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, part of the blue blanket is visible around the kitten and retains its soft, fluffy texture, as seen in Image A. This suggests that the blanket's characteristic look remains unchanged.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the kitten retain its relaxed posture while appearing to leap out of the screen in 3D?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kitten's paws extend outwards, simulating a dynamic 3D effect as if leaping out of the screen. This alters the perception from the relaxed posture seen in Image A, changing it to a more active pose.",
