    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the wide open mouth with visible white teeth?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the edited figure has its face blurred, making it impossible to discern any details about the mouth or teeth. Therefore, the answer must be based on the lack of visible evidence for such features in the edited image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the black eyebrows present and positioned above the eye sockets?",
    "explanation": "The face in Image B is blurred to such an extent that no features can be distinguished. This means that any presence of black eyebrows above eye sockets cannot be visually confirmed. Therefore, without visual indicators, the answer is based on the inability to see these details.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the dark, rounded ears present on both sides of the head?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a dark area visible on the right side of the head that resembles an ear. However, due to blurring, it is impossible to confirm if it appears on both sides or to confidently identify them as ears. Therefore, considering the incomplete or blurred identification of matched features, the answer should reflect only what can be seen clearly.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there two circular eye sockets visible on the face?",
    "explanation": "Due to the face being blurred in Image B, any elements like eye sockets are obscured and not discernible. Hence, the answer relies on the impossibility of seeing such facial features.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a green-colored section on the top of the head?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the head is visible, and there is indeed a green-colored section present, similar to the shape seen in Image A. This means that despite facial blurring, some original features outside the blurred area are retained.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
