    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the intricate iron lattice structure of the Eiffel Tower present, including its characteristic crisscross pattern and open framework?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower is depicted within a miniature snow globe, which means details may be simplified due to scale. Despite the reduction in detail, the miniature captures the distinctive iron lattice structure of the Eiffel Tower, including its crisscross design and open framework, in a more abstracted form, yet still recognizable.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the arched base of the Eiffel Tower visible, with a clear central passage beneath the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature inside the snow globe includes an arched base of the Eiffel Tower. However, the central passage is not prominently visible due to the artistic representation and small scale, but the concept of the arch is still present.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the spire and crown structure at the very top of the Eiffel Tower present and clearly defined?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow globe representation in Image B simplifies the Eiffel Tower's intricate features due to scale, but the spire and crown at the top are present, demonstrated by a slight protrusion and overall shape that suggests their presence.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the rows of lampposts and bare-branched trees symmetrically arranged along both sides of the central path leading to the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow globe in Image B shows a miniature scene where lampposts and bare-branched trees are symmetrically arranged along both sides, aligning with a central path leading to the Eiffel Tower, maintaining the symmetrical design seen in real-life settings.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there figures in the foreground positioned facing the Eiffel Tower, with some appearing to take photographs or observe it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, within the snow globe, miniature figures are positioned facing the Eiffel Tower. Their postures suggest they might be observing it or taking photographs, aligning with typical behavior of tourists at such attractions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the central pathway extend directly toward the Eiffel Tower, creating a strong linear perspective with convergence at the towerâ€™s base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a miniature scene inside a snow globe, where a central pathway is suggested to lead towards the Eiffel Tower, creating a linear perspective. However, due to scale and artistic abstraction, the perspective is implied rather than strongly detailed.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the ground fully covered in snow, with visible accumulation around the base of the tower and along the path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow globe in Image B signifies a fully snow-covered scene. The ground, including areas around the base of the Eiffel Tower and along the path, gives the illusion of snow accumulation, intensified by the snow globe's design.",
