    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the \"Indian\" script logo visible and legible on the fuel tank?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle has markings that say 'FUTURE' on the fuel tank instead of 'Indian.' The visual cues indicate futuristic branding, suggesting a different theme from Image A. Thus, the 'Indian' script logo does not appear in this image.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the engine cylinders arranged in a V-shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the engine cylinders arranged in a configuration typical of a V-twin engine, common in cruiser motorcycles, where the cylinders form a V shape. This arrangement is visible from the structure around the engine area.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there two chrome exhaust pipes running along the right side of the motorcycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle has exhaust pipes, but they are not visibly chrome and appear stylized with neon elements, diverging from the traditional appearance in Image A. The pipes are integrated with a futuristic visual theme, indicating a different design choice.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a black leather seat located above the engine and behind the fuel tank?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there is a seat positioned above the engine and behind the fuel tank, it is part of a stylized representation potentially with futuristic materials and textures that may not distinctly resemble black leather.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the fuel tank white and smooth with rounded contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fuel tank is visually darker and follows a futuristic style, with neon accents that diverge from conventional colors like white shown in Image A. Thus, it does not match the smooth white description.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the exhaust pipes connect directly to the engine block?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, while stylized, indicates exhaust pipes coming from the vicinity of the engine area, suggesting they are theoretically connected to the engine block as per typical motorcycle design, but visual styling makes direct examination challenging without explicit cues.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the motorcycle have a low-slung, cruiser-style silhouette with a forward-leaning stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a motorcycle that has a low-slung silhouette and a cruiser aesthetic characteristic of such bikes, with visual signals indicating a forward-leaning stance through its design lines and proportions. This aligns with the silhouette evident in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
