    "Question": "Q1: Is the American flag patch present on the right shoulder of the astronaut?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut is illustrated in a cartoon style. Upon examination, the astronaut does not display any specific flag patches on the shoulder; instead, the illustration is simple and stylized. By comparison, Image A features a realistic depiction of an astronaut with an American flag patch on the right shoulder. Since Image B lacks this detail, the answer is determined.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is Earth visible in the reflection within the astronaut’s helmet visor, appearing above the lunar horizon?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, Earth is illustrated within the visor of the astronaut, depicted in a simplified style as would be common in a cartoon, representing a reflection.

    "Question": "Q4: Is the International Space Station visible in the background with its solar panels and modular structure?",
    "explanation": "Image B contains a simplified drawing of what appears to be a space station with solar panels, indicated by the structure's modular look and numerous panel-like shapes.

    "Question": "Q5: Is the ground beneath the astronaut visibly cratered and gray, consistent with the Moon’s surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ground is depicted in a cartoon style with simple, flat geometric shapes and lacks specific texture details like craters, instead of employing a monochrome brownish color that deviates from the realistic gray of the moon shown in Image A. The stylization does not aim for an accurate lunar representation.",

    "Question": "Q6: Is the astronaut facing forward with both side lights on the helmet illuminated?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut appears to be facing forward, indicated by the visor orientation; however, the drawing style simplifies the elements, including the helmet lights, which are not distinctly illustrated as being on. This contrasts with Image A, where the lights on a realistic helmet appear illuminated.",
    "answer": "No"
