      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the girl’s short, straight black bob hairstyle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl is depicted in a chibi art style where details are simplified and exaggerated. Despite this, the girl maintains a short, straight black bob hairstyle consistent with the original style. The representation aligns with typical chibi character designs, where hairstyle is one of the few details that remains similar to a character's original design for recognizable features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the red flower still held in the girl’s left hand in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl is clearly shown holding a red flower in her left hand, as indicated by the positioning of her arm and the flower in this stylistic representation. The flower's continuity from Image A is maintained through the visual cue of the same red spherical flower depicted.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the wave and floral patterns visible in the kimono’s fabric in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the kimono design retains some pattern detailing, the chibi art style simplifies these patterns, making them more abstract and less distinct compared to the detailed wave and floral patterns in Image A. Chibi art generally reduces intricate detailing in favor of broader, more colorful representations.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the vendor trays arranged symmetrically on both sides of the alley in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background art style abstracts and simplifies the elements, focusing more on broad color expressions and less on precise symmetries or details like the arrangement of trays. The detailed symmetrical arrangement from Image A isn't visibly retained due to these artistic choices.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the floor tiles gray and arranged in a grid pattern in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tiles and other intricate features of the ground are not explicitly represented in the chibi drawing of Image B. The artistic style omits these detailed features, focusing instead on the character and simplified background representations.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the vertical banners with Japanese calligraphy still present beneath the hanging objects in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, Image B's art style forgoes specific textual and banner details like those in Image A. The focus is primarily on a stylized, colorful presentation, rather than accurately depicting language or signage details.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the girl positioned centrally in the alleyway between the two rows of trays in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the girl in a more centered and recognizable position in relation to any implied background elements due to the consistent placement and focus of the character, which is a hallmark of such simplified art styles that enhance character prominence.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there multiple hanging objects aligned in rows above the alleyway in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background detail is minimal, with fewer hints of layered decorative objects like lanterns seen in Image A. The focus is mainly on the central character, with less emphasis on complex structural features above.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Are there seated figures behind the trays on both sides of the alley in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B removes detailed background elements and people, typical in art styles that highlight characters. The focus is on the character, with other entities like seated figures in the complex environment from Image A not being distinctly represented.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q10",
      "question": "Are the trays filled with visibly distinct colored goods (e.g., red, blue, pink) in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image uses a chibi style, focusing on the character with less detailed representation of surroundings. The trays and their contents, which are visible and colorful in Image A, are not explicitly portrayed or easily identifiable in Image B, as the style prioritizes simplicity.",
