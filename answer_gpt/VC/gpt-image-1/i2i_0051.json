      "question": "Does the image retain the gesture of both women shaking hands over the tennis net?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two women are visibly extending their right arms towards each other over the tennis net. Their hands are visibly connected in a handshake gesture.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both women have visible tennis rackets in their hands. The woman on the left is holding her racket in her left hand, and the woman on the right has her racket in her right hand. This detail is consistent with typical tennis players who maintain their rackets to the side when not actively playing.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the tennis court appears to be a textured version of what is classically represented as green with dark green or brownish hues. The lines dividing and marking the sections are visible and appear light against the darker court surface. Typically, tennis courts are depicted with these contrasting colors to denote the boundaries clearly.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no tennis ball visible on the ground court area. The composition doesn't show any objects resembling a tennis ball in any visible court area where the two women are present. This suggests the absence of a tennis ball on the playing surface.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly features a tennis net prominently at the center of the court, spanning the distance between the two women. It separates the two tennis players physically, as is typical in tennis matches, demarcating each player's side of the court according to the sport's play rules.",
