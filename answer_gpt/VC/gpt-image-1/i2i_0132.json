        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the frisbee can be seen positioned between the two individuals, elevated in the air, implying an ongoing game or interaction between them.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues depict the male individual with his arms slightly extended forward and angled upward, suggesting he might have thrown the frisbee or is preparing to catch it.
