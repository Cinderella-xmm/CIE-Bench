      "question": "Is the flared leg silhouette preserved in the transformed design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle is designed to mimic the shape of a pair of jeans. The bottom part of the bottle has an outward flare, similar to the hem of flared jeans. This shape was likely inspired by the flared leg silhouette seen in actual jeans, suggesting the designer intended to retain the flared characteristic in the transformation.",

      "question": "Are the lace-up details present on the outer sides of the lower legs in the transformed design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts details that resemble the lace-up elements on the outer side of the jeans' lower legs, visible from the bottle's designed lace pattern near one side of the bottle. The art intends to replicate the unique design feature of lace-up jeans in the perfume bottle shape.",

      "question": "Is the denim blue color retained in the transformed design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle is rendered in a color that closely matches the classic denim blue shade found in Image A. The color choice serves to reinforce the connection between the denim jeans and the perfume, showing the designer's intent to maintain the color continuity in the transformed design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the side profile view maintained in the transformed design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a front-facing view of the perfume bottle which visually conveys the design details well but does not represent a side profile. This differs from Image A, where jeans are shown in a profile view, implying that the transformation opts for a different visual perspective to highlight other aspects.",

      "question": "Is the proportional length and tapering from knee to ankle preserved in the transformed design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle design mirrors the overall shape of jeans but does not fully maintain the proportional length and tapering as seen from knee to ankle in Image A. The bottle has its own proportion and design scale focusing more on stylistic representation rather than exact tapering details.",
