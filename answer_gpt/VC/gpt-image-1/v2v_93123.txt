    "Question": "Q1: Does the elderly man retain his white hair and mustache?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly man is partially visible from the side; we can observe his white hair, but the area where a mustache would be is obscured by the blur. Based on typical depictions of elderly gentlemen with a similar appearance, it is reasonable to assume he may have a mustache. Without explicit visual evidence of a mustache in Image B, we rely more on contextual clues than direct observation.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is the elderly man still gazing contemplatively toward the pineapple?",
