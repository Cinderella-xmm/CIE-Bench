      "question": "Is the motorcycle red in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle is primarily colored in shades of red, which is a bright and easily distinguishable color. The visual cues clearly show the motorcycle body colored in red, which aligns with my common knowledge that red stands out distinctly against other colors.",

      "question": "Is the truck blue in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a truck that is predominantly blue. Given the visual cue of a solid color surrounding the truck's body and my knowledge of typical truck colors, the shade present corresponds to blue. The cartoonish style of drawing simplifies recognition of color.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the rider wearing a black helmet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the image, the rider is depicted with a helmet colored in dark hues resembling black. The simplistic nature of the drawing combined with knowledge about common motorcycle helmets supports the conclusion that the helmet is black, reflecting the typical choice for motorcycle gear.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question": "Is the rider wearing a black leather jacket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the rider with attire resembling a black leather jacket. This inference is made based on the style and dark color, which is a typical representation of motorcycle gear, especially in stylized illustrations.",

      "question": "Does the motorcycle have a transparent windscreen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The windscreen in Image B is presented without colors that suggest transparency, as transparency is often depicted by absence of color and surroundings visible behind it. However, cartoon imagery often simplifies such details and might adjust transparency to maintain simplicity.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the truck have round headlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck's headlights are drawn as simple geometrical shapes, specifically circles, indicating a round shape. This matches typical truck headlights and cartoon simplification of recognizably round features.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the rider leaning forward over the handlebars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction in the cartoon shows the rider's posture as forward, angled over the handlebars, which is often used in representations to convey speed and control, both common in caricature depictions of motorcycling.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image portrays both vehicles in parallel orientation, occupying adjacent vertical space in the scene, suggesting they are side by side relative to each other, which fits with common presentation of passing or repositioning vehicles in art.",
