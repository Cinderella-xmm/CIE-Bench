      "question": "Is the \"Canon\" logo present in white text on the top of the camera body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts an animated camera character in a cartoon style. The camera character has a similar shape to the Canon camera but does not show the 'Canon' logo in white text. The top of the camera has a hat instead, suggesting a thematic adventure concept. Without the logo visible, it suggests the answer is No.",

      "question": "Is the \"SX 60 HS\" text visible in silver lettering on the lower right side of the camera body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited camera character does not feature the text 'SX 60 HS' visible in silver lettering. The editing transformed the camera into a cartoon character, omitting specific text details present in the authentic camera model from Image A.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the inscriptions \"CANON ZOOM LENS 65x IS\" and \"3.8-247.0mm 1:3.4-6.5 USM\" visible around the lens barrel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lens of the cartoon camera character shows a simplified design, and while the lens does contain some text, it is not clear enough to confirm the presence of the specific inscriptions 'CANON ZOOM LENS 65x IS' and '3.8-247.0mm 1:3.4-6.5 USM'. This suggests these inscriptions are not visibly present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B replaces the textured grip area with a cartoon-style illustration that represents arms and hands of a character. The grip area found in Image A is transformed into part of a fictional design, removing the specific pebbled or dimpled texture structure.",

      "question": "Is the mode dial located on the top left of the camera body, near the grip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite being a cartoon illustration, Image B shows a dial on the top left side, similar to the mode dial location. Thus, based on the presence of a dial-like structure, it confirms the answer as Yes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animated camera doesn't have a small circular flash unit above the lens area. The cartoon features and design modification remove such specific hardware details, making the answer No.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B transforms the camera into a cartoon character and retains the black color for the main body of the camera character, consistent with the camera design. Thus, the main body remains black, confirming the answer as Yes.",
