    "Question": "Q1: Is the balance beam made of wood with visible wear and chipped paint?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not display any realistic element like a balance beam made of wood; it is characterized by an artistic starry background, not a gym setting. Thus, the idea of a wooden beam doesn't apply.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is the leotard divided into silver upper body and blue lower body with a gradient transition and sparkles along the spine?",

    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the gymnast’s hair styled in a tight bun secured with a blue hair tie?",
