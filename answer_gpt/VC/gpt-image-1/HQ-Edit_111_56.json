      "question": "Are both feet positioned en pointe, with the right foot slightly ahead of the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, observing the lower body of the statue reveals that both feet are positioned en pointe, as typical of ballet dancers. The right foot appears slightly ahead, suggesting a forward step or a ballet posture where weight is distributed on the toes. This conclusion is drawn from the distinctive pose that is common in ballet where one foot often leads to maintain balance and aesthetic form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both arms extended laterally from the body, with palms facing inward and fingers gently curved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the statue’s arms are extended outward but in a graceful, slightly downward curve. The palms are facing downward rather than inward, and the fingers are not distinctly curved inwards. This arm position aligns more with a relaxed, natural pose rather than the specific detailed pose described.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the head turned to the left, with the chin slightly raised?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue’s head is turned to the left, as indicated by the position and angle visible in the image. The chin is slightly raised, suggesting a poised expression typical of ballet dancers, who often elevate their chin in this manner for aesthetic presentation.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the legs fully extended and aligned vertically, with the spine slightly arched backward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The observation of Image B's statue shows the legs positioned in a ballet dance posture where they are bent, rather than fully extended and vertically aligned. The spine appears straight rather than arched backward, indicating a balanced stance typical in statues and ballet postures aiming for elegance and control.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the arms positioned at approximately hip level, extending outward from the sides of the torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arms of the statue are slightly elevated from hip level, extending outward in a graceful arc characteristic of ballet poses. While they extend outward from the torso’s sides, the elevation does not reach hip level, pointing more toward a poised posture rather than static hip-level extension.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the upper body slightly tilted forward while maintaining vertical alignment through the spine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the statue maintaining an upright posture without noticeable tilt forward. The vertical alignment of the spine suggests a classic balanced pose rather than one exhibiting a forward tilt, reflecting a typical pose for ballet dancers portraying elegance and concentration.",
