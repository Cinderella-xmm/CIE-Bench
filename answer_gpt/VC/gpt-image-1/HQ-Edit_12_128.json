      "question": "Is the clock face circular and positioned in the center of the wooden frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which features a monochromatic clock, the clock face is clearly circular and situated at the center of the frame, akin to standard wall clocks where the face is the prominent central feature. This layout is common in traditional clock designs, where the circular clock face is positioned centrally for easy reading and aesthetic balance.",

      "question": "Are the Roman numerals arranged in clockwise order from I to XII around the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the Roman numerals on the clock face start from I and progress in regular intervals around the circular face, concluding with XII. This sequential arrangement is typical in analog clock designs to facilitate time-telling, where numbers advance in a clockwise manner.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows a pendulum hanging directly below the clock face. There appear to be two vertical rods or bars from which the decorative pendulum is suspended. This setup resembles classical clock designs where a pendulum is centrally placed for balance and movement.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the architectural theme of the clock frame shows fluted columns positioned on both sides of the clock face. These columns start from the top of the frame and extend towards the bottom, resembling classical design motifs where symmetry and decorative elements are emphasized.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a decorative crest located at the top center of the frame. The design includes ornate, leaf-like carvings, which are typical of classical and ornate furniture and clock designs, often used to add an element of elegance and decoration.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the center of the clock face does not feature a circular medallion. The design is minimalist, sticking to a clean, monochromatic look without additional central embellishments or medallions. This contrasts with more complex designs that include medallions as decorative features.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B does not reveal small rounded feet extending from the bottom corners. The base of the frame ends without additional extensions, consistent with a wall-mounted clock design where such feet would not be structurally necessary or visually present.",
