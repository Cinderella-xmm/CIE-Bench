        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon inspection of the left bell tower, there is no visible clock face present. The tower structure is simpler and lacks detailed elements such as clock faces that might be found on real-life counterparts. Thus, the answer is 'No'.",
