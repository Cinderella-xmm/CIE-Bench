      "question": "Is the kite depicted in the shape of a diamond?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kite is depicted within a photograph and a separate sticker. Both feature the kite with four equal sides and diagonals, forming a symmetrical shape reminiscent of a traditional kite design, commonly referred to as a 'diamond' shape. This aligns with common kite geometries, indicating that the kite is indeed in the shape of a diamond.",

      "question": "Does the kite retain its bright yellow color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kite in both the photograph and sticker appears bright yellow. Yellow is a vibrant color often used for kites to contrast against the sky, making it easily visible when flying. The visual depiction maintains the brightness and consistency of color in both representations.",

      "question": "Are two strings visibly attached to the kite?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the photograph and sticker depiction show a kite with a single string attached. Traditional kites typically are flown with one primary string; despite the possibility of multiple strings in some kite designs, visual evidence here indicates only one, aligning with common designs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The photograph in Image B displays a background featuring a clear blue sky with scattered clouds, commonly associated with a bright day suitable for kite flying. The presence of this sky, both in the photo and sticker, provides the context of the kite being outdoors, up against a typical clear sky backdrop.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kite in both the photograph and sticker of Image B includes a prominently visible yellow tail at the base of the kite. This tail is a common element in kite designs, serving both aesthetic and functional purposes in stabilizing flight.",
