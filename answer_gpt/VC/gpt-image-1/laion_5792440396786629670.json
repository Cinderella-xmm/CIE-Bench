        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second image, there is no structure resembling a site architecture plan or a diagram. Instead, it depicts a whimsical treasure map with various elements including a castle, trees, a wizard, and a dragon. These elements are arranged aesthetically rather than systematically. Therefore, there is no 'HOMEPAGE' node present or any structured diagram format that one would expect in a sitemap. Based on this understanding, the answer is No.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The second image contains various illustrations of a treasure map theme, including a castle, trees, wizard, and other thematic elements. There is no indication of any structured branches or nodes akin to a flowchart or site map architecture. As such, there are no branches labeled as described in the question. Hence, the answer is No.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The second image does not include any formal site map legend or a systematic guide. Instead, it consists of graphical elements typical of a fantasy treasure map, such as a dragon, wizard, trees, and a castle. Thus, there is no legend or 'SITE MAP KEY' as would be expected in a schematic diagram or an architecture plan. Therefore, the answer is No.",

It does not contain any corporate branding or logos typically associated with business materials, such as 'to the web'.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second image, there is no designated footer section at the bottom. The image is filled with thematic elements related to a treasure map with no text or structured sections like 'Privacy Policy' or 'Site Map' that are typically found in a footer.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The second image is dominated by a playful collection of illustrations such as a wizard, a dragon, and other fantasy icons, which are not organized in a node or branch structure.

      "explanation": "In the second image, there is no structured layout or hierarchy that suggests nodes or branches related to products or product details. It's a treasure map-themed illustration without any text labeling nodes such as 'Product #3' or 'Product Details'. Consequently, the answer is No.",
