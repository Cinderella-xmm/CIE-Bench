      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the bag character reflects the earthy tones apparent in the body of the bag, as seen in the brown and warm color palette which matches the original.

      "question": "Is the bag character's structural design, including visible stitching, preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bag character displays features similar to its structure in Image A, such as its overall cylindrical shape and the positioning of handles and straps. However, finer details like visible stitching are absent due to the stylized nature of the cartoon illustration in Image B. The simplified design elements focus more on the animation style and facial expressions rather than detailed stitching patterns.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bowl character maintains its white color, as well as its rounded bowl shape, which appears consistent with its portrayal in Image A. The cartoon form in Image B simplifies the shape but retains the essence of being a white, rounded bowl.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden floor can be seen in both panels of Image B, consistent with the environment setting observed in Image A. The color tone and panel lining simulates the wooden texture, indicating that the manga panels do preserve the representation of a wooden floor background.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both panels illustrate the bag character in proximity to the bowl character, similar to how they are positioned in Image A. The spatial relationship and relative positioning are maintained, although the posing and interaction between characters adds dynamism to the scene.",
