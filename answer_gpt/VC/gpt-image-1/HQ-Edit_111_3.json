      "question": "Does the butterfly retain its original iridescent electric blue wing color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is prominently featured with its wings spread, showcasing a vibrant electric blue color. This color can be described as iridescent, as it appears vivid and striking against the background. In Image A, the same electric blue color is present. Therefore, the butterfly in Image B retains its original wing color.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the dark black edges along the outer margins of the butterfly’s wings preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the butterfly's wings exhibit a dark outline along the edges, defining the boundary of each wing. This characteristic is also present in Image A. Thus, the butterfly's wings in Image B maintain the dark black edges along their outer margins.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the butterfly depicted with both wings fully extended and symmetrically open?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the butterfly with both of its wings fully extended in a symmetrical manner, creating a balanced appearance. The same is observed in Image A, where the wings are also symmetrically open. Therefore, in Image B, the butterfly is depicted correctly with its wings fully extended and symmetrically open.",
      "weight": 3,

      "question": "Is the bright pink cosmos flower directly beneath the butterfly still present and clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a bright pink cosmos flower is located directly beneath the butterfly, prominently visible in the composition. Image A also features this pink flower in the same position relative to the butterfly. The presence and visibility are maintained consistently in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the yellow stamens forming the central disc of the pink flower visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the yellow stamens at the center of the pink flower, forming a distinct central disc at the flower’s core. Image A exhibits these same yellow stamens in a similar position and visibility. Thus, the pink flower's yellow stamens are visible in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the butterfly physically touching the surface of the pink flower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly appears to hover above the pink flower, with no direct contact between its body and the flower's surface. This is consistent with Image A, where the butterfly is also not physically touching the flower. Therefore, in Image B, the butterfly is not in contact with the flower.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts multiple unopened pink flower buds surrounding the central pink flower, adding detail to the floral arrangement. This arrangement is similarly depicted in Image A. Therefore, in Image B, there are multiple unopened pink flower buds visible.",
