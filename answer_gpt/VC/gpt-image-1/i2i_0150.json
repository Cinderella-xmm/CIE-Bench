      "question": "Does the bird retain its bright yellow plumage with orange accents on its wings and tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird has a bright yellow plumage that covers its body. Upon examining the visible parts like the wings and tail, there are no discernible orange accents present in these areas. Instead, the bird's body consistently displays a vibrant yellow color. Hence, although the bird retains its bright yellow plumage, it lacks the specific orange accents asked about.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is shown sitting on a balcony railing. This position is consistent with a perching posture, as birds commonly use railings or branches to perch. This context suggests the bird is indeed perched.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
