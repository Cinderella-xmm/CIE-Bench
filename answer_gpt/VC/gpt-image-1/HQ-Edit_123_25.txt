    "Question": "Q1: Is the silver filigree hairpin shaped like a branching plant with delicate leaf-like extensions still present in the hair bun?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hairpin is represented by intricate embossing on the document in the center. It mimics the pattern seen in Image A, where the hairpin is distinctly placed in the hair bun. The pattern matches the branching design with leaf-like extensions seen in Image A, indicating that the hairpin is still present, though in a different form.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the symmetrical silver-threaded vine and leaf embroidery patterns clearly visible on the back of the teal garment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the document on the left showcases an embossed pattern matching the embroidery seen in Image A. This indicates that these patterns are represented and thus visible in a different context. In Image A, these patterns were visible as detailed vine and leaf embroidery on the garment.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are vertical green bamboo stalks visible in the background behind the subject?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not show a photographic background like Image A. Instead, Image B displays three embossed documents. The rightmost document has embossed bamboo patterns, similar to the bamboo stalks seen in Image A, but not as a background. Thus, while bamboo stalks are represented, they are not visible as a background.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the subjectâ€™s hair styled in a bun with loose tendrils framing the face and ear?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not feature a photographic subject, so there is no hair styled in the image. In Image A, the hair is styled in a bun with tendrils around the face and ear, but Image B shows embossed patterns without depicting any hairstyle.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the garment have a high collar and long sleeves with visible seam lines?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases embossed document designs without an image of the subject wearing a garment. While Image A shows a teal garment with a high collar, Image B does not display clothing or seam lines, focusing instead on embossed patterns.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the subject shown in a three-quarter rear view, facing toward the right side of the frame?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of a subject as seen in Image A. Image B focuses on embossed documents which do not include a person or orientation, unlike Image A where the subject's posture is a three-quarter rear view facing right.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is there a light blue ribbon tied in a bow at the waist of the garment?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not depict garments or accessories, unlike Image A where a ribbon is tied at the waist of the teal garment. The absence of this element in Image B leads to the conclusion that there is no ribbon or bow present.",
    "answer": "No"
