        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face in the edited image is blurred, making details like wrinkles and facial lines on the forehead and around the eyes indistinguishable and thus not verifiable.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the musician is holding a saxophone similarly, with his left hand on the keys, but due to the blurred area, it's unclear if the mouthpiece is exactly touching the musician's lips.",
