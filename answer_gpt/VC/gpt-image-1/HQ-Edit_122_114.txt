    "Question": "Q1: Is the window located at the top center of the house?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a window visibly placed at the top center of the house, aligned symmetrically with the roof structure. This design feature is identifiable by looking at the placement of the window within the house's triangle or gable peak. Typically, houses with such design elements place windows at the center for aesthetic symmetry, which is evident here.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the chimney positioned on the left side of the roof?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chimney is seen on the left side of the house from the viewerâ€™s perspective. This involves noting the orientation of the structure and identifying the vertical pipe extending upwards from the roof within the left portion of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the house have an A-frame roof with a pointed peak?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a structure with a distinct A-frame roof characterized by its sharp, triangular peak. Such roofs have a steeply sloped shape, creating a pointed peak at the top, which is clearly depicted in this image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a large circular opening in the front of the house where the nest is located?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, instead of a natural nest with a circular opening, the front is occupied by complex gears and mechanical elements integrated into the design. No natural circular opening for a nest is featured in the mechanical setup, distinguishing it from potential nest openings.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the stork located inside the nest?",
    "explanation": "Image B illustrates a mechanical representation of a stork amidst gears and pipes instead of a traditional nest. The stork-like figure is central to the house's mechanical aesthetics, but it is not positioned within a natural nest, but rather among cogs and metallic structures.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there yellow flowers and a path visible in the foreground?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground does not show any organic elements like yellow flowers or a path. Instead, the whole setting is mechanical with a focus on gears and pipes, lacking any natural scenery typically found in foregrounds with flowers or paths.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are green trees and a textured sky visible in the background?",
    "explanation": "The background of Image B is entirely focused on a mechanical or steampunk theme with gears and industrial design, lacking any natural elements like green trees or a sky. The setup prioritizes metallic elements over organic scenery.",
    "answer": "No"
