    "Question": "Q1: Is the vertical facial split between black and white fur still present, dividing the face precisely down the center?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine is rendered in a wooden material, showcasing a distinct two-tone pattern. The dog's face features a vertical division down the center, with a dark wood shade contrasting against a lighter wood shade, resembling the original black and white fur pattern. This technique achieves a similar visual effect of the split on Image A (chibi version). Based on common design practices in figurines, this recreates the appearance of the original facial split.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are both eyes large, round, and positioned symmetrically on either side of the facial split, with visible highlights reflecting light?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden figurine's eyes are large, round, and placed symmetrically on either side of the facial divide. The wood material and lighting create an effect that mimics light reflection highlights within the eyes, similar to the glassy eyes seen in Image A (chibi version). This maintains the symmetrical appearance and reflective light highlights characteristic.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the dog in an upright sitting position with both front paws flat on the ground and hind legs tucked beneath the body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden figurine portrays the dog sitting with an upright posture. Both front paws are shown flat on the wooden base, and the hind legs appear tucked beneath the body. This mirrors the position seen in Image A (chibi version) that displays the same upright sitting pose, reflecting a common depiction of a seated posture in small animal figurines.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are both ears pointed upward, erect, and symmetrical, with visible pink inner surfaces and dark outer edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ears of the wooden figurine are pointed and symmetrical, directed upwards. However, due to the material and color palette, there aren't distinct pink inner surfaces or dark outer edges. The natural wood tones do not provide the same color details as Image A (chibi version). Thus, the specific description of pink inner and dark outer cannot be confirmed.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the black nose centered on the white muzzle, with visible whisker lines extending from the sides of the snout?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden dog's nose is centered on its snout, crafted in a slightly darker wood tone to simulate the black color. However, due to the wooden medium, there are no visible whisker lines extending from the snout, unlike the drawn whisker lines in Image A (chibi version). The more stylized approach of the figurine doesn't include such details.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a collar visible around the dogâ€™s neck with at least one tag hanging from it?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden carving of the dog features a collar around its neck, which includes a tag. This reflects a similar accessory to the silver collar and tag seen in Image A (chibi version), designed to enhance the lifelike detail and suggest personalization often seen in pet figures and toys.",
    "answer": "Yes"
