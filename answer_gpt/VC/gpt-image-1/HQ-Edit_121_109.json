      "question": "Is the red hummingbird feeder with a transparent cylindrical reservoir and red base present in the same position and form as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hummingbird feeder has a transparent cylindrical reservoir and red base, similar to Image A. Its position on the right side of the image and form remain consistent with Image A. Both images depict the feeder hanging in the same location next to the house.",

      "question": "Is the thin vertical string suspending the hummingbird feeder visible and extending upward from the feederâ€™s top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a thin vertical string can be observed extending upwards from the top of the feeder, indicating it is suspended similarly to Image A. This supports the idea that the feeder is hanging as it does in Image A.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the circular wooden table is situated on the right side. There are cups and saucers on it, though it appears there are fewer items in Image B than in Image A. Image A displays four cups, while Image B presents three cups, suggesting a slight variation in arrangement.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the house on the right side is depicted, but it does not seem fully covered in green ivy. Image B indicates some foliage surrounding it, similar but fewer than the visible coverage in Image A, suggesting partial coverage.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a magical-looking hummingbird-like creature near the feeder, but instead of a direct, typical feeding approach as seen in Image A, the creature has a whimsical and fantastical appearance not precisely facing the feeder as the hummingbird in Image A does. Its positioning suggests a different narrative or artistic approach rather than realism.",
