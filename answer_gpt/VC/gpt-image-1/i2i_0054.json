      "question": "Is the detailed texture of the elephant's skin, showing wrinkles and creases, preserved in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible signs of elephant skin texture such as wrinkles or creases. Instead, the image displays a smooth, solid color without any detailed textural elements. This suggests that the detailed texture of the elephant's skin shown in Image A is not preserved in Image B. The subject in Image B appears to be a drawing of a banana on a stand with a smooth surface.",

      "question": "Is the elephant's posture, including the raised front leg and curved trunk, retained in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain at all an elephant, but rather a cartoonish representation of a banana hanging from a hook. There are no elements resembling elephant anatomy, such as legs or a trunk, and certainly no posture like the raised leg or curved trunk described. Therefore, none of the elephant's posture from Image A is retained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the elephant's ears and trunk, consistent with its young age, maintained in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is a banana with a stand and hook, which does not provide any visual cues related to elephant anatomy. There are no visible elements that could be interpreted as an elephant's ears or trunk. Therefore, the proportions consistent with a young elephant seen in Image A are not present in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the elephant positioned on the rock edge, with its legs and trunk maintaining their relative placement to the rock surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a banana hanging from a stand, and no elements resemble an elephant or a rock edge setting. The placement of the banana does not correlate with any scenarios involving animal anatomy and natural environments seen in Image A, so the positioning on the rock edge is not retained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the elephant face towards the right side of the image, preserving its profile orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject in Image B is facing to the left and does not resemble an elephant at all. It is a drawing of a banana hanging on a stand. The direction or profile orientation of an elephant facing right, as seen in Image A, is not present in Image B.",
