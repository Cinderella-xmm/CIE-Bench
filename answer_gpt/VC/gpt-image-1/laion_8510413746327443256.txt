    "Question": "Q1: Is the display of the device rectangular with rounded corners?",
    "explanation": "The second image features a dragon, not a device like a watch. The visual information reveals a serpentine creature adorned with luminescent accents. This depiction, in terms of shape and structural features, lacks any rectangular form with rounded corners resembling a device such as a watch. Therefore, based on Image B, the display is not rectangular with rounded corners.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the digital crown positioned on the right side of the watch case?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the digital crown, a common watch feature, is not present. The dragon in the image does not have elements analogous to a watch case or a digital crown. By assessing Image B independently, it shows an artistic representation of a dragon with glowing motifs rather than functional watch components.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a small button located below the digital crown on the right side of the case?",
    "explanation": "From visual cues in Image B, there is neither a digital crown nor a button below it; Image B is a fantasy illustration of a dragon. This lacks structural similarities or components like buttons that you would expect in a watch, suggesting that no button arrangement akin to watches is present.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the ends of the band attached to the left and right sides of the watch case?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not depict a watch design. It's an imaginative illustration of a dragon, not featuring any bands or attachments that align with a watch case structure. Therefore, the concept of a band attached to the sides of a case does not apply to Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the screen facing directly forward, perpendicular to the wrist?",
    "explanation": "The second image represents a dragon. It does not include a screen or wrist-oriented elements similar to a watch. Hence, there is no screen orientation depicted in Image B to evaluate using characteristics like forward direction or perpendicularity to the wrist.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the watch case have a slim, compact profile with minimal depth?",
    "explanation": "Image B entirely revolves around a dragon representation, absent of any watch case. This fantastical portrayal concentrates on the creature's intricate form, offering no design clues about a watch's profile or depth, affirming the exclusions of compact design attributes synonymous with watch cases.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are there multiple adjustment holes along the length of the band?",
    "explanation": "There is no band or strap depicted in Image B as it is an illustration of a dragon. Therefore, it lacks adjustment holes like those found in wearable accessories, specifically watch bands.",
    "answer": "No"
