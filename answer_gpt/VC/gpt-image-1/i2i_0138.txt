    "Question": "Q1: Are the silver blades still visibly reflective?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scissor blades appear to retain a certain degree of sheen, indicative of reflectiveness. This visual cue, combined with world knowledge about metal surfaces, suggests that such materials typically maintain a reflective quality unless explicitly altered to look otherwise. The texture in Image B seems to mimic the reflective appearance of metal.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the golden handles still show a polished finish?",
    "explanation": "Image B's handles, represented in a chalk-style drawing, maintain a golden appearance. While chalk and sketch visuals typically do not convey the gleam of polished metal, the emphasis on the color and form implies that the polished nature of the handles is visually suggested, albeit in a stylized manner.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the open V-shape configuration of the blades preserved?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the blades are arranged in an open V-shape configuration similar to what is often seen with scissors prepared for cutting. This configuration is visually distinct and mirrors common configurations of scissors, indicating little to no change from such a standard depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the background still a uniform dark gray?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background has been altered to resemble a textured chalkboard with visible lines and a less uniform appearance. While still dark, it contains additional visual elements compared to a plain, uniform dark gray surface.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the edges of the blades still clean and sharp?",
    "explanation": "Image B, despite being stylized, suggests the sharpness of the blades through distinct, clean lines drawn to represent the scissor edges. The term 'sharp' is even emphasized in the image, suggesting that the representation aims to maintain the perception of sharp, clean blade edges, similar to real scissors.",
    "answer": "Yes"
