      "question": "Is the ALSC logo present in the bottom right corner with the blue \"ALSC\" text, the integrated black checkmark, and the full name \"AUTHENTICATION LEGALIZATION SERVICES CANADA\" in black capital letters below it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, I can observe a logo located in the bottom right corner that includes the blue text 'ALSC'. It also features a black checkmark, which is consistent with the description. Below it, the full name 'AUTHENTICATION LEGES GATION SERVICES.CANADA' is present in black capital letters, although the wording differs slightly from the expected text. Despite the difference in wording, the presence of both the blue 'ALSC' text and the black checkmark in the bottom right corner confirms the essential features of the logo.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there exactly five orange circular markers positioned along the black checkmark pathway, each containing a white icon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are circular orange markers; however, they are not positioned along a black checkmark pathway but rather interlaced within a maze-like structure. While there are multiple orange circles present, they donâ€™t align with a pathway structure as described. The arrangement and the number of circles do not match the description of having exactly five along a specific pathway.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the icon in the first orange circle (bottom-left) a white magnifying glass over a document?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the icon in the bottom-left orange circle is not a magnifying glass over a document. Instead, it appears to be related to approval, featuring the text 'APPROVED'. This symbolizes a different concept than the magnifying glass and document icon described, indicating that they do not match.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text associated with the first orange circle says 'You choose how fast', which does not match with 'We verify your Document'. Image B clearly demonstrates different textual descriptions than what is being asked.",

      "question": "Are there five blue dots placed along the black checkmark pathway, one between each pair of adjacent orange circles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the layout includes interconnected pathways with three colors, but it does not feature five blue dots placed along any pathways. Instead, the pathways are entwined with colored lines. Therefore, the specific arrangement of five blue dots along a pathway is absent.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the top, the title 'ALSC 5 Easy Steps' is clearly displayed in bold blue font. Below it, the subtitle 'For documents to be used in Qatar' is present in a smaller blue font. This matches the description provided, affirming that both text sections indeed appear as outlined.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the background is not plain white, as it contains a complex maze-like pattern formed by intertwined red and black lines. This presence of a graphic element in the background indicates that the image does not have a plain white background free of textures or colors.",
