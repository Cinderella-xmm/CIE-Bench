      "question": "Does the parking meter maintain its black cylindrical shape and color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both parking meters are still black and appear to be cylindrical, consistent with typical parking meter design. Common knowledge indicates parking meters are often cylindrical and black in color, which is evident in both images. Therefore, the shape and color are maintained in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the coin slot visible on both parking meters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, both parking meters have a visible coin slot as evidenced by the circular openings with metallic key inserts. Typically, the coin slots are found towards the bottom of parking meters, and in Image B, they are clearly visible in that position.",

      "question": "Is the digital display on the right parking meter unchanged and labeled \"1995\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the digital display on the right parking meter does show the number '1995', which matches the common visual indicator for year or fee-related numbers on parking meters. Comparatively, in Image A, the parking meter also displays '1995' prominently. Hence, the display remains unchanged regarding the number shown.",

      "question": "Is the scene background, including the sidewalk, street, cars, and buildings, consistent with the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B and Image A both present similar backgrounds composed of a street view with cars, sidewalk, and buildings. From the analysis, nothing has been altered significantly in the background between the two images, suggesting consistency in the scene's elements. World knowledge about typical urban settings with consistent architectural styles also supports this assessment.",

      "question": "Are the numbers on the left meter (\"20487\") still present in some form, like being part of the robotic dog's design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left parking meter shows the numbers '34887' without incorporating '20487', as evidenced by the clear and visible digital display labeled as '34887'. This differs from Image A where '34887' is prominently shown on the left meter; no part of Image B's decoration with the robotic dog incorporates the numbers '20487'.",
