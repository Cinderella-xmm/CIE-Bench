      "question": "Are the four minarets positioned symmetrically—two on the left and two on the right—relative to the central dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which appears to be an imaginative and fantastical representation of a structure, the four elements resembling minarets are not positioned symmetrically in the traditional manner around the central dome. These structures are instead used as legs or supports for the fantasy construct, which differs greatly from real architectural features. This lack of traditional symmetry in placement suggests that the minarets are not symmetrically positioned in a realistic manner, as one would expect in an actual building.",

      "question": "Is the 15 July Martyrs Bridge clearly visible in the background, crossing the water behind the Hagia Sophia?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is a surreal representation featuring a fantastical structure and an outer space theme, with no visible elements related to a real cityscape, such as the 15 July Martyrs Bridge. There is no visible bridge or realistic background setting; instead, the background is a starry or cosmic sky, which would not include earthly structures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is a large body of water visible behind the Hagia Sophia, extending toward the horizon with boats on its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a creative, fantasy interpretation, lacking any realistic depiction of natural Earth elements such as bodies of water. The background of the picture consists of a cosmic sky without any water features or boats. The fantastical and stylized nature of the image excludes depictions of Earth-like scenes.",

      "question": "Are green trees visible in the foreground, partially obscuring the base of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the imaginative structure depicted in Image B, there are no natural elements such as green trees. The focus is on the otherworldly architecture and cosmic environment, and the concept of foreground with trees partially obscuring the structure doesn't apply to this fantastical interpretation.",

      "question": "Are multiple arched windows visible on the front-facing wall beneath the central dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fantastical structure in Image B does not adhere to typical architectural features like arched windows beneath a central dome. Instead, the structure is heavily stylized, focusing more on ornate and complex designs rather than practical elements like windows.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Are several smaller domes visible around the base of the central dome, forming a tiered roofline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does feature smaller domes surrounding the central dome. These domes contribute to the overall ornate and imaginative architecture reminiscent of a tiered design, albeit in a supernatural and artistic interpretation rather than a practical one.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background does not depict a clear, light blue sky typically symbolizing daytime. Instead, it shows a cosmic or space-like environment with dark, starry elements. This creative backdrop is indicative of a stylized and imaginative atmosphere rather than a natural daytime sky.",
