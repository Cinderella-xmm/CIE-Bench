      "question": "Does the atomic design retain the three intersecting elliptical orbits with a central nucleus and three electron positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see a schematic illustration of an atom with three intersecting elliptical orbits centered around a nucleus. The illustration labels parts of the atom, including 'electron', 'proton', and 'neutron', clearly indicating the structure of these components. This is consistent with the general depiction of atoms in scientific diagrams, where electrons typically orbit the nucleus along ellipses or circles. The description given confirms that this design maintains the structure of three elliptical orbits.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the white plastic cookie cutter retaining its original atomic-shaped outline with three elliptical loops and a central nucleus?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cookie cutter is shown maintaining its distinctive atomic design, featuring three elliptical loops crossing at a central point. It visually matches the typical representation of an atomic structure with loops symbolizing electron paths. The cookie cutter appears unchanged in shape and maintains the same atomic design as would be seen in Image A, suggesting consistency in its structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cookie cutter positioned to the left of the atomic imprint, with a partial edge overlap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible cookie cutter with an atomic imprint and partial edge overlap. Instead, the cookie cutter is depicted on the left side of a labeled atomic graphic. Without Image A's context, Image B does not show an imprint on dough or overlap, but rather positions the cutter next to the illustration for descriptive purposes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the atomic imprint in the dough have clean, continuous edges without breaks or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a dough imprint; it shows an atomic illustration adjacent to a cookie cutter meant for educational description. The illustration provides a clean and clear depiction of an atom without any breaks or distortions, suitable for the educational theme of 'Atoms & Cookies.' Because there is no impression on dough in Image B, there can be no assessment of imprint continuity or cleanness typically associated with dough shaping.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a small central hole in the nucleus area of the atomic imprint?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain a dough imprint, but rather an illustrated atom next to the cookie cutter. It focuses on labeling components such as electrons, protons, and neutrons without an imprint context. As there is no depiction involving dough, the presence or absence of a hole must be assessed based on Image A, where such a hole may have been observed. Hence, Image B does not support any notion of a central hole in an imprint.",
