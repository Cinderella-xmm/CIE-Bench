      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'DUCATI' text is prominent in white lettering across the down tube, which is evident from its contrast against the red background. World knowledge indicates that branding is commonly placed on the down tube to ensure visibility.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no indication of any text on the seat stay, as the focus is on the character and the main frame. The seat stay appears plain, with no visible 'DUCATI' logo or text. Common design practices usually prioritize branding on more visible parts of the frame.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the saddle and handlebars appear to blend with the character and frame in a stylized manner, making it less distinct, but they appear visually consistent with black. These components are traditionally black, blending with different color frames.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tires don't show a silver reflective stripe on the sidewall. The focus is more on the vibrant and exaggerated motion of the character and frame, typical of cartoon illustrations where certain details are omitted for emphasis.",

        "No"
      ],

      "explanation": "In Image B, the wheel hubs are not distinctly visible. The central portions of the wheels are obscured by the exaggerated comic style and character design, often diverting focus from mechanical details.",
