      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a visible red flower-like motif present in the central area of the transformed object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central area of the transformed object prominently features a phoenix design rather than specific flower motifs. Although there are red, floral-like elements as part of the phoenix's plumage, they play a secondary role to the phoenix itself. The red flower-like motifs are integrated into the overall design rather than standing alone as central motifs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a continuous blue geometric pattern forming a border near the upper edge of the transformed object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) displays an intricate decorative design featuring blue as one of the main colors. However, the design focus is on the intricate ornate pattern and phoenix imagery and not on a continuous blue geometric border near the upper edge. The design emphasis appears more organic and integrated rather than strictly geometric and bordered.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there green leaf-like shapes integrated into the surface design of the transformed object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the phoenix's feathers and the comprehensive patterning show a range of colors, including blue and red, but there are indeed green leaf-like shapes embedded in the decorative foliage of the design, contributing to the detailed artistic work.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the patterns outlined in black to define individual elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's design involves rich and intricate detailing with vibrant colors. Nevertheless, the patterns or individual elements are not specifically outlined in black. The contours are defined through color variation and blending, typical of artistic illustrations, rather than using black outlines.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the pattern arrangement radially symmetric around the center of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pattern in Image B, while highly detailed and symmetrical in some features, centers more around the phoenix motif rather than having a strict radial symmetry centered around the entire object. The symmetry is more thematic rather than strictly geometric or perfectly radial.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors blue, red, green, and black used throughout the design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in Image B prominently features blue, red, and green as dominant colors, used throughout the object's surface design. However, black does not play as significant a role; it is not a dominant defining color in this context.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the transformed cup (now phoenix egg) positioned within or upon the transformed saucer (now nest)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object has been transformed creatively from a cup and saucer into a phoenix egg resting upon an ornate, dish-like nest, maintaining a similar spatial relationship as in the original context but within the transformed theme.",
