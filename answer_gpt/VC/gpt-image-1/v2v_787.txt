    "Question": "Q1: Are the eyes almond-shaped and positioned symmetrically on the face?",
    "explanation": "Image B represents a stylized chibi illustration where facial features are typically simplified. The face is blurred, making it impossible to identify or assess the shape and symmetry of the eyes. Therefore, under the circumstances where specific details cannot be discerned, the answer defaults to 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are there small gold hoop earrings present in both ears?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the character is simplified to chibi form and depicts accessories like earrings. Given that the earrings in Image B resemble simple hoops and appear to be gold in color, and knowing the stylized approach usually maintains symmetry for accessories, it is reasonable to deduce that there are small gold hoop earrings in both ears.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the right hand placed inside the front pocket of the trousers with fingers visible?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character's styling is cartoonish where one hand holds an object and the other is doing something different. The right hand is prominent, holding an object and not inside any pocket, thus implying the answer is 'No' as the hand placement does not match the description provided.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the hair have a natural, wavy curl pattern falling over the shoulders?",
    "explanation": "Image B retains the stylized hair pattern characteristic of illustrations, where the hair is indeed depicted as having natural, wavy curls that extend to the shoulders. This portrayal corresponds with how wavy hair is conventionally represented in compact cartoon formats.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the head slightly tilted forward toward the camera?",
    "explanation": "The head position in Image B, given the chibi representation where proportions and perspectives are exaggerated or simplified, does not distinctly suggest a forward tilt toward the viewer. It appears to be in an upright stance typical of stylized illustrations.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the blouse have a V-neckline with visible buttons running down the center?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the blouse is depicted with a collar and buttons centrally placed, consistent with a V-neck design, which is characteristic of many open-collared garments even within abstract or cartoon representations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do the trousers have a high waist with a visible waistband seam and belt loops?",
    "explanation": "Image B, although chibi-stylized, shows trousers with discernable high waist design attributes including a waistband with belt loops. These features align with real-world trouser design elements often illustrated simply but clearly in chibi style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
