        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a handheld fan with a circular blade structure visible in the man's right hand, which is directed toward the cake.

      "question": "Are there exactly seven candles on the cake, with visible flames and smoke rising from them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake clearly shows seven candles placed on top, each with a distinct flame visible. This aligns with the traditional appearance of lit birthday candles, where flames indicate they are lit, and there are wisps of smoke visible above them, suggesting some have been recently extinguished.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is smoke visibly rising from the candles on the cake. This is a typical feature after candles have been blown out or are in the process of being extinguished, indicating activity related to birthday traditions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration style does not depict the man's mouth puckered or him leaning forward in a position that suggests blowing air toward the cake. Instead, his posture seems relaxed without any clear indication of blowing.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake is indeed illustrated on a white plate. While the wooden surface is not explicitly detailed, the context of the scene suggests that the plate rests on a flat surface typical of a wooden tabletop found in similar settings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handheld fan is positioned in the man’s right hand near the cake, with the fan blades facing towards the candles on the cake. This placement suggests that any airflow would be directed towards the candles, which could correlate with the goal of blowing them out.",
