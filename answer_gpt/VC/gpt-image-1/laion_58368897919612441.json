      "question": "Are both corner towers with domed roofs and weather vanes present and positioned at the upper corners of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two prominent corner towers, each equipped with a domed roof and a weather vane. These towers are positioned at the upper corners of the central structure beneath the glass dome. From visual cues and knowledge of architecture, these towers serve aesthetic functions and typically signify robustness and prominence in design. The presence and positioning are typical and intact, similar to such historical constructions.",

      "question": "Is the crenellated parapet running along the top edge of the tower intact and continuous?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a continuous crenellated parapet running along the top edge of the tower. Crenellations are characteristic features of medieval structures, providing both decorative and defensive elements. In this particular representation, the parapet forms a complete and unbroken line along the structure's edge.",

      "question": "Are the arched windows arranged symmetrically across the façade, including the triplet groupings above the main level?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the façade displays arched windows arranged symmetrically. The triplet windows above the main entrance level are evenly spaced and aligned, which is typical of symmetrical window design using common aesthetic principles in architecture for balanced appearance.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a central arched entrance at ground level, directly beneath the central section of the façade, with a wooden drawbridge structure extending forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower features a central arched entrance at ground level beneath the central section of the façade. The structure includes a wooden drawbridge-like extension, fitting the description with a pathway leading away from the entrance. Drawbridges are traditional in castles, creating an entranceway that is notable and functional.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there horizontal bands of alternating light and dark stone visible across the exterior walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the exterior walls of the tower do not exhibit horizontal bands of alternating light and dark stone. The stonework appears uniformly colored, typical of small-scale representations where omitting complex stonework patterns may simplify design for clarity while maintaining general historic integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the tower maintain a tall, rectangular mass with two prominent corner towers projecting outward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the architectural form of a tall, rectangular mass with two prominent corner towers projecting outward. This is a common structural design element in medieval towers, adding both aesthetic appeal and structural integrity with projections forming a key component of the tower's identity.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the wooden drawbridge constructed with a crisscross lattice pattern of beams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden drawbridge structure does not exhibit a crisscross lattice pattern of beams. Instead, it is represented in a simplified form without visible intricate beam patterns. This simplification might be due to considerations in miniature artistic representations retaining broader architectural features without detailed structural complexities.",
