    "Question": "Q1: Is the mountain depicted as a symmetrical, perfectly conical shape with a pointed peak?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain is contained within a glass dome, resembling a conically shaped peak with snow on top, reflecting a symmetrical and perfectly conical form. Given that it is designed as a miniature representation, common sense suggests it portrays an idealized version of a mountain, typically with such symmetry and pointedness.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the summit of the mountain have a continuous white snow cap covering the top?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a miniature mountain inside a dome with the summit capped in white. This resembles continuous snow coverage. Such a design indicates a simplified but comprehensive representation of snow-capped peaks.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a clear, mirror-like reflection of the mountain in the lake below?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the representation of the mountain includes a reflection in the water beneath it. The precision of this design suggests a mirror-like reflection is intended, as it aligns with the artistic representation commonly used in glass domes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there small structures or buildings positioned along the edge of the lake, between the water and the mountain base?",
    "explanation": "There are small structures visible in the edited image, positioned along the lake just above its edge. This placement reflects common placements seen in real-world landscapes around mountains, fitting within the style of such miniature designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the sky visible above the mountain, appearing as a solid or gradient blue area?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background setting appears to have the mountain placed within a dome without visible sky above it. The visual design confines the mountain, thereby omitting any view of the sky that would usually be depicted in landscape scenarios of mountains.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there visible layers on the mountainâ€™s slopes, showing a transition from white snow at the top to darker rock and then to green/brown vegetation below?",
    "explanation": "The mountain in Image B transitions visibly from the snow-covered peak to green vegetation below, without visible rock layers between. Common representations in miniature or artistic versions often skip rocky layers for simplicity, focusing instead on clear vegetation transitions.",
    "answer": "No"
