        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the calendar illustration shows the scientist using her right hand to hold a pipette or similar instrument, angled toward the test tubes, consistent with typical imagery of laboratory work where such instruments are frequently used to handle liquids in test tubes.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration includes racks of test tubes where the liquid appears in a color that can be interpreted as teal or greenish-blue according to the artistic style, suggesting the depiction of a laboratory setting with chemical substances.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Image B illustration uses artistic representation to color the liquid in the test tubes in shades resembling teal or greenish-blue, consistent with colors commonly used to portray chemicals.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the scientist positioned in front of the test tubes, with the microscope to her right and digital screens behind her?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B places the scientist in front of the test tubes, but does not show a microscope to her right. Instead, digital screens are illustrated behind her, capturing a laboratory setting but with some layout modifications compared to typical real-life setups.",
