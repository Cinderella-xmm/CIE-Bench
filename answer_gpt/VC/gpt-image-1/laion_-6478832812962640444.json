      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the toe box of the boot rounded?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toe box of the boot has a flat, angular shape with clean lines, suggesting a squared design typical of more modern or stylized footwear, rather than the traditional rounded shape often associated with classic boots. Based on this observation, the toe box is not rounded.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the boot shaft is indeed V-shaped, marked by a prominent angled cut that creates a symmetrical point. This design choice is often seen in cowboy boots to facilitate ease of entry and add to the stylistic flair.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible white piping along the outer side of the shaft. The boot has a metallic, monochromatic finish with intricate pattern designs, but lacks any contrasting vertical stripes or piping.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a boot that features intricate geometric patterns which appear like engraving or embossing. These patterns cover both the upper shaft and the vamp area. This is a consistent design approach where the shaft and vamp are adorned with similar styled motifs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boot features a clearly defined heel block, consistent with the structure of many boots which often incorporate a raised heel for aesthetic and functional purposes. This heel elevates the rear part of the boot, visible by its prominent cuboid shape.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
