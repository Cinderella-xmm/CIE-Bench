        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child retains the same pose and orientation as that depicted in Image A, which is characterized by an outstretched arm reaching towards the heart-shaped balloon. The figure appears similar in structure and silhouette to its original design.",

        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B feature a prominently displayed round red balloon positioned directly above the child's head. Its shape remains an unchanged circular form, distinct from its background elements, confirming its retention.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the heart-shaped balloon is preserved and still depicted above the child's outstretched arm in its distinct heart form. The balloon's position in relation to the child's gesture in Image B aligns closely with that in Image A.",

        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child's posture with an outstretched arm indicates that the figure is reaching towards the heart-shaped balloon. This same reaching gesture is evident in Image A, further confirming the action portrayed remains consistent.",

        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Comparison between Image A and Image B reveals that the spatial relationship among the child, the round balloon above, and the heart-shaped balloon to the right remains unchanged, ensuring that their positions relative to one another are consistent.",
