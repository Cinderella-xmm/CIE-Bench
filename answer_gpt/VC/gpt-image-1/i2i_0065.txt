    "Question": "Q5: Do the dog's eyes retain their reflective quality in the edited image?",

Animals, particularly mammals like dogs, often have eyes that catch and reflect light, giving a shiny appearance. This is usually especially visible in photography due to the illumination used during a shot, showcasing the reflective and expressive nature of the dog's eyes.",
