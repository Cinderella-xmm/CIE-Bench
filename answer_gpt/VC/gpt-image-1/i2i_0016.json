      "question": "Do both players retain identifiable clothing (white shirts and shorts, white tank top with black bottoms) and hairstyles in the chibi version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi rendition of the players still features identifiable clothing that closely matches the original. Both are in tennis attire with one character in a white shirt and dark shorts, and the other in a white tank top with a dark skirt. Their hairstyles also resemble the original image, with one player having a ponytail and the other wearing a cap. This shows that the main elements of their attire and hairstyles have been translated into the chibi style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both players still holding tennis rackets in the chibi rendition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two chibi characters are clearly illustrated holding tennis rackets of distinct colors. The rackets are a significant part of their interaction, maintaining the essence of a tennis match. The inclusion of the rackets is in keeping with the original intention of indicating a tennis setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the handshake pose still maintained between the two chibi players over the net?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi version in Image B illustrates the two characters engaging in a handshake, designed similarly to their real-life counterparts in Image A. This handshake occurs over the net, suggesting a sportsmanship gesture typical in tennis and preserving the original image's key interaction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are tennis balls and the net still present in the foreground and middle ground respectively?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on the chibi characters and their interaction rather than the surrounding environment, typically seen in cartoonish renderings. The illustration emphasizes the handshake without specific elements like tennis balls or a visible tennis net in the same manner as seen in Image A, focusing instead on the characters.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the background still depict an outdoor tennis court or at least retain visual hints of it (e.g., court lines, fencing)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a stylized, simplified backdrop with the suggestion of a tennis court in the image's composition. The subtle court lines in the background, although cartoonishly abstracted, provide hints of a tennis context even if not as explicitly detailed as in Image A.",
