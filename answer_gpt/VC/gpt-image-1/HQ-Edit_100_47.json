      "question": "Is the Eiffel Tower depicted with its characteristic lattice iron framework, including the four arched legs and tapered spire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower is presented in the style of paper art, where the structure displays its defining lattice iron framework typically associated with the real Eiffel Tower's architecture, including the four arched legs and a tapered spire. From visual observation in Image B, it is clear that the paper art maintains these iconic features, demonstrating the Eiffel Tower's recognizable design.",

      "question": "Is the rectangular reflecting pool positioned directly in front of the Eiffel Tower, aligned along the central axis of the composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the reflecting pool is distinctly positioned directly in front of the Eiffel Tower, along the central axis of the composition, akin to traditional Parisian urban planning, where the alignment emphasizes symmetry and balance in architectural layouts.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the pathways and tree arrangements in the foreground arranged symmetrically around the central axis leading to the Eiffel Tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates symmetry in its composition, with pathways and tree arrangements clearly flanking the central axis that leads to the Eiffel Tower. The landscape design reflects the formal gardening style commonly found in European urban settings, which is designed to guide the observer's perspective towards a central focal point.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a spire-shaped building is discernible in the background to the left of the Eiffel Tower. This element is a common feature in cityscapes, where historical or iconic structures are often included to contribute to the skyline, offering a sense of place and architectural diversity.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sun is depicted symbolically as a paper art cutout placed in the upper-left portion of the frame, with rays extending outward, suggesting light emanating from that direction. This placement influences how shadows and highlights are rendered within the composition, indicating the light source's direction.",
