      "question": "Do the nesting dolls maintain a triangular shape inspired by the pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features nesting dolls that are designed with a triangular element at the top, reminiscent of a pointed or triangular head, which directly reflects the shape of the pyramid seen in Image A. The triangular aspect of the pyramid is very evident in these doll designs, as they imitate the sloping sides of a pyramid by having a pointed top.",

      "question": "Do the nesting dolls retain the stone texture seen in the original pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Nesting dolls in Image B have a patterned texture that visually aims to replicate the brick or stone facade seen on the original pyramid in Image A. While the material of the dolls is not stone (likely wood or similar), the painted design mimics the stonework of the pyramid through a similar block design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the nesting dolls designed with a symmetrical structure similar to the original pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each nesting doll is designed to be symmetrical, as shown by their even proportions and the centered triangular features, similar to the symmetrical structure of the pyramid in Image A, where both sides mirror each other.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the nesting dolls arranged in descending size order on the wooden table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the nesting dolls placed on a wooden table, organized from largest to smallest, demonstrating a clear descending order in size, which can be easily identified through visual observation of the placement from left to right.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the largest nesting doll and possibly others incorporate a design element resembling the pyramid's central entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The largest nesting doll in Image B, along with the others, features a triangular pattern adjacent to the face, which can be seen as symbolizing the pyramid's central entrance depicted in Image A. This pattern reflects the entrance's triangular top seen in the pyramid structure.",
