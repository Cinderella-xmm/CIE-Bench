      "question": "Is the subject’s beard and mustache present and white in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image shows a beard and mustache that are present and appear white in color. This is consistent with the visual cues such as the style of illustration depicting aged features commonly indicating a white beard. Therefore, this conclusion is drawn based on these visual cues combined with common knowledge about appearance illustration techniques.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the subject have short, graying white hair with a visible receding hairline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the subject with short, graying white hair and a visible receding hairline. This is apparent from the hair's length, color, and style, which are typical features used in illustrations to convey age progression. These observations suggest that the hair is short and contains gray and white tones, indicating aging.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the subject’s mouth slightly open, indicating speech?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since the facial region in Image B is blurred, it does not provide clarity on the status of the mouth using visible cues. Therefore, it is impossible to confirm any indication of speech based on obscure illustration shadows.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the subject wearing a dark suit jacket over a white dress shirt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays a subject wearing a dark suit jacket coupled with a white dress shirt. The distinct visual representation and color contrast convey the dark jacket paired with a white shirt, commonly associated with formal attire.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a tie visible at the neck, knotted in standard fashion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a formal tie, with distinct visual cues indicating its presence around the neck and knotted in a conventional fashion. The representation of these typical features in formal illustrations confirms the tie's standard appearance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the subject’s eyes positioned symmetrically, with visible wrinkles around them, and a prominent nose and jawline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial details are obscured, preventing observation of symmetrical eye positions, wrinkles, or other facial features like the nose and jawline. The general illustration might imply these characteristics, but the blur specifically renders them indeterminate.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the face illuminated from the front-right, casting subtle shadows on the left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B suggests the presence of subtle lighting effects, the blur makes it challenging to confirm precise lighting direction and shadow casting. Without distinct visual evidence, shadows and light source specifics are difficult to ascertain.",
