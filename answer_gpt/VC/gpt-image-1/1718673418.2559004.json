      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the elevated rocky outcrop forming the base of the island still present with its original silhouette and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene depicts an imaginative setting characterized by giant mushrooms with houses sheltered beneath them. This fantastical depiction lacks any rocky outcrop or traditional island base that would be normal in a terrestrial environment. Given these visual cues and understanding of fantastical art, the original silhouette and base of the island are absent.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the houses arranged in a dense, tiered cluster ascending the slope of the island?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents houses clustered around and underneath large mushroom caps, not ascending on slopes as expected in a natural environment. These visual elements suggest that the houses are nestled together but are more integrated with the mushrooms than arranged in a tiered manner that ascends slopes.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a visible road that connects the dock to the main cluster of houses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible dock or terrestrial roads typical for a picturesque village setting. Instead, the scene portrays fantastical pathways within clouds, lacking conventional roads and docks.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a wooden dock structure extending from the island into the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a whimsical setting without any indications of a wooden dock structure extending into water. The constructs seen are ethereal, floating components rather than physical docks.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is dominated by large mushrooms and wispy clouds, with no presence of trees visible in the foreground on either side. These fanciful elements substitute natural trees.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there large mountain peaks visible in the background behind the island?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a dreamy background with large vertical elements that resemble mushroom stalks or whimsical structures rather than recognizable mountain peaks. This setting lacks conventional mountainous terrain typically seen in natural environments.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the sunlight come from the upper left, casting shadows toward the lower right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, primarily featuring ethereal lighting conditions characteristic of a fantasy scene with soft hues and cloud-like surroundings, does not demonstrate clear directional sunlight casting shadows in a defined manner. The lighting integrates into the whimsical setting without specific shadow directionality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings are topped with mushroom caps and vine-like growths enveloped in greens and pinks, deviating from traditional architecture with red-tiled roofs and earthy walls seen in practical settings. These features emphasize a surreal aesthetic rather than conventional building styles.",
