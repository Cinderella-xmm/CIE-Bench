    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the circular orb-web with clearly defined radial and concentric threads still present and structurally intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the web structure is only partially visible and appears to be disrupted by the presence of the large winged creature in front of it. The original orb-web in Image A had a clear and intact circular structure with defined threads, but Image B has the web as partially obscured and lacking the full circular integrity. This indicates the web is not structurally intact in its original form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the branches positioned in a natural arc around the web, supporting it from multiple directions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the branches still appear to be positioned naturally and arc around the web area, similar to Image A. They still serve the purpose of supporting a web that is positioned among them, despite the distortions caused by the central creature.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the leaves retain their oval shape, visible venation, and glossy surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves continue to exhibit their oval shape and maintain some visible venation. The glossy surface texture is less apparent due to the change in overall lighting and focus, but the basic shape and venation are still discernible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there small, clear water droplets visible on the surfaces of some leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible small, clear water droplets on the leaf surfaces. The focus appears to have shifted to other aspects of the image, such as the creature's intricate details, and any droplets that may have been present in Image A are not evident here.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background a soft, uniform pale blue-gray sky without additional elements such as clouds or sun?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background remains a pale blue-gray in color as in Image A. The focus shift to the central creature does not introduce any additional elements like clouds or the sun, so the background retains its uniform nature.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the webâ€™s radial threads visibly connected to the branch ends at multiple points?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of the large creature and the altered visual focus obscure the view of the web's connection to the branches. Unlike Image A, where these connections were clearly depicted, Image B does not clearly show these connections, making it uncertain if the radial threads are visibly connected at multiple points.",
