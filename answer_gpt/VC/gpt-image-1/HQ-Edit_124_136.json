    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the figure seated in a cross-legged position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is seated in a position that appears more formal, as typically depicted in historical or religious illustrations. The depiction suggests a traditional sitting pose, not necessarily cross-legged, supported by the presence of the stone seat.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the right hand positioned above the strings in a plucking gesture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right hand of the figure is positioned to indicate a grasp on the lyre, which suggests it may be used to strum or pluck the strings, aligning with the common gesture used in playing string instruments.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the left hand positioned on the neck of the instrument with fingers pressing the strings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left hand of the figure is shown holding the body of the lyre, not the neck, as the lyre does not feature a neck to press strings against like other string instruments such as a guitar or lute.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the figure facing forward with the head slightly tilted upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the blurred face, the orientation is subtly suggested by the positioning of the shoulders and the angle of the hood, indicating a largely forward-facing position without any discernible tilt.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the figure have a long, flowing white beard and mustache?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is indeed depicted with a long, flowing white beard, which extends over the chest area. This visual cue is common in historical or religious representations of learned or wise figures.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the figure wearing a brown, textured turban?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is wearing a hooded robe that covers the head, rather than a turban, which is consistent with imagery of monastic or religious figures in historical depictions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a visible soundboard area on the instrument?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lyre, featured in the hands of the figure, does not have a distinct soundboard area like string instruments such as a guitar or lute. The structure of the lyre is different, focusing more on the framework than on a soundboard.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
