      "question": "Is the ornate bow featuring symmetrical scrollwork and multiple spherical finials present and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bow shows symmetrical scrollwork and spherical finials, characteristics of ornate design. The scrolls appear balanced on either side of a central axis, typical of symmetrical aesthetics. Comparison with Image A reveals that these design elements remain unchanged, as both images consistently depict the same ornate structures.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the double-notched bit at the end of the key preserved in its original H-shaped configuration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a double-notched bit that resembles an 'H' shape, a feature easy to identify due to its distinct geometric form. Comparing with Image A shows consistency, as both images display the same H-shaped notch configuration at the key's end.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the textured bands along the shaft preserved in their original placement and form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, textured bands are visible along the shaft, arranged in segments that resemble traditional ornamentation on antique keys. These bands appear to be consistently placed relative to each other, providing visual continuity. Image A shows identical band placement and form, proving they remain unchanged in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the key rendered in the original aged golden brass tone with visible highlights and shadows indicating metallic texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the key in a golden brass tone, characteristic of aged materials, and reveals highlights and shadows that convey metallic textureâ€”indicating light interaction typical of such surfaces. Comparing Image A, the same aged golden brass tone and similar lighting effects are observed, showing they are preserved in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the spherical finials positioned symmetrically around the scrollwork in the bow as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bow in Image B shows spherical finials, positioned symmetrically around scrollwork, enhancing the overall design and balance. Examining Image A confirms these finials maintain similar symmetry and position, indicating no alteration in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the key proportionally accurate, with the bow, shaft, and bit maintaining their original relative dimensions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a proportionately accurate key structure, where the dimensions of the bow, shaft, and bit align logically, ensuring functional and aesthetic harmony. Upon comparison, Image A shows identical proportions, demonstrating that the key's size and relative dimensions are preserved in Image B.",
