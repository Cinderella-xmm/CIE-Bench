    "Question": "Q1: Are there exactly five ducklings swimming in the foreground of the scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe structure contains six ducklings swimming on the water. This is evident through the distinct rubber duck figures visible within the glass dome. The initial impression of five is due to the layout of ducks, but counting reveals there are six.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the ducklings have their heads above water and bodies partially submerged, indicating swimming motion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ducklings are stylized, resembling toy ducks rather than real ones. Their design suggests that their heads are above the water line, as typical for duck toys, indicating a simulation of swimming. However, the segmented toy-like appearance doesn't depict actual swimming motion realistically as seen in nature.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the bed of smooth, rounded stones clearly visible beneath the water surface in the foreground?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a decorative setup where the stones beneath the water are part of the interior of the glass globe, clearly visible and composed of smooth, rounded stones. This clarity is achieved due to the transparency and design of the object, showcasing these elements prominently.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the reflection of the evergreen trees and sky clearly visible on the water surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the artificial nature of the snow globe and its reflection does not depict a natural reflection of trees and sky on the water surface. The clarity of water allows the natural scenic image to be part of the background but the reflective property focusing on the interior objects detract from the traditional natural settingâ€™s reflection.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are tall evergreen trees densely arranged along both sides of the lake, forming a natural corridor?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows tall evergreen trees which form a boundary along the back of the globe, creating a sense of density and natural corridor. This immersive nature encapsulated within the dome accentuates the ornamental characteristic without actually demonstrating environmental depth.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is a mist-covered mountain range visible in the background beyond the lake?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background depicts a clear mountainous range but does not showcase mist. The immaculately organized nature of the snow globe refines the scene to focus on clarity and form within its parameters, contrasting with natural mist.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the dominant colors of the scene green (trees), blue-green (water), and brown (rocks)?",
    "explanation": "The scene in Image B reflects a color palette that includes green for the trees, blue-green for the water, and brown for the rocks, accentuating these colors through vibrant and saturated design typical of crafted display pieces.",
    "answer": "Yes"
