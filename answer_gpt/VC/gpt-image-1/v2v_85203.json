      "question": "Is the butterfly still positioned centrally in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is depicted as a swirling energy form set against a dark background. This energetic representation occupies the central space just like the butterfly in Image A, which was precisely centered. Common visual cues such as symmetry indicate the centrality of the energy form, similar to the butterfly's position in Image A, which had balanced placement and spacing relative to the edges.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the butterfly retain its blue color theme, even if reinterpreted as energy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a butterfly as a swirling energy in shades of blue. This is consistent with the color theme of Image A, where the butterfly displayed a vibrant blue on its wings. In both images, the predominance of blue is evident, maintaining the theme even though the form in Image B is ethereal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the dark silhouette below the butterfly retain its general rugged shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dark silhouette at the bottom appears jagged and uneven, resembling the rugged form seen in Image A. Despite the reinterpretation and change in texture, Image B keeps this general rugged and rough shape, signifying consistency between both images.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the butterfly still depicted as hovering above the dark silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the swirling form of the butterfly-like energy appears to rise above or emerge from the jagged and dark silhouette, similar to Image A where the butterfly was visually positioned above a black outline. This gives the effect of hovering or floating above its base in both images.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the dark silhouette below the butterfly retain its dark color contrast with the butterfly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image B and Image A, the dark silhouette at the bottom contrasts sharply with the blue hue of the butterfly or its energetic representation. The contrast is maintained, with the dark base in Image B juxtaposed against the bright blue swirls, similar to the contrast seen in Image A between the black base and blue butterfly.",
