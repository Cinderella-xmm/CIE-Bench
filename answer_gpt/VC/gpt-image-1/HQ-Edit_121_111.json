      "question": "Is the squirrel depicted in an upright stance, supported by its hind legs, with its front paws raised toward its mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel is depicted in a fantasy illustration. Its posture suggests that it is sitting on its hind legs, while its front paws are holding a purple gemstone. Although not brought directly to the mouth, this position implies it can bring objects to its mouth easily. This suggests a somewhat upright stance that fits the question's description in spirit, even if not in detail.",
