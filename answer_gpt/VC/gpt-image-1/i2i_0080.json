      "question": "Does the dog retain its reddish-brown fur in both the left side and back views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is shown from both the left side view and the back view. Observing the fur color in both these views, the dog's coat appears to be consistently reddish-brown, similar to what is exhibited in the left side view, which is also visible in the back view. The consistent depiction of fur color suggests that the dog retains its reddish-brown fur regardless of the perspective. World knowledge tells us that dogs, unless specifically styled or painted, usually maintain a consistent fur color across different views.",

      "question": "Are the dog’s floppy ears present and maintained in shape in both views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is depicted with floppy ears visible in the side view. In the back view, the ears appear to hang down naturally, consistent with floppy ears. This shape consistency in both perspectives indicates that the dog's floppy ears are present and maintain the same shape in both the left side and back views. Typically, floppy ears continue to manifest in a similar form from different views, as their structure doesn't significantly change.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog has a red collar with a tag visible in the side view. In the back view, the red collar is consistently shown as encircling the neck, and the presence of a tag can be inferred even though it isn't visually prominent from the back. The depiction of a collar in different angles usually remains constant unless shown otherwise, suggesting the collar and tag are present in both views.",

      "question": "Is the dog still lying on a wooden bed with a green mattress and pillow in both views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The side view in Image B shows the dog lying on a wooden bed with a green mattress and pillow clearly. The back view continues to exhibit the dog's position on the same bed structure with the green mattress and pillow, only with the addition of the dog's back side view off the bed. Beds and their features, like mattresses and pillows, are usually stable across perspectives unless altered, indicating that the dog is lying on the same described bed set.",

      "question": "Is the dog’s bed set against a pale blue background with green grass around it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both views shown in Image B, the dog's bed is placed within a setting featuring a pale blue background with patches of green grass visible around the bed's legs. This consistent depiction of background and foreground elements in both perspectives suggests that the environment encompasses the bed as part of a wider area rather than changing between views. Such stability in background is common in animated or illustrated images conveying a single setting or environment.",
