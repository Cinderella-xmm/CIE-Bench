        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the scene depicted is a whimsical, enchanted forest with fantasy creatures and glowing orbs. The floor, if visible at all, is covered in greenery and doesn't resemble a man-made surface like gray stone-paving. Contrasting this with Image A, the original image, which shows a greenhouse filled with plants on a stone-paved floor, indicates that such a feature is replaced with fantasy elements in Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a dreamlike forest interior without maintaining the structural components of a greenhouse, such as metal support beams or window grids. These are key features in Image A's greenhouse, but in the edited image, they are substituted with fantastical, naturalistic elements that conform to a forest theme.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, does not depict any shelving units, as it is set in a whimsical, nature-centric world with no obvious functional features such as shelves with wheels. In Image A, the original greenhouse, such details are part of its human-made organizational structures, which are absent in the edited image.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any recognizable greenhouse furniture like shelves, nor are plants in black plastic pots depicted. The visual style is more about magical and ethereal elements. In Image A, pots and plants are clearly organized on shelves, a detail transformed in the edited image to align with its fantasy theme.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",

The edited scene is an imaginative forest setting without structured spatial arrangements such as aisles or shelving, aligning more with a magical narrative environment.",
