      "question": "Is the Mustang logo visible and intact on the grille in all views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front view of the car's drawing clearly shows the Mustang logo prominently positioned and intact on the grille. Each depiction of the car in the diagram incorporates major design elements typically evident in schematic representations, such as emblems, to clearly identify the vehicle make and model. Thus, from the visual cues, it can be concluded that the Mustang logo is visible and intact.",

      "question": "Does the side view of the car include the GT badge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the side view of the car shows a GT badge located near the front wheel area on the drawing of the car. This badge is essential in identifying the specific variant of the vehicle, and its inclusion is consistent with a detailed automotive diagram that aims to document version details.",

      "question": "Are the wheels depicted with the same black multi-spoke design in all views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blueprint style drawing outlines the wheels generally, aiming to capture their structure and style rather than detailed color schemes like black. The precise intricacies and coloring of a black multi-spoke design are not distinctly visible in a line drawing format that focuses on shape and form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the car consistently depicted in black with its original sleek shape across all views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car diagram focuses on structural and design shapes rather than color representations due to its schematic format. Therefore, while the line drawing maintains the car's sleek shape, it does not depict color details. The consistent depiction of black is not visible within the grayscale format. The focus remains on shape and structure without explicit coloring.",

      "question": "Do the headlights and exhaust outlets appear correctly placed and designed in all views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drawing's front and side views correctly display the headlights; viewed in a blueprint style that identifies their position and basic design within the car's framework. The rear view includes the exhaust outlets, placed at the expected location for a Mustang model. The line drawing captures the standard placement and basic design features that are typical in a car diagram, confirming their correct arrangement.",
