      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the nemes headdress present with its characteristic wide, striped, layered shape covering the head and shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the headdress has a distinct design with prominent mechanical and steampunk elements, diverging from the traditional nemes headdress seen in Image A. While it suggests a covering shape for the head and shoulders akin to the traditional nemes shape, the structure and style are significantly different due to the mechanical decorations and lack of traditional fabric stripes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the uraeus cobra positioned centrally on the forehead, above the eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no distinct ornamental design that resembles a uraeus cobra traditionally seen on ancient Egyptian pharaoh regalia. Instead, there is a central green gem decoration, which evokes elegance but does not replicate the specific form or symbolism of a uraeus.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a false beard extending vertically from the chin, matching the original pleated form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a structure resembling a false beard extending downwards, but it is more cylindrical and stylized to fit a steampunk aesthetic rather than maintaining the pleated, traditional form seen in original Egyptian artifacts.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the eyes almond-shaped and positioned symmetrically beneath thick eyebrows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features, including eyes and eyebrows, are obscured. Hence, it is impossible to verify the shape or symmetry of the eyes based on the given content.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ears are visible and appear on both sides of the head. They retain a natural human shape that can be recognized despite the mechanical design elements surrounding them.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a broad collar encircling the neck, maintaining its original width and horizontal band structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the collar is lavishly decorated in a mechanical style, clearly diverging from the original broad collar with simple horizontal band motifs, aligning more with a steampunk theme rather than traditional Egyptian designs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the mask presented in a strictly frontal, symmetrical view with no rotation or tilt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mask is presented symmetrically and frontally. The ornate details are evenly balanced on either side, supporting the idea of a frontal and symmetrical presentation without noticeable tilts or rotation of the imagery.",
