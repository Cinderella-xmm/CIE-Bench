    "Question": "Q1: Are the individual flower petals shaped like elongated, recurved lily petals with six distinct segments per bloom?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers have a crystalline appearance with sharp, faceted shapes resembling pointed star shapes rather than the natural flowing and slightly curved shape of lily petals. Each 'petal' is angular and has a gem-like quality, deviating significantly from the elongated, recurved natural petals of lilies which typically have six distinct segments per bloom. Thus, they do not match the description of lily petals.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the bouquet arranged in a tightly packed, spherical cluster with multiple flowers overlapping?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a bouquet where the crystal flowers are symmetrically arranged with each flower clearly distinguishable due to the rigid and structured nature of their crystalline form. Unlike a natural bouquet which might exhibit some overlapping due to soft petals, the mechanical arrangement of these faceted flowers doesnâ€™t present as a tightly packed, spherical cluster with overlapping blooms.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a transparent, cylindrical glass vase holding the bouquet?",
    "explanation": "Based on visual cues in Image B, the bouquet is placed in a cylindrical container that appears transparent and glass-like, as evidenced by the visibility of the supporting stems/rods inside. This indicates the container meets the description of a transparent, cylindrical glass vase.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the vase positioned directly beneath the bouquet, with stems/rods extending upward from it?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the bouquet is clearly anchored to the glass vase with supporting rods extending upward into the arrangement of crystal flowers. This setup shows that the vase is directly beneath the bouquet with stems/rods extending upwards, consistent with a standard floral arrangement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there approximately ten to twelve flowers visible in the bouquet, including both open blooms and closed buds?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a clear countable arrangement of the flowers, with the crystal objects visually identifying as flowers. There are more than the specified number of 10 to 12 flowers, as the arrangement contains a visibly ample number of crystalline blooms exceeding this count, ruling out approximate adherence to the given number.",
    "answer": "No"
