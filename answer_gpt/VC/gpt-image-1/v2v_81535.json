      "question": "Does the image retain the white porcelain bowl with a blue floral design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white porcelain bowl with a blue floral design is very clearly visible. The bowl is a distinct feature with its contrasting blue pattern on a white background, which matches traditional ceramic designs. This detail remains unchanged from Image A, where the dish is also served in a similar bowl.",

      "question": "Is the orange curry sauce still visible, coating the transformed elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an orange sauce visible that coats the elements within the bowl, creating a visual consistency with what one might expect from a curry dish. The sauce has a vibrant orange color, typical of many curry dishes, and is applied consistently over the spherical forms, which can be identified as dragon eggs.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the transformed elements (dragon eggs and dragons) arranged within the bowl in a manner consistent with the original dish's placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the pieces of chicken or other food items are heaped in a bowl, haphazardly placed to fit within the container. In Image B, while the dragon eggs and dragon figurines are positioned decoratively, the general placement—in that the food items are arranged to occupy the space of the bowl effectively—is similar. The elements are clustered within the bowl, akin to how food is placed in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the kitchen countertop background still present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a countertop-like surface is still visible, providing context to the setting where the bowl is placed. This is a common background for kitchenware and food presentation in a home environment, and it is consistent with the background in Image A, where kitchen countertops are part of the surrounding environment.",

      "question": "Does the orange curry sauce retain its glossy texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the orange sauce with a distinctive glossy texture, which is indicative of its similarity to the kind of finish seen in well-prepared sauce-heavy dishes, such as curries. This gloss is a typical attribute of oily or watery curry sauces, as seen in Image A, and is retained in the transformation to maintain realism.",
