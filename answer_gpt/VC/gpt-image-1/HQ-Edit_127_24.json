    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there exactly two chalet-style buildings visible in the scene, positioned side-by-side on a snowy slope?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene depicts a singular ice castle with multiple spires, surrounded by icy landscape. The structure is distinctly different from chalet-style buildings, which are typically wooden and found in snowy mountain regions. No buildings positioned side-by-side are visible, hence it indicates a different type of architecture and ambiance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there visible smoke rising from at least one chimney on a building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an ice castle, which does not have chimneys typical to chalet-style buildings. An ice structure would not conventionally feature smokey chimneys, especially given the fantasy setting depicted, therefore no smoke rising is visible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there multiple windows across both buildings that emit a warm yellow-orange glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The windows of Image B's ice castle emit a cool blue glow, consistent with the icy environment and castle structure. This is in stark contrast to the warm yellow-orange glow described, which is characteristic of cozy chalet houses.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there tall, conical evergreen trees with snow-covered branches visible behind and around the chalets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases tall evergreen-like trees that are depicted in shades of ice-blue and do not accompany chalets. The scene presents an icy landscape without the specific chalet buildings described, pointing to a more fantastical scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a large, snow-capped mountain peak visible in the background, rising above the treeline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is composed of stylish, fantasy castle spires against aurora-touched sky, without any distinct snow-capped mountain peak. This setting does not display the mountain characteristics attributed to chalet alpine scenes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there smooth, rounded snowdrifts in the foreground, casting soft shadows toward the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground consists of flat icy terrain rather than rounded snowdrifts. Shadows from the various structures might appear, but the snowdrift characteristics described do not apply to this icy landscape.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a bright, circular light source (moon) visible in the upper-right portion of the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a bright full moon visible in the sky, contributing to the fantastical icy scene and illuminating the ice castle with an ethereal glow. This moon is located in the upper-right portion, aligning with the description.",
