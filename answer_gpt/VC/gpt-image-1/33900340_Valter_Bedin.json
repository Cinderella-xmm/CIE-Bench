    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the central archway positioned at the center of the main structure, forming a passageway between the two vertical pillars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure at the center is not an architectural structure with pillars and archways, but rather a giant humanoid structure resembling a golem with glowing eyes and symbols. This central figure does not resemble an archway or pillars and doesn't form any passageway. Thus, based on visual analysis, the described structure from Image A does not exist in Image B.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the two vertical pillars standing symmetrically on either side of the central archway, forming a tall, narrow gateway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central feature is a large humanoid figure, not an architectural structure with pillars. The lack of pillars or archways suggests that no such symmetrical gateway exists in this image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the battlements along the top of the structure composed of repeating rectangular merlons and gaps (crenels)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a humanoid figure with glowing elements rather than battlements or any architectural features like merlons and crenels. There is no visible structure resembling battlements.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a long, low brick wall running parallel to the main structure on the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image A features a low brick wall, Image B uses a similar composition for thematic effect but with a massive golem figure instead. The left side of Image B suggests a similar wall for environmental consistency, but the focus shifts to the figure. Thus, contextually, it appears plausible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a paved pathway extending from the foreground toward the central archway, running between the low wall and the main structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, even though there's no central archway or main structure as in Image A, the composition suggests a central figure instead. The foreground-to-background layout leading toward this figure implies a pathway. Even if it's metaphorically leading toward the giant rather than physically to an archway, the setting maintains a pathway-like design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there additional arched openings visible to the right of the main central archway, integrated into the same wall structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no main central archway or supporting wall structure. Only a large humanoid figure dominates the view. Therefore, there cannot be additional arched openings since there is no wall or archway structure present.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the small human figure located on the pathway, positioned behind the viewer and moving toward the central archway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the small human figure is visible, seeming to face the large humanoid structure with a glow between them. While it suggests orientation toward this central figure, there is no physical archway. The presence of this figure and its direction toward the important subject invokes a similar effect, though not literally towards an archway as in Image A.",
