      "question": "Does the edited image retain the figure's iconic screaming posture and facial expression, including the wide-open mouth and hands on ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the figure maintains the pose with hands on either side of the face, indicative of the iconic screaming posture. Although the specific facial expression is not visible due to the blur, the posture itself suggests the same classic stance. This is aligned with the typical depiction from Edvard Munch's 'The Scream,' where the figure is noted for the hands-on-face gesture. Thus, it retains the iconic posture.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the figure still wearing the blue garment and has the same pale face as in the original painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the figure is seen wearing a long, blue garment similar to the original painting. Even though the facial features are obscured, the clothing remains recognizable as a key aspect of the character's depiction in Munch's work. Therefore, the figure's attire remains consistent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the figure positioned on what appears to be the edge of a bridge or platform, similar to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the background has changed to a battlefield scene with explosions, deviating from the serene, bridge-like setting in 'The Scream.' The character appears out of this typical environment, suggesting they are no longer on an edge of a bridge or platform consistent with the original painting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image retains the use of distorted and swirling lines for the figureâ€™s body, continuing the original painting's style of expressing emotion and internal turmoil through abstract forms. These lines are reflective of the expressionist style intended to convey the intense emotion of anxiety and fear.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image utilizes expressive, swirling lines throughout the scene, a hallmark of Munch's style in 'The Scream.' Despite the different thematic setting, the utilization of similar brushstroke techniques keeps the emotive style consistent with the original painting.",
