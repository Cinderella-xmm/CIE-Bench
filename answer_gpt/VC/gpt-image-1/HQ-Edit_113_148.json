      "question": "Does the transformed sculpture retain a central tall spire flanked by multiple smaller turrets arranged symmetrically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal sculpture maintains a central tall spire. This spire is accompanied by smaller turrets, arranged in a symmetrical manner, which is commonly seen in castle architecture. Such symmetry and structure suggest the design intention to resemble a traditional castle layout. This indicates that the transformed sculpture has retained the symmetrical arrangement of its parts.",

      "question": "Are there small red flags positioned at the tip of each turret of the crystal sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a crystal sculpture without any visible flags atop the turrets. While flags are often used in traditional castle representations to indicate battlements or towers, in this instance, the crystal material does not include any flags, as shown by the crystal turrets having pointed tops devoid of additional decorations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the shovel located in the foreground, angled toward the base of the castle, and partially submerged in reflective water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shovel is positioned in the foreground, resting on a surface that appears to support the castle structure. Unlike Image A where the shovel is interacting with wet sand creating reflections, Image B's crystal shovel does not show any signs of being submerged in water, and is simply laying flat and solid on the surface without apparent reflections or water interaction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the gemstones (replacing seashells) grouped in a cluster at the foot of the crystal castle, similar to the original shell arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a variety of gemstones scattered around the foundation of the castle. These gemstones appear to be dispersed rather uniformly around the crystal sculpture. While they are scattered at the base of the crystal castle, their arrangement does mimic the original shell distribution seen in Image A, forming a similar clustered base styling.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the frosted glass slab feature a continuous horizontal wave pattern that mimics the original oceanâ€™s rolling motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the slab beneath the crystal castle has a pattern that resembles waves, although they appear static and less dynamic compared to the ocean's rolling waves seen in Image A. The slab's wave-like design captures the concept of waves through a textured surface, though it is not continuous or flowing like the original image's ocean depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the tallest tower located centrally within the crystal sculpture, rising above all other structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a crystal sculpture where the tallest tower is positioned at the center of the overall structure, standing taller than other surrounding turrets. Such an arrangement typically emphasizes the aesthetics of grandeur, focusing heights centrally, aligning with common architectural principles seen in castles.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the shovel retain a red blade and yellow handle, even if rendered in crystal or another material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a shovel that is made entirely of a blue transparent crystal material. The shovel's design does not exhibit any red or yellow coloring, unlike Image A, where the traditional red and yellow colors of the toy shovel are used. The material transformation in Image B omits the original color scheme entirely.",
