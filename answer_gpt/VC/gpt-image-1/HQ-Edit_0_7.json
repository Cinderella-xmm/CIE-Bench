      "question": "Is the parrot's head and chest covered in bright red feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The parrot in Image B is depicted with a head and chest covered in bright red feathers. This is evident from the cartoonish and simplistic design where the parrot's entire upper body is shown in a solid red color. The bright red color is a characteristic typically associated with certain types of parrots, such as the scarlet macaw.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the parrot's wings display a combination of blue, green, and yellow feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parrot's wings indeed show a combination of blue, green, and yellow feathers. These colors are applied in a stylized manner with distinct sections in a simplified format, consistent with the design of a cartoon parrot illustration. Such color combinations are common in parrots, like the macaw.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the parrot have a long tail with distinct red, blue, and yellow striped feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the parrot with a tail that does not prominently display distinct striping of red, blue, and yellow feathers. Instead, the tail is shown in a solid cartoonish red matching the illustration style. The absence of distinct stripes suggests a simplification of the parrot's design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the parrot have a large, curved beak with a pale gray upper part and black lower part?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parrot is illustrated with a large curved beak that is uniformly pale in color, without a clear distinction between gray and black parts. The cartoon style simplifies the beak into a single color, typical in illustrative depictions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the parrot positioned upright on a branch with its head turned toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The parrot in Image B is depicted upright on a branch, facing toward the viewer, which is common in portraits where subjects are often designed to appear engaging to the audience. The illustration emphasizes the face and eyes directed towards the viewer.",

      "question": "Is the parrot perched on a branch covered in green moss?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the parrot perched on a branch with a simplified cartoonish representation of moss. The branch the parrot stands on is designed with a visually green texture, suggesting moss coverage even in a stylized form.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there large, vibrant green leaves encircling the parrot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Though Image B contains green leaves behind the parrot, they are not large nor vibrant. The illustration shows small stylized green leaves contained within a dome, which differs from an encircling vibrant natural appearance.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parrot's eye is depicted as large, round, and featuring a dark pupil within a cartoon context. However, the eye is not yellow; instead, it blends into the illustrative design that deviates from realistic parrot features.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays moss in a simplified cartoon style without intricate detailing to show fuzziness or texture. Instead, the green coverage on the branch is represented as a solid, smooth surface typical in simplified illustrations.",
