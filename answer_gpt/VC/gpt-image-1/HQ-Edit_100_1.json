    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the tree's central position with a wide, spreading canopy and visible branching structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree is still centrally positioned within the confines of the frame. The canopy spreads widely across the image, filling much of the top central area, with its branches extending in a recognizable pattern common to tree structures. The emphasis on central positioning is also evident due to the balanced composition around the tree in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the leaves of the tree still displaying a visible gradient from green to orange and red?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves of the tree exhibit a transition of colors from green to orange and red. This coloration is apparent in the canopy, where the blend of colors creates a gradient effect typically found in trees during the fall season. The presence of multiple leaf colors indicates the retained gradient effect from green to red.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the meadow clearly divided into a pink/red floral area on the left and a green daisy-filled area on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the meadow does not exhibit a clear division between two distinct floral areas. The entire ground area under the tree is uniformly filled with various colors of flowers without a left or right demarcation. This continuous spread of mixed colors suggests that the meadow does not possess a clearly divided color scheme as described.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are white daisies still present in the green section of the meadow on the right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is extensive floral diversity in the meadow, and among these, large white daisies are visibly present throughout, confirming that these white flowers are still an integral part of the floral composition.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a visible glow or backlight effect shining through the treeâ€™s leaves from behind?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears flat and consistent across the scene, with no evident light source creating a backlight effect through the tree leaves. The absence of bright, glowing highlights typically associated with backlight suggests there is no significant backlight effect.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the tree's base visibly rooted in the ground of the meadow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree is visually anchored into the ground of the meadow, giving a sense of stability and rootedness. The visible trunk extends down to a mound, which simulates a rooted base in a natural setting.",
