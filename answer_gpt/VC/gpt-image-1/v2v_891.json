      "question": "Does the edited image retain a central object resembling a monitor, even in a stylized form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an object centrally placed in the composition with a rectangular shape and a stand, reminiscent of a computer monitor. The presence of a face, which is stylized with eyes and a smile, further suggests a caricature of a monitor. This indicates that the object’s form and placement mimic the typical appearance of a monitor, albeit in a playful design. Comparatively, in Image A, the monitor is clearly visible, confirming that the edited version is a stylized form of this object.",

      "question": "Does the edited image include an object resembling a speaker, even in a stylized form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a box-like object with round features on the left side, which closely resembles a speaker's general shape and front design. The object is stylized with cartoon-like features but maintains the vertical, boxy form typical of speakers. In Image A, the speaker is clearly identified by its distinct form and placement, validating that Image B includes a stylized form.",

      "question": "Does the edited image include an object resembling a computer tower, even in a stylized form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a block-shaped object with markings that parody a computer tower's face, such as the expressions and simple lines indicating typical drive slots. These characteristics align with those in Image A, where the tower’s rectangular vertical structure and distinguishing features are presented. Thus, Image B cleverly maintains the essence of the computer tower's form in a cute format.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object in front of the monitor is flat and rectangular, similar to a keyboard layout. It has markings resembling keys and is augmented with playful facial features, aligning with the distinct placement and design of the keyboard visual seen in Image A. This suggests that the edited version retains the foundational identity of a keyboard through stylization.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a rounded object next to the keyboard with facial characteristics, which aligns with the typical shape and placement of a computer mouse. The simplified form carries features that distinguish it from other objects on the desk. Image A similarly depicts a clear mouse design next to the keyboard, confirming that Image B preserves this object’s identity through cartoon styling.",
