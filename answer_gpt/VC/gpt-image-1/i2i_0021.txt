    "Question": "Q1: Are the three sheep positioned near each other, with one adult sheep interacting closely with the two younger ones?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, three chibi animals are positioned standing side by side, closely grouped together. Based on the visual cues, there are no noticeable interactions between one designated adult and the two younger ones as they are facing the same direction in a straightforward manner without suggesting a specific interaction or communication between any of the figures.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the chibi sheep maintain their original postures, with the adult sheep standing upright and the younger ones leaning towards it?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi animals are depicted in a cartoonish style, lined up next to each other. All three figures stand with a similar posture that doesn't demonstrate any leaning or distinctive posture differentiation between an adult and younger animals. Thus, within Image B, the design choice is consistent for all figures and does not reflect the described arrangement.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the chibi sheep retain a representation of their woolly texture, even in a stylized or simplified manner?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents the sheep figure with a simplified design that reflects a woolly texture.
