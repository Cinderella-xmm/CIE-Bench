        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face and expression of the monkey are not visible as the face is blurred. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether it is clear or distorted.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
