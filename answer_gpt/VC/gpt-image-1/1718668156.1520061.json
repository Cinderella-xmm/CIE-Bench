      "question": "Is the amber-colored liquid visible in the short glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the short glass displays an orange glow that simulates the appearance of a filled liquid in a neon style. This visual cue suggests an amber-colored liquid is present. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that orange and amber share similar hues, and the neon style of Image B does not change this fundamental coloration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is a yellow straw inserted into the short glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the short glass contains a yellow straw, which is evident from the neon outline of the straw that is distinctly colored yellow, similar to a tubular object. This indicates consistency with visual depictions of a straw.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are ice cubes visible within the short glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The short glass in Image B shows glowing structures that resemble ice cubes. The neon-style illumination makes the ice cubes evident through their distinct cubic shapes, which is a common visual representation of ice.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tall glass completely filled with ice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tall glass has a design using blue neon lights that shows cubic shapes suggesting the presence of ice, but it does not appear completely filled, as there are visual gaps. The neon design creates a transparent effect with visible space, suggesting a non-full glass.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Are the sail-like shells of the Sydney Opera House visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B features a structure outlined in neon that matches the iconic silhouette of the Sydney Opera House, characterized by its sail-like shells. The visual element despite its transformation to a neon style retains the recognizable forms.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a stone ledge beneath the two glasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area beneath the glasses is depicted as a grid pattern resembling a digital design, which replaces any stone or actual physical ledge characteristics. This pattern does not suggest a physical ledge like in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the two glasses positioned side by side on the ledge, with the short glass on the left and the tall glass on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two neon-outlined glasses maintain their relative positions as observed in Image A, with the short glass on the left and the tall glass on the right. This is consistent in both images despite the neon conversion.",
      "weight": 2,
