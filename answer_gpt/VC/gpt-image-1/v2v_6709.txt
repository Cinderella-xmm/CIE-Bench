    "Question": "Q1: Is the faceted star-shaped pattern covering the body of the perfume bottle preserved in the Lego version?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the Lego perfume bottle features a pattern that mimics the faceted star-shaped design seen on the original glass bottle from Image A. The star-shaped pattern on Image B appears crafted using Lego bricks to replicate the geometric details observed on the glass surface of the original bottle. The Lego bricks are organized to emulate the three-dimensional texture of the original bottle, maintaining the visual appearance of facets and depth.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the perfume bottle maintain its cylindrical shape with tapered sides and flat base in the Lego construction?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the Lego bottle retains a shape that is vertically elongated and tapers slightly toward the neck, similar to Image A. The Lego construction attempts to replicate the geometric tapering, although the precision is limited by the blocky nature of Lego pieces, which are less smooth than the glass shape apparent in the original image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the gold faceted spherical cap positioned at the top of the bottle preserved in the Lego version?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a Lego representation of the gold faceted spherical cap depicted in Image A. The Lego cap mirrors the geometry and position of the original, showcasing multiple facets through the use of angled Lego pieces to capture the same design style. The cap is positioned atop the bottle consistently in both images.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the spray nozzle located on the side of the bottle’s neck, with a visible mist plume extending diagonally outward, preserved in the Lego version?",
    "explanation": "The spray nozzle in Image B is preserved in its position relative to the bottle’s neck, identical to Image A. Both images present a visible mist plume extending diagonally outward, the depiction identical in form despite being translated into a Lego representation in Image B.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the undulating folds of the fabric background beneath the bottle preserved in form and position in the Lego version?",
    "explanation": "Image B replaces the fabric folds with a background crafted from Lego bricks that attempts to emulate the curved patterns and undulations seen in Image A. However, the Lego version uses block structures and does not maintain the soft, fabric-like appearance of the original image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the perfume bottle positioned directly on top of the fabric background, maintaining contact and alignment with the folds, in the Lego version?",
    "explanation": "The Lego bottle in Image B is positioned on a base of Lego bricks mimicking a rough terrain rather than directly on folded fabric as visible in Image A. The contact and alignment are not the same due to the differing nature of the substrates beneath the bottle.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the size of the gold cap proportionally consistent with the body of the bottle in the Lego version?",
    "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the gold cap appears proportionally consistent relative to the body of the perfume bottle despite the differing materials. The size and relative scale between the cap and the body are preserved in Lego, ensuring similar proportion as observed in the glass construction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
