    "Question": "Q1: Is the ogre's skin still greenish-gray in color?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ogre's skin appears to be a solid, brighter green, typical of a playful, cartoonish depiction. In contrast, the more realistic Image A shows a greenish-gray complexion that is more nuanced and textured, resembling a natural tone.

    "Question": "Q4: Does the ogre still wear a tattered loincloth with visible frayed edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ogre is wearing a stylized loincloth that appears smoother and less detailed, consistent with a toy-like or simplified art style. The edges are not visibly frayed.
