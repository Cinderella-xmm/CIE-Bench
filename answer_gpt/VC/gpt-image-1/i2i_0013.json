      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) displays a stylized depiction reminiscent of Einstein's iconic hairstyle. The character features large, exaggerated strands of white or light-colored hair that are disheveled, which is a visual trait commonly associated with Einstein.

Based on these observations, the edited image retains the essence of Einstein's distinctive hairstyle.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the character is sticking out his tongue, which mirrors the famous photograph of Einstein playfully sticking out his tongue.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image presents a stylized, cartoonish version of Einstein, characterized by exaggerated and simplified facial features. While the face shape and proportions are not realistically maintained, the general form, with prominent features such as the mustache and expressive eyes, still represents a recognizable caricature of Einstein. As the edited image takes creative liberties with proportions typical of chibi art style, it does not maintain the realistic face shape and proportions.",
