        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image of the figurine, the 'CRAFT' logo is clearly visible on the upper right shoulder. It is a recognizable logo for sportswear that typically includes a stylized font and dots following the word, suggesting precision and technicality. This placement is common for branding in apparel.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), glasses are visible. They have black-framed features, mentioning tortoiseshell-patterned temples requires close observation, which is not discernible in the provided image due to blurring, hence the pattern cannot be confirmed.",
