      "question": "Is the large black patch on the left shoulder of the cow present and clearly defined?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction is of a cartoon cow characterized by simplified shapes and colors typical of chibi design, where features are exaggerated or minimized for cuteness. The cow in Image B has a black patch on its left shoulder, but it is simplified and stylized, not large or clearly defined as seen in realistic representations. Therefore, the patch is present but doesn't match the description of being large and clearly defined.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon cow features a stylized face with rounded features typical of chibi design. The cow lacks a continuous white stripe from the forehead to the snout, focusing more on a cute, simplistic design. The facial markings are not detailed like those in realistic depictions but rather aim for a stylized appearance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon cow features horns that have an upward and outward curve, resembling typical chibi art style, which often exaggerates these features for cuteness. The horns have a light tan color with no distinct dark tips but are consistent with a stylized cartoon approach rather than realistic detail.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the television depicted maintains a retro design with a speaker grille visible on the right side. There are also visible elements that resemble control knobs at the bottom, typical of older TV models. This matches the described features, following a playful cartoon rendition.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon cow is shown with its front hooves positioned adorably atop the television, accentuating the playful, chibi style. The exaggerated size and positioning fit the art style, where the cow interacts directly with the TV.",
