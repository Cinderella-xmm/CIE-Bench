    "Question": "Q1: Is the central positioning and rectangular shape of the light blue sofa retained in the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the main features of the blue sofa, including its central placement within the room and its distinct rectangular shape, are preserved. The swirling patterns around the sofa do not obscure its basic shape or position. This suggests that the artist aimed to maintain these key elements while transforming the texture and appearance into a painterly style. In comparison, Image A also shows the sofa centrally positioned and rectangular, confirming consistency in both shape and location.",
