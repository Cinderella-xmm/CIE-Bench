      "question": "Does the image retain the Mercedes-Benz grille and logo on the front of the van?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "First, consider the visual cues in Image B. The grille and logo in Image B show an arrangement typical for Volkswagen vehicles with an iconic VW logo, differing from the distinct look of a Mercedes-Benz grille, which features a star logo central to the grille. Common knowledge about car designs helps identify the unique VW signature elements replacing Mercedes-Benz's in Image B. Upon comparing Image A, the Mercedes-Benz logo and grille indeed contrast with the VW-styled elements seen in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the overall shape and structure of the van consistent with the original Mercedes-Benz Sprinter design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a classic Volkswagen van with rounded edges and a vintage appearance, typical of the iconic VW models used during the mid-20th century, differing from the modern and angular shape of the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter. When analyzed through visual cues and understanding of vehicle design, the structure in Image B appears distinct from the streamlined, tall structure of the Sprinter shown in Image A, revealing different designs.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the wheels placed in the same positions and maintain similar sizes as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the wheels are placed under the vehicle with a typical VW design featuring smaller, vintage-style wheels compared to the larger wheels on modern vans. Image A, representing the Sprinter, has wheels aligned with a contemporary model, holding a precise, distinct placement and size design which contrasts the retro design seen on Image B. Comparing both images shows variance in wheel design and positioning due to differing vehicle models and production eras.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the van still have clean lines and no visible side windows on the cargo area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visual cues from Image B reveal a design primarily lacking side windows, consistent with vintage cargo models, maintaining clean lines seen on classic vans. Given that the van in Image B features this hallmark style similar to the panel structure of Mercedes-Benz's Sprinter image in Image A—sans visible side windows—the design characteristics align in terms of clean lines. Therefore, despite differing model styles, both images exhibit similar design characteristics in this aspect.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the van retain the large windshield with the same dimensions as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the windshield reflects vintage norms for smaller and rounded windows, typical of the era seen in classic Volkswagen vans, contrasting with the large, rectangular windshield on the modern Mercedes-Benz Sprinter model displayed in Image A. Examining both styles reveal Image B’s smaller windshield doesn’t match the size consistency seen in Image A’s large, taller windshield design.",
