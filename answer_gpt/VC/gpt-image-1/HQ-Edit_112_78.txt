    "Question": "Q1: Is the central floral medallion located on the front center of the body, surrounded by symmetrical scrollwork?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the centerpiece of the object is a candle with an embossed pattern and a label reading 'Elegance Aroma'. The ornate patterns around the candle mirror a floral medallion style but the candle itself doesn't feature a distinct central floral medallion as it is in Image A, which portrays this design feature prominently on the teapot. Therefore, the candle does not have a central floral medallion located on the front center surrounded by symmetrical scrollwork.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the spout extend from the left side of the body with a curled, scroll-like tip?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a decorative lid with a handle, resembling a teapot handle, placed atop a candle. There is no spout present in Image B, as the function of the object is different (a candle). In Image A, the teapot features a prominent spout extending from the left that ends with a curled tip, but Image B lacks a spout altogether.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the handle on the right side of the body shaped like a C with ornate volute ends?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is an ornate element resembling a handle attached to the lid, and it is curved in a manner similar to a 'C' shape with ornate volute ends. Therefore, based on its design and placement, the handle visible in Image B is similar to what the question describes even though it does not serve the purpose as in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a small decorative finial atop the lid?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a decorative lid placed above the candle with a prominent finial on top, aligning well with typical finial designs. This finial acts as a decorative element atop the lid. In Image A, the teapot lid indeed has a finial, and Image B's lid mimics this feature.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there four ornate feet supporting the base of the object?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the candle rests on a marble base without any visible feet. Image A displays a teapot with distinct ornate feet supporting it. The design in Image B lacks any similar features.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the floral and foliate patterns arranged symmetrically around the body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the candle features embossed patterns that are symmetrical, contributing to a balanced design similar to floral and foliate patterns. Image A's teapot is heavily adorned with symmetrical floral designs as well. Thus, Image B maintains symmetrical decorative patterns around the candle.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the object retain the same overall rounded silhouette with a domed lid and balanced spout and handle?",
    "explanation": "The object in Image B is a cylindrical candle with a decorative lid on top. While the lid appears domed and decorative, the silhouette does not match the teapot's rounded body with handle and spout from Image A. The rounded silhouette and functional parts are different due to the change in object type.",
    "answer": "No"
