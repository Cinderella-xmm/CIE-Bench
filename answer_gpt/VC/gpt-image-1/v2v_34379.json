      "question": "Are the broccoli florets in both dishes still composed of distinct tree-like branching structures with dark green crowns and lighter green stems?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the broccoli florets in both the raw and roasted forms retain their typical tree-like structures. The raw broccoli exhibits dark green crowns with lighter green stems, which is commonly observed. The roasted broccoli also preserves its structure, albeit with browning due to the roasting process. Since the original form is identifiable through these visual cues, drawing on the knowledge of the typical appearance of broccoli, they can still be recognized as maintaining their distinct structures.",
