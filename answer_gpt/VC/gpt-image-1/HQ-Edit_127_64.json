    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the Eiffel Towerâ€™s full lattice structure, including its three-tiered arches and pointed spire, clearly visible and structurally accurate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower is depicted, but it is rendered in a silhouette style typical for illustrations. The structural details like lattice design and arches are implied rather than fully depicted, which limits the structural accuracy compared to a realistic photograph. The focus in Image B is on thematic representation rather than structural realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the hedges arranged in a straight line with consistent cubic shapes and even spacing along the left side of the pathway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stylized and simplified version of hedges, depicted consistently with cubic shapes and appear in a straight line, mirroring the alignment typically desired for orderly hedge arrangements, which matches the visual effect as expected for the illustration format.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sandy pathway extend directly from the foreground toward the Eiffel Tower, maintaining a straight trajectory without bends or interruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pathway is illustrated to extend directly from the foreground toward the Eiffel Tower in a simplified and uninterrupted manner, maintaining a straight trajectory typical of illustration style representations.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sun located in the upper-left portion of the sky with a clear starburst effect radiating outward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the sun appears in the upper left with a star-style representation, matching the generic and graphic depiction expected in illustrations, although lacking in the detailed starburst typically seen in realistic images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows stylized lampposts along the pathway, designed to represent traditional lanterns and spaced along the path, maintaining a regular placement, as expected in illustrative depictions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there multiple individuals visible in the park, positioned naturally along the path and grassy areas, interacting with the environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays silhouettes and simplified figures of people, but does not illustrate multiple individuals interacting or positioned naturally in the park like in a photograph; it has chosen to focus on iconic symbols rather than detailed human presence.",
