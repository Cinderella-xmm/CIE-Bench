    "Question": "Q1: Is the number '7' clearly visible on both the front fender and side panel of the motorcycle?",
    "explanation": "Image B is a stylized graphic illustration featuring a motorcycle rider. The distinct features like numbers are purposely not detailed in this kind of artistic representation, focusing instead on the overall dynamic and color theme. Thus, the number '7' is not discernible on the motorcycle.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Is the track outline labeled '5/5' present in the upper-right corner of the image?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a graphic outline of a race track, but it is colorful and does not contain any numerical labels. The aesthetics of the image emphasize visual appeal over specific details, which would include numerical labels like '5/5'.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the dust trail originate directly from the rear wheel of the motorcycle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the artwork highlights a stylized and abstract representation of speed and movement rather than precise mechanical realism. The dust or motion depiction uses strokes and lines emanating in different directions, giving a sense of motion rather than literally showing dust from the rear wheel.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the rider depicted in a forward-leaning posture with hands gripping the handlebars?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the silhouette of a rider who appears to be bent forward slightly, indicative of a forward-leaning posture typical of motorcycle racing, with hands positioned near where handlebars would be, suggesting a riding position.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the front wheel circular with a blue rim?",
    "explanation": "The illustration in Image B uses artistic liberties to portray elements abstractly. The wheels are simplified, and their color detail, like a blue rim, is not laid out in the stylized illustration. The focus is primarily on shape and movement rather than specific color details.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the rider positioned in the foreground with the desert landscape behind them and the track outline in the upper-right corner?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the rider is in the foreground as part of the dominant imagery. However, the background is a predominantly abstract orange design depicting dynamic lines, not a realistic desert landscape. The track outline is present but positioned such that it does not form a direct background setting nor has a clear placement relative to the described desert layout.",
    "answer": "No"
