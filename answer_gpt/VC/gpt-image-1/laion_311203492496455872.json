      "question": "Is the red circular insignia still present on the left lapel of the suit jacket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red circular insignia is not visible. The lapel of the suit in Image B is depicted in a different, cartoon-like style, which does not preserve the same level of detail as in Image A. Based on the concept that illustrations or cartoon depictions are often simplified and can omit small details, the insignia is not retained in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the ear clearly visible on the left side of the head in its original anatomical position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ear is clearly depicted on the left side of the head in its original anatomical position. The cartoon-style representation makes it distinct and visible, maintaining its standard location.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the mouth open in a natural smile showing the upper row of teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mouth in Image B is not visible due to the blurred face. Therefore, no details about a smile or teeth are available in the context of the edited image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the nose retaining its original shape with a distinct bridge and rounded tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blurred face makes it impossible to observe any specific details about the nose, including its shape, bridge, or tip. Therefore, such features cannot be determined from the image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The head in Image B is slightly turned to the side, similar to Image A. The orientation indicates a three-quarter profile view as visible from the ear and the direction the chest and shoulders are facing.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background uniformly off-white with no additional textures or objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is depicted in a uniform color and style, similar to Image A, which is a plain, off-white color without any additional textures or objects. Typically, minimalist or plain backgrounds indicate simplicity, often used to focus on the main subject in illustrations.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the shadows under the chin and along the jawline soft and consistent with even frontal lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stylized nature of Image B does not portray shadows the same way a photograph might. The lighting in cartoons often simplifies shadow complexity, and in this image, there are no distinct shadows as seen in realistic portrayals, hence no soft shadows or specific lighting effects are depicted.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design of the suit and shirt collar is stylized but remains connected and aligned under the suit jacket, consistent with how a collar would conventionally be depicted in both artistic and realistic representations.",
