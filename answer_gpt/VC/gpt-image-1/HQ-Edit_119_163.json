    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the embossed dragons with detailed scales, claws, and flowing bodies clearly visible on the body of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object features a dragon motif that is embossed onto the surface. The embossing includes intricate details such as the dragon's scales, claws, and the undulating form of its body, which are all clearly visible. This outcome is reasoned by closely observing the visible patterns and depth on the objectâ€™s surface, which indicate a relief design.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the surface of the object textured with raised relief patterns, particularly around the dragon motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the object in Image B displays raised areas, notably where the dragon motif is located. These raised parts create a tactile texture known as relief, highlighting the pattern of the dragon and enhancing the design's visibility. This conclusion is drawn from observing the light and shadow effects on the object, typical of embossed or raised elements.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a distinct spout extending from the side of the object, shaped like a dragon's head with an open mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a spout is present; however, it is not shaped like a dragon's head with an open mouth. Instead, the spout is simply cylindrical and labeled with text. This is inferred by examining the structural form and recognizable features of the spout, which lack any dragon-like attributes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the object retain a silver-colored, highly reflective metallic surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B maintains a silver color with a metallic appearance. However, it doesn't exhibit a highly reflective surface, as it seems more matte or diffused in its sheen, which is discerned by the lack of sharp reflections or glare typically associated with polished metal surfaces.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the object positioned upright on a flat surface, such as a wooden table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is positioned upright on what appears to be a flat, wooden table. The base of the object is flat and seated squarely, resting stably, which is evident by the uniform contact with the table's surface, as interpreted through its placement in the image.",
