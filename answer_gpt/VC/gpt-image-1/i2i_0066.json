      "question": "Does the image retain the English Bulldog's tan coat and white facial markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the English Bulldog is represented as a monochromatic, gray statue which inherently does not showcase any specific coat color or facial markings. Therefore, the original tan and white colors found in real bulldogs are not present due to the gray hue of the statue, which makes the bulldog's coat color neutral and unidentifiable. In Image A, the bulldog has a tan coat with white markings, typical of real-life English Bulldogs. Thus, by comparing the two images, Image B does not retain the original color features.",

      "question": "Is the English Bulldog still positioned balancing on the skateboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bulldog statue is placed firmly on the skateboard, clearly depicted by its positioning on the skateboard surface. The statue shows the bulldog standing with all four legs on the board, which implies the bulldog is balancing on it since statues require stability. In Image A, the real bulldog stands with two front legs on a skateboard, suggesting a balancing position. Therefore, compared with Image A, Image B retains the concept of the bulldog balancing on the skateboard, even though as a statue, it represents a static depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts an indoor setting with technological and business conference-like elements in the background, including blue display boards and screens that have no resemblance to outdoor environments. This is vastly different from Image A, where the bulldog is outside, surrounded by grass and buildings which suggest a park or garden setting. Through this comparison using visual cues, Image B does not feature an outdoor setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard is part of the gray statue, and thus it lacks any distinct coloring or design features. The gray material renders the skateboard a uniform color, contrasting the vivid blue design seen in Image A. Image A's skateboard has a clear blue surface with artistic decorations. By comparing both images, Image B does not retain the original color and design of the skateboard.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bulldog statue wearing a harness, depicted in the same gray statue material as the rest of the bulldog and skateboard, without indicating any specific color such as black. In Image A, the bulldog wears a distinct black harness. Therefore, Image B does not retain the original black color of the harness due to the material choice.",
