      "question": "Is the central dome present and positioned directly above the main structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central dome is clearly visible and is positioned directly above the main structure, serving as a prominent architectural feature. This architectural style often includes a dome as a central element, which is consistent with various historical and classic structures.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a golden star located at the very top of the dome’s spire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the dome is shown with a rounded point and no indication of a golden star, which contrasts with typical representations of grand architecture where a spire may sometimes have a decorative feature such as a star.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the windows arranged in a symmetrical grid pattern across the building’s front face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the windows are meticulously arranged in a highly symmetrical and intricate pattern that reflects a deliberate design choice, typical in detailed architectural miniatures like gingerbread structures.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a row of vertical columns forming a portico at the ground level of the building’s front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any vertical columns forming a portico on the ground level. Instead, the focus is on the intricate details of the structure's façade, indicative of decorative architecture rather than functional elements such as columns.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there two large trees with golden-yellow foliage positioned symmetrically on both sides of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees have a sugared, confection-like appearance and are positioned on both sides of the gingerbread house, suggesting an intentional symmetry. However, they aren't large trees with golden-yellow foliage, but rather part of the decorative edible setup.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a straight paved road running in front of the building, parallel to its base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the building on a marble base, often used for displaying confectionery items, which does not resemble a realistic straight paved road. The focus is on the decorative aspect for presentation rather than functional elements like a road.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the building have a square base with rounded corners on the upper levels before transitioning into the dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gingerbread house illustrates a square base, and its levels showcase ornamental frosting that rounds off the edges slightly before transitioning into a domed top. This mimics the aesthetic of transitioning tiers in classic confectionery arts.",
