      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is seen with a traditional white powdered wig where the curls on the sides appear tightly curled.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure wears a distinctive hat as part of the outfit. However, the base color of the hat is more of a dark brown rather than a dark blue, and it bears metallic and steampunk-like embellishments rather than just gold trim. This style indicates a divergence from traditional tricorne styling.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right hand is pictured holding an object that resembles a pocket watch or a similar steampunk gear. The hand is extended forward with the fingers wrapped around the object, indicating that the hand is in a gripping position.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left hand holds an object depicted as a pocket watch, indicating the hand is positioned near the lower torso. The angle suggests that the palm is more likely facing inward, consistent with holding and displaying the object.",
