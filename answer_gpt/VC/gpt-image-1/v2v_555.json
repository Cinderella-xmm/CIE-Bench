      "question": "Are the Colosseum and Big Ben still recognizable as iconic symbols within the snow globe design?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe features two buildings inside. The left structure is a recognizable depiction of the Colosseum, which is a large amphitheater located in Rome, Italy, known for its arches and elliptical shape. The right structure resembles Big Ben, the clock tower of the Palace of Westminster in London, England, identifiable by its clock face and ornate Gothic architecture. The characteristic features of both buildings are visible and maintained inside the snow globe, which helps in recognizing them as their iconic forms.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "The Colosseum inside the snow globe retains the elliptical shape and tiered arches that define its structure. Similarly, Big Ben retains its tower-like structure with the clock feature, ornate details, and pointed spire, making it intact. Both appear accurately represented with their essential features preserved, allowing viewers to recognize their iconic forms.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object shown is a snow globe and does not display any white cups or saucers. Image A features white cups and saucers holding latte art. The transition from cups to a snow globe suggests that the cups and saucers are no longer present in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible wooden surface beneath the snow globe. Image A also presents the latte art cups on a wooden table, contributing to the backdrop. The wooden surface is thus still visible in both images, confirming continuity in visual context regarding the table's appearance.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows structures within the snow globe rendered in brown tones, similar to those used in the latte art of Image A. The coloration for both the Colosseum and Big Ben in the snow globe suggests a visual linkage of the tones used in crafting latte art, indicating the preservation of brown tones across both images.",
