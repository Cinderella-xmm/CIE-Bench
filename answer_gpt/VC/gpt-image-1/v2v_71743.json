      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'NEW YORK Guitar Method' is prominently displayed in a clear and legible font at the top center of the cover.

      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the author's name 'Bruce Arnold' is positioned below 'NEW YORK Guitar Method', featuring a smaller yet still clear and legible font.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar is indeed positioned diagonally across the cover. This is evident by the angle at which the guitar neck and body are positioned, creating a dynamic orientation that crosses from near the top to the bottom of the cover at an angle, differing from a perpendicular or horizontal placement.",
