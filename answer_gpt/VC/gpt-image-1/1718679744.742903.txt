    "Question": "Q1: Is the crocodile's snout with two visible teeth present in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crocodile depicted is a stylized illustration rather than a realistic representation. The snout of the crocodile in the edited image does not feature the same realistic detail as a photograph would, such as two distinct teeth visible on the snout. Instead, it's a cartoon-style design with generalized shapes and patterns. This suggests a creative take rather than a realistic depiction that includes two specific visible teeth.",

While it retains a playful and colorful style akin to a knitted hat, it is heavily stylized with bright colors and patterns.

    "explanation": "In Image B, the crocodile's head is presented in a forward-facing manner with a slight artistic tilt to the left, consistent with the style of the cartoon image. Although more abstract, it follows the orientation seen in Image A where the head is slightly turned to the left, showcasing stylization in alignment direction.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the crocodile partially submerged in water in the edited image?",
