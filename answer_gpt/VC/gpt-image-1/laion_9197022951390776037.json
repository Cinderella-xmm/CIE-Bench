      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'SCARECROW' is prominently displayed at the top of the label, written in a clear and bold typeface that is easy to read. The label is designed to ensure that the text stands out, which is a common design choice for brand names on wine labels. Therefore, the word 'SCARECROW' is both visible and legible.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the year \"2017\" visible somewhere on the bottle or label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection of Image B, '2017' is clearly printed towards the bottom of the label below the word 'SCARECROW', similar to how vintage years are typically showcased on wine labels. This visual cue aligns with standard labeling practices where the year is displayed for consumers to identify the wine's vintage.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the icon at the top of the label, now transformed into a face, retain the shape of a straw hat and rustic features consistent with a scarecrow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the icon at the top of the label has been creatively transformed into a face with eyes and a smile. Despite this transformation, it retains the shape of a straw hat, which is a common feature of scarecrows, known for their rustic qualities. Combining these visual elements effectively communicates the theme of a scarecrow.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the label still a rectangular shape positioned centrally on the front of the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows that the label maintains its rectangular shape, positioned in a centralized manner on the front of the bottle. This analysis is based on the visual arrangement of designs on wine bottles, where labels are generally positioned centrally to ensure they grab the attention of the viewer.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the bottle oriented vertically, standing upright?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle is depicted at an angle rather than standing upright. This is evident by the animated vine arms and the perspective used, which deviates from the typical presentation of wine bottles. This artistic choice aligns with the adventurous theme portrayed in the image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite changes in orientation in Image B, the label remains positioned in the center of the bottle’s height. This can be inferred from its alignment with other features on the bottle, such as the neck and base, and the typical design standard used for displaying labels prominently on bottles.",
