      "question": "Does the image retain the orange tabby fur pattern with distinctive stripe markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible parts of the kitten's body still clearly show an orange tabby fur pattern. The distinctive stripes on the back and sides are visible, indicating that the pattern is retained. This pattern is typical of tabby cats, which are characterized by their striking markings.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the kitten's eyes still green with a clear, open expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes of the kitten are obscured by the blurred section, making it impossible to discern their color or expression. However, based on the visible parts of the kitten, its ears and fur are consistent with the rest of its appearance, suggesting the eyes likely retain their characteristics prior to editing, yet the current state is not visible to confirm.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the kitten's pink nose and surrounding white whiskers present and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area containing the kitten's nose and eyes is blurred, making it impossible to confirm the presence or color of the nose and the surrounding whiskers entirely. However, some whiskers are visible below the blurred area, indicating their presence.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kitten in Image B is clearly in a lying position on a green surface, with its front paws visibly stretched forward under its body. This posture is typical of a relaxed and comfortable position. Thus, it retains the laying posture seen.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is softly defocused with a gradient blur typical in photography to emphasize the subject. This technique is employed to ensure that the viewer's attention remains on the kitten. The editing does not alter the characteristic blur of the background.",
