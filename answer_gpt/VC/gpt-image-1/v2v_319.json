      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is depicted with distinctive clothing that resembles formal attire. He is shown in a dark navy blue suit, which is typically worn with a dress shirt and a tie for formal occasions.

      "question": "Does the ladder have visible wood grain and round dowel joints connecting each rung?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a simplified, stylized representation, common in chibi or cartoon designs that may not detail every element such as wood grain or dowel joints explicitly. While the ladder is shown with design features suggesting wooden characteristics, these specific details like visible wood grain and round dowel joints are not clearly rendered. This absence is typical of stylized designs that often prioritize the overall representation over intricate details.",

      "question": "Is the window divided into six panes with a cream-colored frame and visible reflections of sky and trees in the glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the window is highly stylized and does not provide precise details, such as multiple panes or reflections like those seen typically in realistic portrayals. The frame indeed resembles a simplified cream color, fitting the color scheme, but the specific division into six panes or external reflections are abstracted or omitted, aligning with the animated, simplified nature of the design.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the man depicted in a climbing posture with one foot on a lower rung and the other stepping up, hands gripping the ladder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction in Image B shows the man in a climbing posture associated with climbing activities, where one foot is on a lower rung while the other steps up, and he uses his hands to grip the ladder for support. This design choice emphasizes motion and activity, fitting within the scene's theme of ascension or striving.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the ladder positioned diagonally from the bottom left to the upper right, leading directly to the window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ladder is illustrated with an inclination that represents a diagonal orientation, extending from the lower left toward the upper right, suggestive of the connection toward the window itself. This directionality is emphasized by the spatial arrangement in the composition, aligning with a typical setup for climbing toward an elevated object like a window.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible reflections of sky and tree silhouettes in the window glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B represents a window within the scenario, the stylized and simplified nature of the depiction does not include detailed reflections such as sky or tree silhouettes. Such elements are typically features of realistic or detailed imagery, and the design choices in Image B prioritize simplicity without detailed natural reflections.",
