    "Question": "Q4: Does the figurine retain Thor's beard and long blond hair?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine has long blond hair which is a prominent feature of Thorâ€™s character design, but no beard is visible. The presence of long blond hair aligns with common depictions of Thor but the absence of a beard suggests a deviation from some classic portrayals.

    "Question": "Q5: Does the figurine maintain the same standing pose as depicted in the original image?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the figurine in a standing position holding the hammer down and to the side with lightning effects, similar to a powerful and heroic stance, but the pose slightly differs from Image A where the arm holding the hammer is bent more at the elbow. The figurine's pose is inspired by heroic and confronting cues; however, a precise evaluation against the original would note the pose is not identical.",
