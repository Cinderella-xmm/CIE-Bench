        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure facing away from the viewer resembles a LEGO Minifigure due to its distinctive shape and design. It appears to be moving away along a street, as suggested by the perspective and orientation of the figure. The visual cues align with the spatial setting of a street environment, commonly represented in LEGO setups.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO Minifigure in Image B is holding a brown object in its right hand, which resembles a briefcase, similar to the design in Image A where a real man holds a leather briefcase. The object has a handle and rectangular shape, typical of a briefcase.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO Minifigure's torso is designed to resemble a jacket, with color and layout suggestive of denim, similar to Image A where the man is wearing a denim jacket.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a LEGO representation of a cobblestone street and buildings, as depicted by the textured base plates and brick structures on either side, reflecting Image A's real cobblestone path and buildings. The simulated LEGO environment mimics the real one by maintaining the general layout and architectural form.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The buildings in Image B, though made from LEGO bricks, reflect the general shape and arrangement of the real buildings in Image A. Even though they are stylized in a LEGO form, the relative position and overall form are intact, characterized by the distinct blocky, tiered construction associated with modular LEGO buildings.",
