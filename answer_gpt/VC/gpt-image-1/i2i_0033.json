      "question": "Does the illustration retain the man's original face shape and glasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's face appears to be covered, similar to the original image. However, based on the visible features and the style in the illustration, the general head shape including the presence of glasses is suggested, maintaining some resemblance to the original built structure. Therefore, by the deduction of visible characteristics, it's reasonable to conclude that the illustration likely retains these features.",

      "question": "Is the pattern on the tie retained in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tie has a distinct pattern with triangles and rectangles that appears to be similar to the geometric shapes seen on the tie in Image A. This consistency in design between intricate patterning suggests the illustration retains the tie's original graphic pattern.",

      "question": "Is the checkered pattern on the suit jacket retained in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit jacket is depicted in a solid color without the checkered pattern visible in Image A. The lack of this pattern in the artistic representation indicates that the texture has been simplified or altered in the illustration style, thus not retaining the checkered pattern found in the original.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress shirt beneath the suit jacket is presented with vertical intricate lines or stripes visible, similar to Image A where stripes are also apparent. This similarity shows that the striping detail of the dress shirt has been retained in the illustration.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the head features are stylized within the illustration, it suggests a similar short-cropped hairstyle as seen in the original due to the implied length and form. This element supports continuity in character depiction from Image A to the illustration.",
