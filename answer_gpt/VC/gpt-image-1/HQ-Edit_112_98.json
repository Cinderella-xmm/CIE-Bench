    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the dark brown tree branch on which the bird is perched clearly visible and positioned in the same location as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a tree branch that the bird is perched on. The coloration appears similar to dark brown, fitting typical tree branches. The positioning of the branch is central, supporting the bird, which aligns with the description given without comparing directly to Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the pink five-petaled cherry blossoms with visible yellow stamens and red centers still present in the scene, particularly near the bird and along the branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossoms have a pink color with a design that suggests multiple petals. However, the visibility of yellow stamens or distinct red centers is not apparent as they are likely stylized or replaced. Without these specific details, this does not match the description.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the bird (or its transformed spirit form) positioned on the same branch, in the same central-left location, facing toward the left side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bird in Image B is indeed positioned on a branch that is central-to-left in the image and it is facing toward the left. This aligns well with the described position, indicating that the bird's presence and orientation remain consistent.",
      "weight": 3,

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there fresh green leaves with curled tips and visible veins growing from the branches, particularly near the bird and in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, green leaves with visibly curled tips are present. Although individual veins may not be prominently detailed due to the artistic style, the leaves' positioning near the bird and in the foreground is apparent.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting suggests a warm, golden glow cast from the upper left onto the scene, creating highlights on the bird and blossoms, matching the description of sunlight's effect and direction.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B indeed features softly blurred pink cherry blossoms and branches that create a sense of depth. This layering effect behind the main subject suggests a consistency with the described background elements.",
