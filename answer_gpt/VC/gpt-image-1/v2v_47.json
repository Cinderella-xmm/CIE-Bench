      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seating is depicted as a series of concentric arcs or curves. These curves are stylized and simplified, representing a semi-circular arrangement, which is inspired by the amphitheater structure known for having semi-circular seating. Recognizing this from common depictions of amphitheaters helps confirm that the edited image maintains this feature.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the tiered wall with arches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall of the structure is illustrated with two levels of arches, creating the appearance of tiers. While the visual style is simplified and cartoonish, this indicates the presence of a tiered wall with arches, mimicking the multi-tiered design of structures like the Colosseum.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the relationship between the seating and the stage area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows a simplified stage or central area at the bottom of the semi-circular seating curves, similar to how an amphitheater typically has a stage in front of the seating. The elements are artistically reduced yet still convey the spatial relationship common to amphitheaters, where seating surrounds a central stage.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the even spacing of the arches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows arches that are consistently spaced across the tiers of the illustrated structure. Although presented in a stylized and cartoonish manner, the spacing remains notably even, echoing the regular and symmetrical spacing found in classic architectural styles.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the overall shape and outline of the amphitheater?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shape and outline of the structure is clearly reminiscent of an amphitheater or similar venue. The outer rounded form and stacked levels of arches typify this type of architecture, despite the artistic and colorful rendering. The overall essence and recognizable silhouette of an amphitheater remain intact.",
