    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the wooden surface with visible grain patterns and warm brown tones present and unaltered in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface on which the pendant rests appears to have visible grain patterns and warm brown tones, indicating a natural wooden texture. This matches the description of a wooden surface. Based on the visual cues, the wood appears to maintain its natural texture and warmth, typical of untreated wooden surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the two feather pendants positioned such that one is in the foreground and the other is partially overlapped behind it, maintaining the original diagonal alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is only one feather-shaped pendant visible, and no indication of another pendant partially overlapped behind it. Therefore, the positioning described in the question does not exist in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the pendants cast soft, consistent shadows beneath them on the wooden surface, indicating overhead lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feather pendant rests on the wooden surface with lighting that provides a subtle, consistent shadow. This suggests an overhead or diffuse light source, but since only one pendant is visible, the soft shadow pertains to this single object.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the single pendant is placed diagonally on the frame, extending from the lower-left toward the upper-right, fitting the description provided in the question.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden texture appears natural, showing grain patterns, a variety of tones, and minor imperfections typical of wood surfaces. There doesn't appear to be digital smoothing or enhancement altering its realistic appearance.",
