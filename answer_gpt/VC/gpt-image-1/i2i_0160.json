      "question": "Do the birds retain their original feather patterns including the brown and white colors and striated wing markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the birds exhibit the same feather patterns as observed in Image A. The visual cues show consistent brown and white coloration on their bodies and wings, with striated markings clearly visible. This retention of feather detail aligned with general bird anatomy knowledge confirms the consistency across the two images.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the birds still perched on the branch with their beaks open as if singing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the birds are perched on a branch with their beaks open, retaining their original posture from Image A. This visual cue suggests a continuity in their action or behavior, resembling singing, which matches the depiction commonly associated with birds' natural behavior.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the branch still present with the same structure and positioning beneath the birds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The branch in Image B maintains the same structure and position beneath the birds as in Image A. Visual comparison shows no alteration in its form or angle, indicating consistency in this part of the composition.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves near the birds retain the same shapes and positions as they appear in Image A. Their form and placement have not been altered, indicating that the structural elements of the scene have been preserved despite the background change.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the birds exhibit similar lighting effects as in Image A. The feather details and contours are highlighted effectively despite the night-time background, suggesting the lighting on them remains constant, thus ensuring that their form is well defined.",
