      "question": "Is the golden spherical knocker still present and positioned at the center of the lower half of the door?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show a wooden owl sculpture rather than a traditional door. World knowledge about doors suggests that a golden knocker is a common feature, typically positioned centrally. However, Image B does not depict a door or include any visible knocker. The design of Image B is entirely different from Image A, which does have a knocker on the door.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the intricate geometric carvings visible on both door panels, especially in the upper and lower sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central object appears to be an owl sculpture with detailed carvings, rather than door panels with geometric designs. The content and form greatly differ from Image A, which showcases geometric carvings on the door panels. Thus, the design and structure in Image B do not include door panels for such carvings.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the horizontal rows of black metal studs evenly spaced and aligned across both door panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an owl sculpture, which lacks any elements resembling door panels with studs. In Image A, such metal studs are present on the door panels, typical in historical doors for decoration. Since Image B does not constitute a door, it does not contain the described studs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the surrounding wall made of textured, earth-toned adobe with visible cracks and peeling plaster?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B encompasses an artistic representation where the owl is carved into an earthy backdrop. It lacks the realistic wall texture seen in Image A, which features adobe with cracks and peeling plaster. Image B's focus is on the sculpture's artistic style, not architectural accuracy.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a small square window with a blue mosaic tile pattern located to the right of the doorframe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents an owl sculpture within a structured arch rather than a door with adjacent architectural features. Hence, it lacks any framing or nearby window, especially a square one with mosaic tiles. Image A does have such a feature, but it is absent in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the ground composed of rectangular paving stones arranged in a herringbone pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is focused entirely on the owl sculpture integrated into a wall-like background. The visuals do not include any depiction of ground or paving stones. This distinguishes it significantly from Image A, which features such paving stones at the bottom of the door setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the door framed by a carved wooden surround with geometric borders and a flat lintel above the arch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases an owl sculpture within a geometric arch but does not resemble a traditional door frame setup as in Image A. The structure does not appear to incorporate typical architectural elements for door framing, such as flat lintels or geometric borders specifically surrounding a door.",
