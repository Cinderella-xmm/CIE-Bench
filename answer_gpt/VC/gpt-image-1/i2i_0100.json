      "question": "Are the cabinet doors and drawers designed in a shaker style in both views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cabinet doors and drawers are depicted with a simple, clean design that is characteristic of the shaker style, featuring flat panels with slight frames. This design is evident in both the top-down and side views shown in the edited image. World knowledge about shaker style, which focuses on simplicity and functionality, aligns with the visual cues such as minimalistic look in the line drawings. Thus, both views depict a shaker style for the cabinets.",

      "question": "Do both the top-down and side views show two rectangular sink basins with consistent dimensions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features two rectangular sink basins in both the top-down and side views, which appear consistent in their width and depth dimensions. While a line drawing may not show precise dimensions, the visual similarity in the sink shapes and proportions suggests that they are consistently depicted. World knowledge of geometric consistency in designs reinforces this observation.",

      "question": "Are the black faucets present above each sink basin in both views with the correct orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both views clearly depict black faucets positioned above the sink basins. The orientation of the faucets is consistent between the top-down and side views, as they are shown centered above each basin and pointing towards the interior of the sink, which is a typical practical design ensuring water flows into the basins. Visual comparison confirms the presence and correct orientation of the faucets in both views.",

      "question": "Is the countertop depicted in both views as a light-colored marble texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the material of the countertop is indicated by a line design that suggests a light-colored marble texture, aligning with the common representation of marble in line drawings as a series of flowing lines or subtle patterns. This is consistently shown in both the top-down and side views. World knowledge about marble counters, which are typically light-colored and have veining patterns, supports this visual interpretation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the compartments (drawers and cabinets) arranged in the same manner in both the top-down and side views, mirroring the original layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the top-down and side views depict a symmetrical arrangement of two cabinets flanking three centrally located drawers. This layout mirrors the original arrangement seen in the real image. The consistent portrayal of drawer and cabinet placement in both views within Image B confirms they mirror the layout as seen in the original image, aligning with common design standards for double-sink vanities.",
