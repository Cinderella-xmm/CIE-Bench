        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are shown with a posture and positioning that indicates they are skiing: they have ski poles in hand, and their stance suggests motion on skis. This aligns with common depictions of skiing activities where individuals use poles and skis to move actively on snow-covered surfaces. The vibrant attire and dynamic postures support the interpretation that these characters are engaging in skiing activity.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the characters arranged alongside each other and spread out across the snow. While not in a perfectly straight line, their positioning does suggest a group alignment typical of recreational skiing, emphasizing a collective navigation of the ski trail. A line formation is often characterized by sequential or side-by-side arrangements, which is evident here.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The characters in Image B are depicted holding ski poles, which are clearly visible, and they stand on skis, both attributes representative of skiing equipment. This use of such equipment is integral to skiing, aiding in balancing and propulsion along snowy terrain. The visual cues affirm their continued involvement in the skiing activity.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the depiction of a snowy landscape under the characters' skis. This path is identifiable as the snow-covered ground, integral to the setting where skiing occurs. Such terrain is characteristic of ski paths, operational for winter sports requiring snow, indicating a maintained background of snowy surroundings.",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are positioned in manners indicative of forward movement along the snowy path. Their orientation and postures portray forward skiing motion, as seen in the positioning of ski poles and body inclinations. This portrayal aligns with common representations of dynamic skiing motion, suggesting continuous advancement along the trail.",
