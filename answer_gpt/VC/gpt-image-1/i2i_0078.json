      ],

      "explanation": "Image B depicts the watch with a white face and distinct black hour markers, which are classic elements of many wristwatch designs to provide contrast and enhance readability.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch is not on a white surface anymore. It is placed on a wooden table within a setting resembling a vintage station. This contrasts with the typical design elements of bedrooms or modern setups which often use lighter colored surfaces. When comparing with Image A, the setting and surface have noticeably changed.",

      "question": "Are the original lighting and shadows of the watch preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a dimly lit environment with warm lighting typical of historical or vintage interiors, differing from the bright lighting of a modern room. The shadows and highlights on the watch in Image B are products of this warm, diffused lighting. This is a noticeable change from Image A, where the lighting was brighter and cast sharper shadows due to a more direct light source.",
