      "question": "Does the clock tower retain its hexagonal shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower maintains its hexagonal shape, which is apparent from the consistent angular structure around the clock face. The visual cue of the multiple visible vertical sections and angles aligns with the architecture expected from a hexagon. Therefore, the shape remains unchanged from what typically constitutes a hexagon used for clock towers.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the clock face still present with Roman numerals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a clock face with Roman numerals. The numerals I to XII encircle the clock face, which is a common design for traditional clocks. This maintains the aesthetic seen in Image A and matches the conventional style used for clock faces.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the tower still have a balcony with balusters below the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the balcony with balusters is visible beneath the clock face, suggesting a continued architectural feature typical for decorative clock towers. The balusters are identified as small vertical columns supporting a railing, which is characteristic of balconies on such structures.",

      "question": "Does the tower retain its pointed roof structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the tower with a rounded and covered roof due to snow, which diminishes its previously pointed appearance. While the underlying shape might still be pointed, the snow coverage visually alters this perception to a rounded form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the tower retain its green and yellow color scheme, excluding the flags?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color scheme in Image B is predominately muted due to snow. The tower is primarily green; however, the yellow accents have been obscured. This change results from the snow covering most areas of the tower, removing the vibrant contrast seen in Image A.",
