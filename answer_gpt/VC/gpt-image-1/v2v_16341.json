      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child is running forward through a shallow puddle, splashing water as they move, which indicates movement and playful interaction with the water.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two adults are depicted in an affectionate stance, closely holding each other. Their posture suggests movement typical of dancing or swaying together, which is a common way to show embrace in visual scenes.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an older man visible in the background who is holding a cane.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman near the child does not hold an umbrella. Her stance suggests walking more casually without the protective posture generally indicated by holding an umbrella. The absence of the umbrella aligns with the shift from a rainy to a sunny setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Facial expressions of characters are typically discernible through their demeanor and body language. Image B does not feature the same expressions as Image A; changes in setting, lighting, and activities often lead to changes in expressions. As the faces are blurred, we infer from the change in activities, attire, and environment that expressions are likely different.",
