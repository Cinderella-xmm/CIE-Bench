        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'STORY PAGES' is visible at the base of the object and not positioned above the book within the snowglobe.

However, the font style matches the description.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a book within a snow globe where the book is open and features two visible cover edges, creating an open structure. The spine of the book is implied as the book appears open, but there's no visible spine in the depiction since the book is shown inside a snowglobe, and the spine is not directly visible.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book inside the snow globe showcases multiple curved horizontal lines on both sides, imitating the appearance of stacked pages. Each side of the open book has these lines, suggesting the presence of pages.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The book in Image B is placed within a snow globe and is not centered horizontally and vertically beneath the text 'STORY PAGES'. The text 'STORY PAGES' is located on the base of the snow globe, not directly above the book. Hence, the book and the text do not follow a direct center placement.",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the book inside the snow globe and the text 'STORY PAGES' are rendered in different colors. The text 'STORY PAGES' is shown in gold or brass color on a wooden base, while the book is a beige-like color inside the snow globe filled with snowflakes and a warm lighting background, unlike a light beige background with dark navy blue render.",
