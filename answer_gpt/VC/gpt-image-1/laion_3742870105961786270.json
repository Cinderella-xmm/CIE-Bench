      "question": "Is the cluster of purple grapes visible in the basket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle design does not feature a visible basket; instead, there is a design on the bottle that resembles grapes. Therefore, no cluster of purple grapes is visible in a basket as the item held by the woman is set in a different form in this image.",

      "question": "Is the heart-shaped engraving present on the small terracotta jug?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a perfume bottle shaped as a woman's figure, including a goose attachment but does not feature any jug nor any heart-shaped engravings distinctly visible.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the goose depicted with a white body, orange beak, and webbed feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the goose is represented as part of the perfume bottle design with its figure being entirely gold-toned as is the entire bottle, including the attached chain. Therefore, it lacks the specific colors: white body, orange beak, and webbed feet.",
      "weight": 3,

      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a gold-colored clasp visible at the neckline of the cloak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not exhibit any cloak or gold-colored clasp since the design is primarily focused on the perfume bottle upon which only the woman's figure is crafted. The concept of a cloak or clasp does not visually translate here.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering Image B, there is no basket holding fruits in the perfume bottle design, only ornamented grape patterns appear on the bottle itself.",

      "question": "Is the basket positioned near the womanâ€™s waist, held in her left arm?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a perfume bottle shaped as a woman's upper body but features no basket. Consequently, there is no basket visible near the waist or held by the woman's left arm.",
