      "question": "Are both the main triangular sail and the smaller jib sail present and correctly positioned on the mast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two sails that can be observed: a large main sail and a smaller jib sail, both attached to the mast. The positioning and shape of these sails are consistent with common sail configurations, with the main sail being larger and main triangular in shape, while the jib sail is smaller. Thus, both sails are present and correctly positioned on the mast.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a single vertical mast located centrally along the length of the boat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual information from Image B shows a single vertical mast positioned centrally along the length of the boat, typical for boats of this type. Its placement aligns with the center of the deck area.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the boat have a sharply pointed bow extending forward from the hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a boat with a prominently pointed bow extending forward from the hull. This feature is a characteristic of many traditional sailboats for cutting through water efficiently.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a covered section with open sides and vertical railings located over the midsection of the hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a structure located over the midsection of the hull, which appears to be covered and has open sides with vertical railings, resembling designs found on boats for open deck areas used for leisure or observation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the entire boat, but no red flag is visible attached to the stern of the boat. This suggests that either there is no flag or it is not depicted clearly.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the sails, mast, deck, and bow aligned in their original spatial configuration, maintaining the correct proportions and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When comparing Image A with Image B, it seems that the spatial configuration is consistent across both images. The proportions and orientations of the sails, mast, deck, and bow are aligned, indicating that the edited image maintains the original layout of these elements. Both images depict a similar arrangement in terms of how these features relate spatially to one another.",
