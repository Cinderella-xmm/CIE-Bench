      "question": "Is the U.S. $20 bill with its distinctive green color, \"20\" numeral, and architectural design visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a stylized graphical representation of currencies rather than actual detailed portrayals. The artwork shows generic bills without specific details like color or design elements of actual U.S. currency. The denominations '1', '10', and '40' are mentioned, which don't correspond correctly with the usual denominations for U.S. dollars. Therefore, the U.S. $20 bill, as described with its distinguishing features, is not discernible in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the Qatari Riyal note with its pink-orange hue, Arabic script, and serial number \"103 01\" present and recognizable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, currencies are represented graphically without specific real-world details like color or inscriptions. The edited image contains illustrations labeled usch, but without discernable colors or text such as a serial number. Therefore, the details indicating a Qatari Riyal note with a specific hue and script are not recognizable.",

      "question": "Is the Indian Rupee 50 note with the lion capital symbol and yellow-brown color clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not detail any unique elements of the Indian Rupee, nor are there colors that match the relevant characteristics like yellow-brown. The image is a simple graphic representation lacking specific note features. Hence, the Indian Rupee 50 note with its specific traits is not clearly visible.",

      "question": "Is the U.S. $1 bill with the portrait of George Washington and \"ONE DOLLAR\" text present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents currencies as illustrative graphics without distinct features such as portraits or inscriptions. While 'USD 1 US Dollar' is written, it's a textual reference rather than a depiction of the actual $1 bill. The classic depiction with George Washington is absent.",

      "question": "Are all four banknotes (U.S. $20, Qatari Riyal, Indian Rupee 50, U.S. $1) present together in the same visual space?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a schema of currency without distinct, identifiable banknotes. It lacks specific details that would confirm the presence of these four banknotes together, as they are visually abstracted to generic bill shapes without detailed characteristics.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the original dominant colors of the banknotes (green for USD, pink-orange for QAR, yellow-brown for INR) preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the representation omits specific colors, using a monochromatic scheme for illustration purposes. This omits the traditional color coding of the original banknotes. Therefore, the original dominant colors are not maintained.",
