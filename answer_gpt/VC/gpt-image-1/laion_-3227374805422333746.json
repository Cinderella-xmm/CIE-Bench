        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the visual structure of the building still features a three-part gabled roof which includes a central tower and two side sections. This basic architectural form appears unchanged when juxtaposed with world knowledge of typical building structures and roof styles. When compared to Image A, it is evident that Image B maintains this same structural arrangement.",
