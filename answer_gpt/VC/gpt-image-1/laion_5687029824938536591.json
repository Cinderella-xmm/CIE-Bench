        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the triangular panel structure on the shoe appears to be preserved in shape and spatial arrangement as it mirrors the geometric design seen in typical shoes. This conclusion is drawn by comparing the observed visual cues with common knowledge of shoe designs that feature these elements for structural support and style, similar to those found in original Salomon shoes.",
