      "question": "Does the guitar retain its teal color and circular sound hole?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar maintains a teal color similar to the one in Image A, which is a unique and vibrant shade of blue-green. The circular sound hole is still present in Image B, consistent with the design of a typical acoustic guitar. This conclusion is drawn from the visual inspection of the guitar's body, confirming that its essential features remain unchanged.",

      "question": "Are there still six tuning pegs on the guitar's headstock?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar's headstock exhibits six tuning pegs, which is a standard feature for most acoustic guitars. This observation requires counting the visible tuning pegs, confirming that the guitar maintains the same number of tuning pegs as conventional designs typically require for adjusting the tension of the six strings.",

      "question": "Is the microphone still positioned near the guitar?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the microphone is positioned in close proximity to the guitar, suggesting that its placement remains unchanged from Image A. The spatial arrangement indicates the microphone's function, likely to capture sound from the guitar when played, and the physical closeness corroborates this usage.",

      "question": "Is the amplifier still placed behind the guitar?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the amplifier is situated directly behind the guitar, similarly to its original setup in Image A. The spatial orientation and arrangement of the objects suggest the amplifier's role as a backdrop and an audio output device for the guitar sound, supporting the idea that its placement has not been altered.",

      "question": "Does the guitar maintain its original leaning posture against the amplifier?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar is illustrated with an anthropomorphic and upright posture rather than leaning. In Image A, the guitar was seen in a typical leaning position against the amplifier. This change suggests a shift in presentation style, likely for the purpose of giving the guitar a characterful appearance rather than maintaining a realistic stance.",
