      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bed is depicted prominently, similar to Image A, occupying the central position in the illustration. The visual cues include the drawn bed with pillows and a blanket, which are key characteristics that identify the bed as the central object in both images.

      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lamp and candles are shown with faces and bright orange tones, which resemble a warm glow similar to what candles and lamps emit in Image A.

        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses illustrative features such as orange color and simple drawn lines to mimic the look of soft bedding seen in Image A. While the texture is abstracted in the cartoon style of Image B, it still suggests comfort and softness through its design, which is a reflection of the visual warmth and texture found in Image A's bedding.",

      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two cartoon-style pillows with smiles arranged side by side on the bed, matching the positioning observed in Image A. Although the style has been altered to symbols, the positioning reflects the usual arrangement of pillows, showcasing recognition of original layout from Image A.",

      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "The bedside table in Image B is positioned next to the bed, similar to the table in Image A, featuring a lamp with a face and a small candle-like object. Despite the cartoonish illustration, these elements follow the spatial arrangement found in the original image, indicating awareness of furniture positioning.",
