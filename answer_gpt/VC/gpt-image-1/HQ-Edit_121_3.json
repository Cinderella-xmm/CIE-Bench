    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the central flower beneath the butterfly a pink coneflower with a prominent spiky central cone and drooping pink petals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central flower beneath the butterfly-like structure has pink petals and a prominent central cone. However, the central cone does not have a spiky appearance, and instead, the structure above it resembles a stylized butterfly formed from leaves and flower petals rather than a real butterfly. The flower itself is stylized and less naturalistic compared to a traditional pink coneflower with a spiky central cone.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the butterfly positioned directly above the central cone of the flower, with its body aligned vertically over it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly-like figure is created by leaves and petals stemming from the central flower, giving the appearance of wings. The structure is symmetrical and vertically aligned over the central flower, similar to the previous image, but is not a real butterfly.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there tall golden grasses and additional pink coneflowers visible in the background behind the main flower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a background with many flowers that resemble pink coneflowers and tall grasses. These elements create a naturalistic flower field scene, although they are stylized.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sky a pale blue with soft white clouds and a warm golden light illuminating the meadow from below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is depicted as a pale blue color, with suggestions of soft clouds, and the lighting throughout the scene has a warm, golden quality, which creates a similar mood to a meadow illuminated by golden light.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small clusters of purple wildflowers and pink spiky blooms visible among the grasses in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are various floral elements and grasses that add complexity to the background, and some of them could be interpreted as small clusters of different wildflowers. The scene is stylized but these elements are visible.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the central cone of the flower have a spiky, bristly texture made of densely packed dark-tipped florets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central cone of the flower in Image B does not appear to have a spiky, bristly texture. It lacks the detailed texture of densely packed dark-tipped florets and seems more stylized and smooth compared to the actual spiky texture of a traditional coneflower.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the petals of the central flower curve downward and have a smooth, elongated shape with a soft pink hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the petals of the central flower do curve downward and have a smooth and elongated shape with a soft pink hue, similar to how flower petals naturally appear, though they are represented in a stylized manner.",
