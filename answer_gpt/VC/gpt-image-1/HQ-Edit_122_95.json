    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there two female figures present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see two figures dressed in attire appearing to represent historical or cultural figures typically embodied as female. The way they are posed and their features suggest they are intended to be female figures, based on the visual representation of similar figures in art and cultural contexts.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the two figures positioned symmetrically relative to the central axis of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the two figures placed symmetrically on either side of the central pathway, consistent with the composition of many traditional and cultural artworks where figures are balanced around a central focal point.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a large central dome visible at the end of the pathway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the figures and background in Image B are represented in a mosaic style, the central structure does feature a dome, which is central at the end of the pathway, reminiscent of classical structures often depicted in mosaics and known for their domed architecture.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there an arched stone entrance framing the view of the central structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain an exact arched stone entrance like in traditional architecture photographs. Instead, the mosaic encompasses arches integrated into the design above the figures, suggesting a stylized entry, which is often seen in traditional art.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a straight water channel running from the foreground to the central structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display a straightforward representation of a water channel like in the original architectural setting. Instead, creativity in the design of the path within the mosaic suggests a different artistic interpretation rather than a literal water feature.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the sarees retain a dominant red and gold color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The outfits in Image B feature a dominant red and gold color scheme with intricate patterns and embellishments, which is common in representations of regal or historical attire in both Indian cultural attire and mosaic artwork.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are gold jewelry pieces, including a forehead ornament (maang tikka) and earrings, visible on both figures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mosaic style suggests ornate dress, but specific jewelry items like earrings or a maang tikka are not distinctly visible due to the nature of the art form concentrating on garment detail rather than accessories.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Do both figures have long, dark hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the representation in mosaic art does not distinctly show detailed attributes like hair color and length. The figures have hair forms consistent with many historical and cultural mosaics but without clear color or detailed depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
