    "Question": "Q1: Is the curved side profile of the grand piano preserved, maintaining its characteristic gentle arc and elongated form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the main object is a cosmetics display resembling a piano, complete with cosmetic items such as an eyeshadow palette in place of the keyboard and other makeup items. By recognition, a grand piano is elongated with a curved edge. In Image B, the cosmetics setup does not include a piano or maintain any elongated, curved form. Therefore, the curved side profile of the grand piano is not preserved.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the four tapered legs with decorative casters present and positioned beneath the piano body as in the original?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a cosmetics display sitting on a platform instead of a piano with legs. World knowledge suggests piano legs are typically tapered with decorative end casters, but the cosmetics display lacks this detail, being supported by a boxy platform without visible decorative features.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the piano positioned directly in the center of the corridor, aligned with the vanishing point created by the columns?",
    "explanation": "Observing Image B, the cosmetics display is centered in the corridor, consistent with the columns' symmetrical arrangement. World knowledge of perspective indicates alignment with a vanishing point requires centralized positioning. The display aligns with the vanishing central corridor, fulfilling this requirement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the floor composed of large square tiles arranged in a repeating pattern of alternating dark and light shades?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the floor consists of evenly shaded large tiles, recognizable by their consistency in color without variation. Common tile patterns might alternate colors, but Image B does not display any shade differences or repeated patterns of dark and light tiles.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there tall, evenly spaced white columns extending along both sides of the corridor, forming a symmetrical passage?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays tall white columns spaced equally along each side of the corridor. These uniform columns contribute to a symmetrical passage view, typical in architectural designs. The symmetrical appearance is clear from the alignment and spacing.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the piano retain a highly reflective, glossy black surface that mirrors the surrounding environment?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a glossy black platform displaying cosmetics. Unlike a piano, which is known for its reflective surface, Image B's display texture appears glossy yet shows no direct reflections, indicating it lacks a highly reflective quality as seen in a polished piano finish.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are soft shadows cast beneath the piano and along the floor, consistent with overhead lighting from above?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are soft shadows under the cosmetics display, a common result of overhead lighting similar to shadows beneath a piano. Shadows help convey depth and lighting direction, present here from presumably above the corridor, as expected.",
    "answer": "Yes"
