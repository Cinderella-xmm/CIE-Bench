      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant-themed teapot has a prominent head section which is shaped like an elephant. The head features large, flared ears and visible eyes which are distinctly crafted. The design is clear enough for the elephant's characteristic facial features to be recognized, combining visual cues with common knowledge about elephant anatomy.",

      "question": "Is the trunk of the elephant clearly formed into the spout of the teapot, extending upward and backward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's trunk is intricately formed into the spout of the teapot. It extends upward and slightly backward, mimicking the natural curvature of an elephant's trunk. This design is consistent with how spouts are typically incorporated into thematic teapots providing function alongside design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot is designed to resemble an elephant with four distinct legs visible. These legs are formed in a manner similar to how an elephant stands, providing stable support for the teapot's body. This detail showcases both aesthetic design and structural integrity common in animal-themed ceramic or metallic works.",

      "question": "Is there a domed lid with a pointed finial on top of the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The teapot in Image B displays a domed lid, which is a common feature in teapot design, indicating where the tea can be poured in and sealed. On top of this lid, there's a pointed finial, which adds to the stylistic design and serves as a handle for removing the lid. The shape and placement are consistent with world knowledge of traditional lids.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are floral patterns, including lotus flowers and vines, visibly engraved on the body of the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot has gear patterns rather than floral motifs. The design is focused on mechanical elements which are prominent, departing from the traditional floral engravings, such as lotus flowers and vines, often seen in ornate teapot designs. This reveals a different thematic choice.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a teapot with a bronze or copper finish, showcasing an industrial, steampunk-like design rather than a silver metallic one. The coloring and texture are designed to appear rustic and mechanical, differing from the silver, highly reflective surfaces that would characterize traditional ornate metallic teapot designs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a cup and saucer are present and match the bronze aesthetic of the teapot, rather than a silver finish. They are positioned near the teapot, adhering to the steampunk theme with similar metallic accents, which indicates cohesion in the styled set.",
