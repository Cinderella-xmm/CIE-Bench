    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the model’s original facial features, including dark eyes, defined cheekbones, and full lips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the face is stylized in an art deco illustration manner, which differs significantly from photographic facial features. This style does not present realistic facial features like dark eyes, defined cheekbones, or full lips, instead uses stylized, minimalistic lines consistent with the genre. Therefore, the answer is based on reasonable world knowledge understanding of art styles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the model’s long, straight black hair parted down the middle still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features short, stylized hair resembling the art deco period's style, which is distinctly different from the long, straight black hair seen in Image A. This conclusion combines the visual details with common knowledge on art illustration styles.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the model in the illustration has a silver choker necklace around their neck. This matches the accessory's description, suggesting retention in the edited image as expected.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the model has one hand on the hip, which deviates from the original hand positions at the waist, but maintains an upright stance with legs together. The stance is altered, especially regarding the hands' placement, when compared to Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the model uses one hand to hold a decorative object, and the other is placed on the hip, which differs from Image A's hand positioning at the waist holding a chain handle. World knowledge about posing and object engagements helps deduce this difference.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image represents the model in stylized art rather than realistic skin tones and body proportions. This simplifies details typical of illustration compared to the photographic quality of Image A. World knowledge on artistic representations confirms these changes.",
