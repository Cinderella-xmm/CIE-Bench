    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the two garage doors positioned side by side on the lower front portion of the cabin, directly beneath the large upper window section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower front portion of the cabin has an area that could resemble entrances or doors, but they do not appear to be conventional garage doors like in Image A. There seems to be a transformation with roots and vines, obscuring what might traditionally be classified as garage doors, and the large upper window section seen in Image A is replaced with tree and eye-like features. Hence, these elements do not confirm a conventional garage door setup as described.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a large, multi-pane window section with exposed wooden beams located directly above the two garage doors, spanning most of the front width of the cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not visibly display a large, multi-pane window section as described. Instead, there appears to be a transformation where the upper part of the cabin resembles eyes surrounded by roots and vines, which could symbolize windows but do not match the description of a large multi-pane window with exposed wooden beams.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a small rectangular window cut into the log wall on the left side of the cabin, near the front corner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A has a small rectangular window visible on the left side of the cabin. In Image B, this area is covered by trees and roots, and no small rectangular window is visible on the left side near the front corner.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a doorway located immediately to the right of the small rectangular window on the left side of the cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A shows a doorway beside the window on the left side of the cabin. However, Image B lacks a visible doorway at this location; the door and window are not represented distinctly. The area appears overgrown and transformed with natural elements such as roots and vines.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a continuous concrete foundation base running beneath the log walls of the cabin, visible along the lower perimeter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A depicts a concrete foundation running beneath the cabin structure. In Image B, this foundation is entirely obscured by the transformation into forest-like elements; no concrete base is visible under the cabin's perimeter.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the cabin oriented such that its front fa√ßade is angled slightly toward the right side of the image, with the left side receding into the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the cabin is positioned with the front facade slightly angled toward the camera from the right, with the left side receding. Image B maintains this orientation, as the transformation still reflects the angle of the structure.",
