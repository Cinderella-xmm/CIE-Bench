    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the central waterfall positioned vertically in the middle of the image, descending from the upper cliff to the river below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central waterfall is prominently cascading from the upper portion of the image vertically in the middle, extending downwards to the floor, mimicking a descending motion. The arrangement of the images and light effects suggests a natural waterfall descending direction. Although this occurs within a mirrored room that gives the waterfall a somewhat digital or futuristic appearance, the visual cues affirm a vertical central positioning.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a large, curved tree on the left side of the image with a diagonal branch extending upward and bearing clusters of small purple flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a prominent tree on the left side, characterized by its winding and curved structure. This tree features diagonal branches that extend outward. The tree is illuminated with an array of glowing colors and digital effects, including purplish tones. However, it bears no explicit clusters of small purple flowers upon close inspection, but rather colorful digital glowing particles.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the river originate in the foreground and curve toward the base of the central waterfall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a digital representation of water descending vertically rather than an originating river. The environment is made up of mirrored walls and floors, reflecting a waterfall, but no traditional river curves into the waterfall scene. This setup is more artificial and technological in essence than natural.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible rocks scattered along the riverbed in the foreground and midground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene consists of digitally and geometrically framed waterfalls with no traditional riverbed and no visible rocks. The area is technologically simulated rather than naturally occurring. The glowing elements suggest digital enhancements rather than natural rock formations.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there two smaller waterfalls visible on the right-hand cliff face, behind the main waterfall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of cliff faces and naturally occurring waterfalls, there is a single main digital cascade waterfall. There are no additional waterfalls on the right or any indicative cliff formation that could host them, as this is technologically depicted.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a dense canopy at the top of the image with sunlight streaming through gaps, creating bright patches on the foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no foliage or dense canopy visible, and certainly no sunlight streaming through gaps as it mainly features waterfalls in a digital format within a mirrored setup.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there small purple flowers growing on the left side of the twisted tree, near the base of its branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left tree is covered in digital lights. Although there are glowing purplish areas reminiscent of flowers, there are no clear sections of traditional flower growth. The depiction leans more toward an illuminated or neon-like structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there multiple mountain ridges receding into the background, fading into a hazy blue sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is enclosed in a mirrored digital room with a focus on technological enhancements creating waterfall visuals. The background does not feature mountain ridges or open sky. Instead, the ceiling patterns make the enclosed area appear futuristic.",
