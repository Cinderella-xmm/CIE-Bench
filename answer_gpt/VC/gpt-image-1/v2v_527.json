      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'STOP' is traditionally white and situated within stop signs for high visibility. Image B upholds this standard with the stop sign clearly displaying white 'STOP' text aligned with commonly known design principles for such signage.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
