      "question": "Is the toilet still predominantly white in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the toilet retains its predominantly white color, which is a typical color for toilets designed to convey cleanliness and hygiene. This was evident from the visible sections of the toilet, including the bowl, lid, and flush tank. Knowing the common color schemes for bathroom fittings, white remains the most prevalent color, signifying that the edited image has not altered this aspect.",

      "question": "Is the toilet lid still open?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toilet lid remains in an upright position, appearing open. The open lid is a typical state, often indicating readiness for use. This perception results from observing its position relative to the toilet seat surface, where it stands perpendicular rather than laying flat or closed.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the flush tank still attached to the wall above the toilet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the flush tank directly behind the toilet bowl, mounted against the wall, as would typically be observed in standard toilet designs for compact restroom setups. This placement allows for effective installation and use, with the tank's placement against the tiles clearly present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In analyzing Image B, the floor and walls indeed continue to display the presence of gray square tiles. Such tiling is common in bathrooms due to its water-resistant nature and easy cleaning ability. This same tiling was evident through the consistency of color and form, maintaining the aesthetics and function standard.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the toilet remains visibly installed in the corner of the room, as suggested by the converging pattern of the surrounding tiled walls. This configuration optimizes the space and is typical in smaller bathrooms to maximize accessibility and layout efficiency.",
