      "question": "Does the elderly man retain his white hair and mustache?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly man is partially visible from the side; we can observe his white hair, but the area where a mustache would be is obscured by the blur. Based on typical depictions of elderly gentlemen with a similar appearance, it is reasonable to assume he may have a mustache. Without explicit visual evidence of a mustache in Image B, we rely more on contextual clues than direct observation.",

      "question": "Does the pineapple retain its spiky green leaves and textured golden-brown skin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pineapple's appearance is clear, displaying its characteristic spiky green leaves and textured golden-brown skin. These features are commonly associated with pineapples and are clearly visible in the image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the elderly man still gazing contemplatively toward the pineapple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the direction of the elderly man's gaze isn't visible due to the blurred face, but his body orientation suggests a forward-facing position, similar to typical portrait compositions where a subject might be looking at an object of interest. Thus, it can be reasonably inferred that he is still gazing toward the pineapple.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B continues to exhibit warm lighting and shadows on both the man and the pineapple, as indicated by the tonal warmth and the gradient of shadows present around and on these subjects. This lighting creates a cohesive atmospheric effect.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spatial relationship between the man and the pineapple is maintained, with the pineapple clearly positioned to the right of the man. This continuity preserves the original arrangement seen in such images.",
