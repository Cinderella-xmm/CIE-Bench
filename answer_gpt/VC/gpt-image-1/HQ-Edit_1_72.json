      "question": "Does the edited image retain the original subject’s facial features, including the shape of the nose, lips, eyes, and skin tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features have been blurred to the extent that specific details such as the nose, lips, eyes, and skin tone are no longer discernible. Without these details, it cannot be concluded that Image B retains the original facial features. Therefore, the answer to whether the facial features remain as in Image A is No.",

      "question": "Is the central V-neck pattern with diamond motifs clearly visible on the Dashiki in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central V-neck pattern is visible, with intricate designs that suggest diamond motifs, which are considered characteristic of Dashiki designs. Observing the sharpness of these patterns allows us to acknowledge their presence. Thus, based on the design features visible, the answer is Yes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom hem of the Dashiki does not show tassels like those in Image A. In Image A, tassels are discernible at the hem, whereas in Image B, there are none, with the hem instead showing geometric designs. Hence, the answer is No.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Images A and B depict the subject with hands clasped together at waist level. The positioning of the hands is consistent in both images, supporting the retention of this pose in Image B. Thus, the answer is Yes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground does not exhibit tall golden grass around the subject's lower body as Image A does. Instead, Image B has a more unified texture and color scheme without visible tall grass structures. Therefore, the answer is No.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and B show trees in the background featuring flat-topped canopies, which are characteristic of acacia trees often found in savanna landscapes. Thus, the trees in Image B can be identified as acacia trees present as in Image A. The answer is Yes.",
      "weight": 2,

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hair maintains a similar appearance to that in Image A, featuring a short, curly, and voluminous texture. Observing consistency in hair style between the images leads to the conclusion that the hair texture is retained in Image B. The answer is Yes.",
