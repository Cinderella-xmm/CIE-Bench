      "question": "Is there a female figure wearing a full-length kimono with a long trailing sleeve and wide hem?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is depicted in a traditional Japanese kimono with distinct features. The kimono is full-length, extending all the way to the ground. The hem of the kimono is wide, and the sleeves are trailing, which are common characteristics of a kimono. This portrayal aligns with the visual style often found in Japanese artwork or illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the figure positioned with her body angled to the right and her head turned back toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's body is facing forward along the path, and her head is angled slightly away, not back towards the viewer. The positioning suggests she's looking ahead rather than turning her head back. This stance in art often communicates serenity as the figure is depicted in harmony with the path, focusing on the journey.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a straight stone-paved path bordered by evenly spaced cylindrical wooden posts on both sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a straight path made of stone pavement. On both sides of this path are cylindrical wooden posts that are evenly spaced. This setup is consistent with many aesthetic designs found in garden and path landscapes, where the posts serve as stylistic elements providing rhythm and structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there cherry blossom trees forming an arching canopy overhead with dense pink blooms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows cherry blossom trees casting a canopy overhead, and the trees are illustrated with dense, stylized blooms. These trees are depicted in an arching formation, common in illustrations to imply a natural covering or shelter with their soft blossoms.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there fallen cherry blossom petals scattered along the edges of the path and surrounding grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible fallen cherry blossom petals scattered along the path or the grass, unlike what might be expected during a cherry blossom season in a realistic setting. The visual focus is more on the standing blossoms and structured elements rather than scattered details.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the path extends straight into the background, contributing to a sense of depth in the image. There is no softly glowing misty distance evident; the path appears more flat and stylized without gradient features suggesting mist or glow.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a floral ornament, specifically a cluster of pink cherry blossoms and golden details, in the figureâ€™s hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does show a floral ornament in the figure's hair, but the details are not specifically outlined as pink cherry blossoms or gold. The ornamentation is consistent with traditional hairpieces often seen in portrayals of figures in kimonos, adding elegance and cultural authenticity.",
