      "question": "Is the background composed of vertical wooden planks with patches of peeling red paint?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of vertical wooden planks with visible peeling red paint. This can be identified by observing the texture and color disintegration on the surface of the planks, typical signs of aging paint. Based on common sense and world knowledge, such patterns indicate an old, weathered wall.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floorboards made of rough, aged wood with visible grain and gaps between planks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floorboards exhibit a texture that suggests rough, aged wood, showing distinct wood grain and gaps between the planks. These characteristics are visible as natural wood aging processes and are generally found in older, worn flooring.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a red circular reflector attached to the rear fender near the wheel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's no visible red circular reflector on any mechanical or insect-like object. The edited image features an insect with clock-like structures but lacks traditional bicycle features such as a reflector. Thus, the absence of a red reflector is evident.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a wire mesh basket mounted on the front handlebars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a mechanical insect with no handlebars or bicycle components like a wire mesh basket. Instead, its structure mimics an insect with complex metallic details, indicating the absence of any basket-related features.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a metal luggage rack mounted above the rear wheel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object present is a mechanical insect, not a bicycle, so there is no rear wheel or luggage rack. While Image A might have these features, the edited content of Image B portrays a distinct insect design, precluding any such bicycle accessories.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are soft shadows cast by the bicycle onto the wall and floor, indicating directional lighting from the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanical insect casts shadows rather than a bicycle, but the image does show soft shadows implying directional lighting. However, since this image does not contain a bicycle, the specific detail of the shadow being cast by a bicycle is not applicable.",
