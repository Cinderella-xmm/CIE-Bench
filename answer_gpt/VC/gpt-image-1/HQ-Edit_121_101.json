      "question": "Are the floral embroidery patterns on the sleeves and collar of the hanbok clearly visible and in their original positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hanbok designs are stylized as illustrations on stamps, depicting floral patterns on the sleeves of each hanbok design. These illustrations seem uniform and are rendered in a simplified artistic style, which means the embroidery is represented differently compared to the original details. Thus, the clarity and positioning as they were in Image A are altered due to the artistic style.",

      "question": "Is the jeogori light pink and the chima sky-blue in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color scheme has been altered significantly. The hanbok on the stamps is colored in shades of golden yellow and brown, unlike the original pink and blue. This indicates a change from the original vibrant colors to a more subdued, uniform palette used in the decorative stamp designs.",

      "question": "Is there a golden-yellow ribbon tied in a bow at the center of the chest on the jeogori?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hanbok designs on the stamps include illustrations of a golden-yellow ribbon tied at the chest area, maintaining the tie style seen in traditional hanbok. However, the style and color are part of the artistic design, which are commonly used to illustrate hanbok.",

      "question": "Is the background a traditional Korean palace with multiple curved roofs, red pillars, and green decorative beams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is an artistic interpretation that includes elements of a traditional Korean palace with stylized representations of the curved roofs seen behind each hanbok illustration on the stamps. This depiction is consistent in shape but rendered in accordance with the stamp's design framework.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features hanbok designs on stamps but does not depict any specific hairstyle details due to the lack of facial features on the avatars. As a result, the information about the woman's hair styled in an updo with silver hairpins is not present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hanbok-wearing figures on the stamps do not display any facial features or accessories such as earrings. The focus is solely on the hanbok, making it impossible to discern whether dangling earrings were depicted.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the designs represent hanbok on stamps without additional accessories such as bags. The artistic representation is focused on traditional attire, thus the crossbody bag seen in Image A is absent.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the designs on the stamps illustrate hanbok attire, and the figures depicted are styled without facial features or detailed posturing, leading to the absence of positioning information. Moreover, each stamp features a front-facing perspective, but they do not show a real landscape orientation or precise positioning relative to the palace.",
