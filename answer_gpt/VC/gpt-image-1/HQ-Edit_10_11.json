      "question": "Is the gorilla depicted in a seated pose with its left hand resting under its chin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla is etched onto the surface, and its pose shows the body in a seated position with its left hand under its chin, a thoughtful pose often associated with gorillas. The visual cues in the carved image show the outlined position of the hand in relation to the chin, consistent with a seated thinking pose.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the gorilla have a prominent brow ridge, wide nose, and strong jawline consistent with a silverback gorilla?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the carved depiction simplifies these features due to its artistic nature. However, carved gorillas frequently showcase key identifiers like a prominent brow ridge, a wide nose, and a strong jawline, which are typical features of a silverback gorilla. These cues are common in stylized representations of gorillas.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a distinct patch resembling a silver saddle located across the back and shoulders of the gorilla?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artistic style of carving does not include distinct colorations like a silver saddle which is characteristic of a silverback gorilla. Instead, the focus is on form and texture rather than color differences.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the gorilla positioned on a horizontal surface that resembles a log or platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the gorilla sitting on a carved section that distinctly looks like a horizontal log or platform, which is a common element in depictions of gorillas in nature, often used to add context and environment.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the gorilla’s right arm resting on its right knee?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carved gorilla's pose indeed shows the right arm bent with the hand resting on its knee, a pose consistent with the resting position of gorillas.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the gorilla’s gaze directed forward and slightly downward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given the style of carving in Image B, while detailed facial features are abstracted, the pose of the head in alignment with the body's leaning suggests a forward and slightly downward gaze, typical of a pensive position.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there leaf-shaped elements present in the background, even if stylized or etched?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are clear, stylized etchings of leaves in the background, which support the naturalistic theme of the image and contribute to its depiction of a forested environment.",
