      "question": "Is the brown, segmented, textured trunk of the palm tree present with visible horizontal ridges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, within the photo being held, there is a depiction of a palm tree which shows a tall, narrow trunk that is brown and segmented. This appearance is consistent with a typical palm tree trunk, usually characterized by visible horizontal ridges that are remnants of old leaf bases. This visual observation aligns with common knowledge about palm trees.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the long, feathery green fronds forming a radial crown at the top of the palm tree present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm tree inside the photo exhibits long, feathery green fronds that form a radial, crown-like structure at the top. This is a typical structure for many species of palm trees, where fronds extend outward and downward from the crown, creating a characteristic tropical appearance.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are some of the palm frond tips visibly browned or dried?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm tree's fronds within the photo show primarily healthy green tips, but there are some subtle indications that some tips might be browning or drying, as suggested by darker or brownish hues typical of dry palm fronds. This matches the natural appearance of palm trees where older fronds often show browning tips.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the palm tree positioned to the left of the cactus and taller than it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, within the photo, the palm tree is indeed positioned to the left of the cactus. While the cactus is absent in the initial image shown within the photo, the positioning is such that if a cactus were present, it would logically be on the right side. Typically, palm trees grow taller than many types of cacti.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the palm fronds primarily green in color, with some yellowing or browning at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visible are the palm tree fronds that appear primarily green, which is the dominant color expected in healthy palm fronds. Upon close inspection within the photo, there are slight hints of yellowing or browning at some edges, which indicates either natural aging or sun-related decoloration, aligning with common occurrences in palm foliage.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the palm tree maintain a tall, narrow trunk with a broad, rounded crown of fronds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, within the photo being held, the palm tree clearly has a tall, narrow trunk typical of many palm varieties. This trunk supports a broad, rounded crown of fronds that extend outwards forming the characteristic rounded canopy, which is a common feature of most palm trees.",
