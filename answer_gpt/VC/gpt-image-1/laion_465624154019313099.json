        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake is represented by a cartoonish character with rounded features on top. The illustration style conveys a representation similar to the grid of yellow rounded domes seen on cakes, indicating the presence of these elements.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a simplified style to depict the cake character, without intricate details such as small red dots. The focus is on the abstract representation, so the small red dots seen in the realistic version of a cake like Image A might not be illustrated in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a silver-toned plate or floral pattern as it is a cartoon, focusing on the character itself rather than extraneous elements like plates and surfaces.",
