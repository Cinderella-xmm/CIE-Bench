      "question": "Is the McLaren logo clearly visible on the center of the car's hood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car's hood is visible, but the logo appears very small and indistinct, making it difficult to clearly identify. The car is encased in a glass cube, indicating it is a scaled model or representation. A logo would be present in the original design, but its visibility in Image B is not clear due to scale and lighting conditions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the headlights shaped in a narrow, curved, and horizontally elongated design with internal LED strips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the headlights are visible and appear to have a curved and horizontally elongated design. They are meticulously detailed, suggesting internal LED strip-like features, typical of modern sports cars as seen in model versions as well.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the brake calipers behind the front wheels colored bright orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, showcasing the car within a glass case, the brake calipers behind the front wheels do appear similar to McLaren design features involving brightly colored brake calipers, but their visibility is limited by scale and model detailing obscuring precise color recognitions, and they appear more neutral in the model representation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees' leaves maintain a consistent and vibrant green color under the lighting influences within the glass cube, suggesting the designer has used realistic colors matching their depictions in real-world urban environments.",

      "question": "Are white lane markings present on the asphalt road beneath the car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the road beneath the car is clearly visible, with well-defined white lane markings present that emphasizes they are part of the design within the glass-enclosed model street scene, distinguishing the lanes in this compact display.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the car have a raised, sharply angled edge along the side above the wheel arches indicating dihedral door hinges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the representation of the car does resemble McLaren's signature designs which include a sharply angled edge along the side of the vehicle above the wheel arches indicating where the dihedral door hinge feature would logically be situated, even in model form with some compression due to detailing constraints.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there at least two other cars visible in the background â€” one red and one yellow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, limited to the compact scene within a glass cube, the representation includes other vehicles, but the prevalent coloring distinctly focuses on a single other car with evident features colored hosting realistic tones closely approximating a yellow coloration, missing the identification or presence of others colored in red within the confines of this collective model scene.",
