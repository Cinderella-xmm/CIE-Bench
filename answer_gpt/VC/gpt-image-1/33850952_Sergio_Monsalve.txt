    "Question": "Q1: Are there at least eight distinct horizontal levels stacked vertically along the building facade?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the structure depicted doesn't exhibit clear horizontal levels that are characteristic of a building facade. Instead, the design resembles an organic, tentacle-like structure intertwining, and lacks distinct levels or floor separations that would indicate a vertical stacking of levels. There's no traditional building architecture visible, and thus, no evidence of eight horizontal levels.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a transparent railing structure visible on each balcony, positioned directly outside the windows?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not show any balcony structures with transparent railings. The visual elements in the image suggest an organic structure without the hallmarks of a constructed outdoor space, like balconies and railings. Instead, it consists of flowing, natural forms without any signs of traditional architectural elements.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the windows on each floor arranged in a continuous, curved arc along the buildingâ€™s surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there aren't any windows visible. The structure appears to be natural and organic in design, lacking the repetitive geometric shapes or discernible openings that would indicate the presence of windows common in architectural designs.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Can furniture items (such as chairs or tables) be seen inside the rooms through the windows?",
    "explanation": "The absence of windows in Image B means there are no rooms visible, and thus no interior elements like furniture are observable. The image depicts a textured surface intertwined with organic forms, without any transparent sections or indications of inhabited spaces.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the building viewed from a low-angle side perspective, showing its height and curving profile?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not depict a traditional building; rather, it shows what seems to be a close-up of an organic or fantastical structure. This view does not display any clear perspective that showcases height in a manner akin to a building's profile. The image lacks the architectural elements that illustrate a low-angle side perspective.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does each window have a corresponding balcony immediately outside it, aligned horizontally?",
    "explanation": "There are no windows or balconies visible in Image B. The image resembles an organic or abstract structure that lacks any horizontal alignment or architectural features such as windows or balconies. Hence, it doesn't have balconies corresponding to windows.",
    "answer": "No"
