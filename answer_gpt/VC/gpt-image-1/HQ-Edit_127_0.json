      "question": "Is the owl's face clearly depicted with two large, dark, round eyes and a distinct facial disc?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl's face is represented in a diagrammatic style, showcasing its key features. The owl has large, prominent eyes, which are round and dark, and there is an indication of a facial disc, common in owls, which helps them with sound localization. The clear labeling emphasizes these characteristics. By combining visual cues with the world knowledge that owls typically have facial discs, we conclude that the depiction fits this description.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the horizontal bars on the owl’s chest and the white spots on its wings visibly present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the owl with detailed markings; the horizontal bars on its chest are clearly drawn and the white spots on its wings are visible. These features are typical of some owl species and aid in camouflage. The diagram clearly labels 'feathers' suggesting attention to these markings. Thus, based on image analysis and common understanding of owl patterns, these items are visibly present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the owl positioned facing forward with its head slightly turned toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl is depicted in a classic scientific illustration stance, directly facing forward. This positioning often indicates anatomical details, making the species identifiable. Given the frontal illustration, analyzed in the context of standard bird drawings, it suggests the owl's head is slightly facing the observer, common in animal studies for readability.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the tree branch display a deeply ridged and layered bark texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a schematic representation that emphasizes anatomical clarity over photographic realism. The texture of the tree branch is drawn with lines mimicking a simplified version of layered bark. Compared to real-world textures, these lines denote a granular surface, suggesting ridging common to older trees but not as exaggerated as in a detailed photograph like Image A. Hence, this matches a simplified rendition of bark texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the moon located directly behind the owl, centered in the upper portion of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moon is part of a diagram explaining lunar phases, located on the top right. It’s not directly behind the owl nor in the upper central portion like Image A, but serves a different purpose in this educational illustration. Based on spatial distribution and the thematic representation rather than direct visual cues, the moon is included without a central positional emphasis.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there leafy branches visible in the upper corners of the image, forming a partial canopy around the owl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does include some branches and leaves, particularly noted around the borders to add context, typical of botanical illustrations. The positioning suggests a canopy-like partial appearance due to their addition around the owl's perch. Such visual framing is consistent with the educational theme aiming to highlight habitat features relevant for life sciences.",
