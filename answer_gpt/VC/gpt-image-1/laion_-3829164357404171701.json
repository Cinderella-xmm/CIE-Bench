      "question": "Is the large dark gray ribbon bow still present and positioned on the front-left side of the bag?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bag has been creatively modified to resemble a character with eyes made out of flowers and leaf-like structures serving as eyebrows and wings. By analyzing Image B, it's evident that the ribbon bow from Image A has been artistically transformed as part of a new decorative design and is not present as a ribbon bow anymore.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the white artificial flower still visible and centered within the large gray ribbon bow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stylized bag with protruding elements like eyes, wings, and floral features. While some elements resemble flowers, they are integral to the character-like depiction and not centered in a large gray bow as in Image A. Thus, the specific white flower centered within a ribbon bow is missing.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the small gray ribbon bow with a white flower still attached to the right handle by a silver chain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the design changes drastically. The previous decorative elements such as the small gray ribbon bow with a white flower and its attachment to the handle using a silver chain are replaced by stylized and cartoon-like features. Therefore, this ribbon bow is no longer present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the silver chain still visibly connected to the small bow and the right handle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a textured pattern that may give the impression of a decorative chain used in the design, like the creature’s tail, but this is part of the new fantastical design, not connected to a bow as in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the bag’s body still cream-colored and shaped like a woven basket with horizontal ridges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a bag that maintains a woven visual style reminiscent of the original woven basket concept, with a cream-like color but transitioning into a textured pattern mimicking scales. Although it retains a similar form, it lacks the horizontal ridges and specific woven appearance of Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the beige satin interior lining still visible inside the top opening of the bag?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the stylized nature of the depiction, the interior of the bag is not visible and there is no portrayal of a satin lining. The focus is on the artistic rendition of the bag as a creature rather than a functional object with lining.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the background still a white brick wall with a flat white surface beneath the bag?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is entirely changed to a plain, textured surface focusing primarily on the fantastical appearance of the bag as an imaginative creature. There are no white brick walls or white surfaces visible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the text “JourFin LoveRibbon®” still visible in the bottom-right corner of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks any visible branding or text elements from Image A, as it is presented more as a creative, illustrative piece rather than a branded product shot.",
