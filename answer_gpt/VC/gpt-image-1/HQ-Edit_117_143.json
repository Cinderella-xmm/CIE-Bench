      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is depicted in a dynamic pose, with her left arm raised above her head, suggesting a sense of movement and grace.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's silhouette includes heels suggestive of a dancing position, but due to the stylized nature of the illustration, specific color details like red are merged in the more abstract coloring scheme.",
