      "question": "Are the pointed gables with spire-like finials at the roof peaks present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roof of the structure has pointed gables with distinct spire-like finials at the peaks, which are characteristic design elements commonly found in castle architecture. These finials add a decorative touch that enhances the vertical alignment of the structure's roof, contributing to an overall impression of height and grandeur. This observation is based on the visual details and architectural styles typical in miniature castles.",

      "question": "Is there a central balcony with intricately carved wooden railing located below the uppermost gable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show a central balcony with intricately carved wooden railing below the uppermost gable. Instead, the structure visible inside the glass dome resembles a miniature castle devoid of balconies, focusing more on tower and gable details. This choice aligns with the popular depiction of fairy-tale castles, emphasizing spires and towers over balconies, which might not fit within the enclosed space of a glass dome.",

      "question": "Are there arched windows with decorative tracery visible on the front facade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front facade of the miniature castle inside the glass dome includes arched windows with decorative tracery. These elements are identifiable by their arch-shaped frames and intricate detailing commonly seen in Gothic architecture, which is often reproduced in miniature castle designs for aesthetic appeal.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The roof of the miniature structure in Image B is indeed covered in a sapphire-colored material, which mimics blue shingles. This distinct color choice serves to emphasize a fairy-tale or fantasy theme, complementing the overall aesthetics of the miniature castle's design.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the exterior of the structure retain a visible natural wood texture and finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a castle structure encased in glass with a stone-like appearance rather than natural wood texture and finish. The design elements are more focused on replicating stone or concrete structures typical in castles rather than wooden surfaces, noting a divergence from natural wood aesthetics.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central base level features a single wooden door, which is visible in the front facade of the miniature castle within the glass dome. This design element aligns with traditional castle architecture often seen in miniature decorative objects.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The castle structure in Image B presents a facade that is symmetrically arranged around a central vertical axis, observable in the mirrored tower features and the central placement of the door. This symmetry is typical in historical and fantasy architecture, contributing to visual harmony and structural balance.",
