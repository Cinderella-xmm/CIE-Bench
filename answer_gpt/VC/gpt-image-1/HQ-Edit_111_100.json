      "question": "Is the fan-shaped headdress with radiating elements present on the warrior’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the warrior is equipped with a headdress composed of fan-shaped elements that radiate outward, resembling traditional decorative elements one might find in ceremonial or military regalia. These elements are visually consistent with what is typically understood to be a fan-shaped headdress. Similar elements are also present in Image A, creating continuity between appearances.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a circular emblem located at the center of the chest plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly depicts a circular emblem prominently displayed at the center of the warrior’s chest plate, which often signifies a central decorative or symbolic feature on armor or ceremonial attire. The presence of such an emblem is a key characteristic visible in both images.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is a spear held in the warrior’s right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure holds an object in the right hand that resembles a club or hammer more than a spear due to its thick, uniform shape and the lack of a pointed end, contrasting with the traditional long and pointed appearance of a spear. In Image A, the warrior holds a similarly shaped object, confirming it is not a spear in either image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the torso and legs covered in layered, scale-like armor pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The warrior in Image B is adorned with armor, but upon close inspection, it appears blocky, likely inspired by block-based toys or digital designs, rather than the layered, scale-like pieces which would have a more textured and overlapping appearance. Image A depicts a more organic and detailed armor design suggestive of scales.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the statue placed on a white pedestal with two visible plaques at the front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the statue on a pedestal that is clearly white and has a clean, geometric design. However, there are no visible plaques at the front of this pedestal, differentiating it from Image A, where two plaques are clearly visible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are framed landscape artworks visible on both side walls of the gallery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both walls in Image B display framed works that appear to be landscapes or abstract interpretations of nature, matching the arrangement also observed in Image A, indicating the gallery exhibits landscape artwork on both sides.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the statue centered in the gallery space with equal spacing to the side walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue appears well-centered within the gallery space, with symmetrical spacing relative to both side walls, consistent with the arrangement seen in Image A, which suggests intentional curation for visual symmetry.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is a shield-like object held in the warrior’s left hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon evaluation of Image B, the warrior's left hand does not hold a shield but is instead visually depicted as empty or holding a non-shield object, contrasting with typical expectations of a shield's form. This appearance is consistent when observing the same hand in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Does the warrior have a broad nose, deep-set eyes, and a stern mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B specifically avoids detailed facial features due to design style, reminiscent of block-based or minimalist depictions, featuring a blank or non-detailed facial area. This contrasts with Image A, where more detailed facial characteristics such as a broad nose and stern mouth are visible, highlighting differences in artistic interpretation.",
