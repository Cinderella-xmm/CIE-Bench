    "Question": "Q1: Is the golden-brown color present on the plush chicken wings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the plush chicken wings are visually represented with a golden-brown color. The texture and material of the plush suggest typical artistic and realistic representations. The golden-brown color is characteristic of fried chicken, aligning with common representations of cooked chicken wings.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the plush chicken wings shaped like real chicken wings, including distinct drumettes and flats?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the plush chicken wings are clearly shaped to mimic real chicken wings. They include distinct parts such as drumettes, which are the thicker part of a chicken wing, and are recognizable by their rounder shape. This artistic representation uses visual cues to emulate the structure of actual chicken wings.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a small white bowl located at the bottom right corner of the plate?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a circular object is present on the plate beside the plush chicken wings, resembling a white bowl in size and shape. However, it does not appear to accommodate anything within it, making it unlikely to be categorized as a bowl. Instead, it seems more likely to be part of the design, or another plush item, but not a bowl as specified.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the object inside the small white bowl bright orange in color?",
    "explanation": "There is no actual bowl present in Image B. The bright orange object beside the plush chicken wings is not contained within a bowl, rather it is an additional plush item. Since the object's location does not satisfy the criteria of being inside a bowl, this question does not apply.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there approximately ten plush chicken wings on the plate?",
    "explanation": "By inspecting Image B, we observe the presence of eight plush chicken wings positioned around the plate. This number notably does not reach ten. The quantity of plush items is clear in the visual representation, allowing us to be certain in counting fewer than ten.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the small white bowl positioned near the bottom right corner of the plate?",
    "explanation": "As identified previously, there is no small white bowl located on the plate in Image B. A circular plush item is adjacent to the chicken wings, but it does not conform to being a bowl. Furthermore, even this plush item is not specifically placed towards the bottom right corner but more centrally aligned, thus not fulfilling this condition.",
    "answer": "No"
