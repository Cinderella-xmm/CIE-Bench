    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there four clock faces, one on each visible side of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower is illustrated in a cartoon style with only two visible clock faces, each on the visible sides of the tower. The cartoon style generally exaggerates features but does not depict unseen sides, so based on the visual information provided, only two clock faces can be confirmed.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the clock faces contain black Roman numerals arranged in a circular pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock faces are drawn with black Roman numerals arranged in a circular pattern. This is evident from the clear, simplistic and exaggerated nature of the cartoon representation where the crucial details are emphasized for visual clarity.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a steeply pitched pyramidal roof topped with a finial at the very top of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration in Image B shows a steeply pitched pyramidal roof that aligns with traditional architectural features, with a small finial at the very top. This matches common designs for similar architectural structures, visually adapted into a cartoon form.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there four arched openings at the base of the tower, one on each side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the tower with four stylized arched openings, each depicted on the visible sides of the polygonal base. The exaggeration in a cartoon format simplifies perspectives but aims to convey the multiple arches present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the tower located at the center of a circular road with vehicles traveling around it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower is depicted at the center of a circular road, with stylized cars shown traveling around it. This matches the classic roundabout feature, cartoonishly simplified to illustrate the traffic flow around the central structure.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there multiple cars visible on the road surrounding the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B clearly illustrates three cars of different colors occupying a circular arrangement around the tower, suggesting active traffic as usually depicted in animated styles to signify motion and travel.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there trees with bare or sparse foliage visible along the road behind the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, trees are drawn with full foliage, characterized by the cartoonish design which commonly uses vibrant and fully leafed trees for illustrative appeal and simplicity, unlike real-life representations which might show seasonal changes.",
