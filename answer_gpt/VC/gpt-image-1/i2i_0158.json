      "question": "Is the car rendered in its original red color in all views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all views of the car, including the front, side, and rear, consistently show a red color. This conclusion is drawn from observing the uniform coloration throughout all angles presented. It suggests that Image B maintains a coherent color theme without deviations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the front view retain the detailed grille design and Ford emblem in its original position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front view of the car displays a well-defined grille with the Ford emblem prominently positioned at the center, just as is customarily found in Mustang models. This emblem placement and the grille design are clearly visible and distinct, indicating they are retained in their original position.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the same style and configuration of LED daytime running lights visible in both the front and side views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LED daytime running lights are visible on the front view with a distinct style involving three vertical lines. This specific style is not observable in the side view due to the perspective, as only the front view can effectively display the direct look of these lights. Therefore, both views cannot confirm the consistent visibility of this detail due to the angle presented.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do all views show the same specific design and detail of the car’s alloy wheels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car’s alloy wheels appear to retain the same design across different views. The visual cues, such as the multiple-spoke design visible from both side and front views, corroborate the uniformity in the design of the alloy wheels.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car’s body shape and proportions, including the sleek design and aerodynamic curves typical of Mustangs, appear consistently and accurately rendered across all available views, suggesting fidelity to the Mustang’s characteristic design.",
