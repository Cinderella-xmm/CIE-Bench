        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dress in Image B is stylized and simplified, adhering to the typical chibi art style where detailed textures such as crochet patterns are not depicted.

      ],

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design shows that the red boots reach well below the hem of the white dress. The proportions in chibi style generally exaggerate features such as boots, making them noticeable in contrast to the dress above.",
