      "question": "Is the crisscross lattice pattern of pastry strips visible on the pie's surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image features a cartoon pie character with a lattice design on its 'head' that resembles the crisscross pattern typically found on pie lattices. This suggests that the pie is characterized by a lattice pattern. By comparing to Image A, where a lattice pattern is seen, we confirm that both images maintain the lattice feature.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the knife with a metallic blade and wooden handle clearly present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a cartoon illustration, and no actual knives are depicted. Instead, the pie character holds a feather quill, likely emphasizing a thematic element rather than a direct representation of a knife as seen in Image A. Thus, no metallic blade or wooden handle knife is present in the cartoon.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is a fine dusting of white powdered sugar visible on the surface of the pie, particularly over the lattice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, being a cartoon, doesn't realistically represent textures such as powdered sugar dusting. The pie character's surface does not depict any fine powdering akin to sugar dusting, which is evident in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the pie crust uniformly golden brown in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon pie character's crust is illustrated using simple lines and shadings to indicate pie features and doesn't actually depict a specific color like golden brown. Conversely, Image A shows a real pie with a golden brown crust. The lack of realistic color depiction in the cartoon means the answer is no for Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are dark red sections of fruit filling visible through the gaps in the lattice crust?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, as a cartoon drawing, doesn’t depict any realistic fruit filling colors. The lattice pattern on the pie’s surface is filled with simple lines and does not show any dark red fruit fillings. In contrast, Image A clearly has dark red fruit filling visible. Consequently, the answer based on the cartoon image is no.",
