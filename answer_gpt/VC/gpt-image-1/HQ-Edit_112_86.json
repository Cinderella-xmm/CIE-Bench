      "question": "Is the large central rose still present and located at the center of the teapot's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot displays a design with engraved floral patterns, prominently featuring a large rose at the center of its body. This indicates that the rose remains an integral part of the teapot's design. The visual cue of the rose's central position is clear, affirming its continued presence in the edited image. Thus, by recognizing the decorative style commonly used on ornate teapots, we conclude that the large central rose is still present.",

      "question": "Are the surrounding leaves and smaller flowers arranged symmetrically around the central rose in the same configuration as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral engravings including leaves and smaller flowers surrounding the central rose appear to be symmetrically arranged around the rose. To compare, Image A also shows a symmetrical arrangement of leaves and flowers around the central rose, suggesting a design consistency in both images. The world knowledge about design symmetry in artistic objects supports the conclusion that the arrangement remains consistent.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a teapot where the spout is prominently positioned on the left side, extending smoothly and with a curve typical to traditional teapot designs. The consistency in spout placement and shape with artistic and practical teapot design considerations supports the conclusion that the spout's position and shape are retained.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot's handle is clearly visible on the right side, exhibiting an arched shape that complements the spout's curvature. A comparison with Image A reveals similar positioning and shaping of the handle, which aligns with ergonomic and aesthetic principles common to teapot designs. Thus, the handle's attachment and shape are consistent with the original.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The finial in Image B is observable at the top of the teapot's lid, maintaining its decorative and knob-like structure, which is typical for teapots where such design elements are intended to add visual interest and facilitate lid handling. Image A equally showcases similar finial characteristics, confirming that the decorative element remains unchanged.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a teapot lid that covers the top and retains a domed shape with a decorative band near the rim, consistent with common lid designs intended for both aesthetic appeal and practicality. Comparatively, Image A shows similar lid features, suggesting that the practical and decorative aspects of the lid are consistently preserved.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B distinctly exhibits a teapot with a rounded, bulbous body where the transition from the base to the upper section is smooth and uninterrupted, capturing the traditional teapot silhouette often favored for both visual appeal and functional heat distribution. Image A also reflects this shape, which reaffirms its continuity in the teapotâ€™s overall form.",
