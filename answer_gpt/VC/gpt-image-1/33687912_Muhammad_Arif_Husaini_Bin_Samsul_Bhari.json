    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the sun positioned low on the horizon, centered between the two silhouetted landmasses, and appearing as a bright, circular disc?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sun is visually positioned low on the horizon and centered between two darker landmasses, maintaining a bright circular shape, indicating it is near sunset and providing a warm glow. This positioning is usually a typical depiction of a sunset scene, where the sun is at or just above the horizon, emphasizing the colors of sunset.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there two distinct silhouetted landmasses, one on the left and one on the right, framing the horizon and the sun?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two darker landmasses framing the central region of the image where the sun is located. Such silhouettes are common in landscape photography, particularly around bodies of water, creating a visual frame that enhances the scene's depth and focus.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the water surface reflect the orange-red gradient of the sky, creating shimmering patterns that mirror the sunset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water surface displays a visually distinct blend of colors that mirror the warm tones of the sunset sky, with reflections creating a dynamic shimmering effect typical of water under sunset lighting conditions.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sky filled with a gradient of warm orange near the horizon transitioning to deeper red and maroon tones higher up?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B transitions from a warm orange hue near the horizon to deeper reds and maroon tones as you move higher up the image, which is typical of a sunset with atmospheric depth and color variation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a clear, straight horizon line dividing the sky and water, with the sun resting directly on it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visually distinct line dividing the sky and water, with the sun seemingly resting directly on this line. This visual cue typically indicates a straight horizon, providing a structured division between two major components of the landscape scene.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features faint clouds in the upper sky region, with portions of these clouds slightly illuminated by the sunlight. This is characteristic of sunset scenes, where clouds can catch the light and display varying degrees of brightness and color.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the water surface show gentle ripples and small waves, indicating calm movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are signs of gentle ripples and small waves on the water's surface, indicative of a calm water movement. Such patterns are common in images depicting serene and undisturbed aquatic environments, often enhanced by the effects of the lighting and reflections from the sunset.",
