      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Is the banana holder depicted with a curved metal arm supported by a wooden base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the banana holder is illustrated with a curved arm, akin to what a metal arm would look like in real life. However, the arm appears brown, resembling wood rather than metal. Despite the color difference, the depiction maintains the idea of a curved holder, supported by a wooden base as typically seen in banana holders.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the bananas still rest naturally on the curved metal arm?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the bananas in a stylistic cartoon form, resting on a curved holder. The manner in which they hang resembles the typical way bananas would naturally rest on such a holder. However, the holder is colored brown like wood, deviating from the metal appearance. Based on visual cues alone, the bananas do rest on an arm, but the material differs.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's representation of the banana holder maintains a wooden appearance for the base, with illustrated wood grain texture, even though it's in a cartoon style. This visual cue is consistent with what is expected of a wooden texture and appearance.",
