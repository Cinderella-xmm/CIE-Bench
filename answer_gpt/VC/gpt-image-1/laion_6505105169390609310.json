      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the central figure with hands clasped over the chest, suggesting a gesture of humility or offering.

This arrangement is typical in depictions of gift-bearing figures.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure is smaller than the other two figures, evident from his stature compared to the others. He is not standing upright; rather, he is kneeling or positioned lower than the other figures while clasping his hands. This posture is consistent with traditional depictions where the central figure may adopt a lower, more humble stance.",
