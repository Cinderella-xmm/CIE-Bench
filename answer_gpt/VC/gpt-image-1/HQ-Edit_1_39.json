      "question": "Is the rectangular wooden window frame with stone pillars on both sides present and unaltered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the window frame is clearly rectangular and wooden, with stone pillars on both sides. These elements are well-defined and consistent with the visual characteristics expected for a typical window. Based on common architectural designs for such windows, the description matches what is visible in the image.",

      "question": "Are the distant mountains and multiple upright cacti visible in the background beyond the window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a background that features distant mountains and several upright cacti, which are common desert landscape features. Analyzing the visual details, it is evident that these elements form part of the scenery visible through the window frame.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the shadow of the pot cast to the left on the wooden sill, indicating sunlight from the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no pot present; instead, a transformed creature occupies the central position on the windowsill. Shadows from the creature do appear to stretch slightly to the left, which could indicate light coming from the right side of the scene. However, the absence of a pot negates the possibility of confirming a potâ€™s shadow specifically.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a desert scene where the sky is indeed a clear blue with scattered clouds. The use of color and shape in the sky corresponds with a typical clear day with minimal cloud coverage, supporting the claim.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a windowsill that is composed of wooden planks. These planks are shown to have textures indicative of weathering, such as visible grains and cracks, which are typical characteristics of aged wood.",
