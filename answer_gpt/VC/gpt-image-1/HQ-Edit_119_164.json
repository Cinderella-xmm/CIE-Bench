    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the flat-topped acacia trees visible in the background, maintaining their characteristic silhouette and spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background does indeed feature flat-topped acacia trees that can be identified by their distinctly broad, flat canopies, which are slightly silhouetted against the sunset sky, maintaining their characteristic silhouette and spacing similar to those found in typical savannah landscapes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the tall, golden-brown savanna grass present throughout the foreground and midground, matching the original texture and density?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground and midground still depict tall golden-brown savanna grass that seems consistently textured and similar in density to what is typically found in savanna landscapes. Despite the cosmic appearance of the elephant, the grass appears relatively unchanged from its natural depiction.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sky display a continuous gradient from warm orange near the horizon to deep red and purple at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a vivid sky with a gradient that transitions from a warm orange near the horizon to deeper red and purple hues toward the top of the image, creating a colorful sunset ambiance. This gradient aligns with typical sunset visuals.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the horizon line clearly visible and straight, dividing the sky from the savanna landscape at approximately one-third up the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The horizon line in Image B divides the sky from the savanna landscape and is relatively straight, maintaining the typical division between earth and sky. It appears to sit around one-third up from the bottom, conforming to the expected landscape proportions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighting consistent with a low-angle sunset, producing warm highlights on the upper surfaces of the elephant and grass, and casting long shadows behind the subject?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting matches the setting of a low-angle sunset. The warm tones highlight the upper surfaces, especially evident on the savanna grass and the cosmic altered surface of the elephant, creating long shadows consistent with such lighting conditions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the elephant positioned centrally in the frame, facing directly toward the viewer with its body aligned vertically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the elephant facing directly towards the viewer, centrally framed and aligned vertically, with cosmic enhancements giving it a unique appearance without altering its overall central positioning in the composition.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there no visible water bodies, rocky outcrops, or other animals in the background beyond the acacia trees and grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background composition remains focused on acacia trees and grass with no visible bodies of water, rock formations, or other animals presented, maintaining a simple and uncluttered landscape apart from the central elephant.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Do the grass blades in the foreground show individual strands with slight variation in length and direction, contributing to a natural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the grass blades with visible individual strands that present a natural and textured appearance, displaying slight variations in their lengths and directions, consistent with a realistic representation of grass fields.",
