      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the astronaut's face visible through a clear, circular helmet visor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut's helmet has a clear circular visor which allows viewing inside it, although some specific details are obscured. Common knowledge of helmet visors supports that they typically allow for visibility unless otherwise obstructed.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a red, white, and blue American flag patch located on the left shoulder of the suit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the space character appears with a simplified depiction of a spacesuit without clearly defined patches or identification marks. In this cartoon style, such details are often omitted or stylized heavily and are not evident on the shoulder area of the astronaut.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a large, boxy life-support pack attached to the astronaut’s back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts an astronaut with a backpack that appears boxy but is drawn in a manner typical of cartoons, lacking realistic proportions and details typical of actual life-support packs.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible segmented joints at the elbows and knees of the spacesuit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut's elbows and knees are drawn with contour lines that suggest the presence of joints, although they are simplistically represented without clear segmentation as seen in real suits.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there visible dust being kicked up from the lunar surface beneath the astronaut’s right boot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the astronaut standing on a stylized lunar surface with no visible dust or atmospheric effects being represented underneath the boots, typical of exaggerated cartoon art.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is a bright, spherical Earth visible in the sky behind the astronaut?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is filled with stars and stylized elements like shooting stars, but there is no clear depiction of Earth as a spherical body behind the astronaut.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the helmet shaped as a smooth, circular dome with a reflective outer surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The helmet in Image B is drawn as a circular shape typical for astronauts' helmets but executed in a simple, illustrative style without realistic reflective qualities, instead showing outlines and color patterns.",
