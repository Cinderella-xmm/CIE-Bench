      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a depiction of a headpiece adorned with small, clustered flowers atop the woman's head. These flowers are in a lighter, pinkish cream color. This is consistent with the typical design of a floral crown often used in bridal settings to create a soft, romantic appearance.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a veil that starts at the back of the woman's head and extends downward, blending seamlessly with the floral background. The artistic rendering showcases the traditional appearance of a bridal veil in terms of its placement and the flowing nature, which suggests translucency. Bridal veils are usually made from fine fabrics like tulle, which are depicted here. Thus, it can be inferred that there is indeed a translucent veil.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a gown with a long, sheer lace extension draping from the shoulder to the floor. This feature consistently resembles a bridal train where a veil or lace panel extends similarly. The traditional bridal lace train is often used for visual impact, lending grace and elegance. Given these similarities and world knowledge about gowns, it can be concluded that such a panel is present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gown's design reveals a fitted bodice that transitions into a wider, flared skirt, very characteristic of an A-line silhouette. This style is popular in wedding dresses for its ability to flatter various body types by cinching at the waist and softly flaring out. Such visual representation aligns with the description of an A-line gown.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the gown in varying shades of soft cream and blush tones, reflected in the artistic illustration's overall palette. Although traditionally bridal gowns are white, the creative depiction here uses a pastel color scheme consistent with the background to maintain visual harmony. Therefore, despite the subtle hues, the predominant perception is in line with a light tone typical of bridal attire.",
