      "question": "Is the pig’s snout clearly visible with two distinct nostrils and a rounded, pink shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig's snout is visible with two distinct nostrils and appears rounded and pink, as seen in the various illustrations. These are characteristic features of a pig’s snout. The snout is typically drawn prominently in cartoon images to maintain recognizability.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the pig’s ears large, upright, and pink with visible inner ear details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig’s ears are drawn large, upright, and pink, although the inner ear details are simplified due to the cartoon style. This matches the common characteristics of pig ears. Cartoon illustrations tend to stylize animal features, maintaining their essential attributes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question": "Are the sunglasses red in color with round lenses and a thin frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig is wearing sunglasses in a cartoon style. Generally, cartoon illustrations simplify many aspects, and while sunglasses are drawn, they are not explicitly detailed with specific color or style due to the illustration’s style and the absence of such precise detail, unlike Image A where red sunglasses are distinctly visible.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a black turntable with a silver platter, tonearm, and mixer controls beneath the pig’s hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, a cartoon representation of a turntable is shown, but due to the style, details like color and specific components such as platter color or individual mixer controls are simplified and stylistically portrayed compared to the detailed realism in Image A.",

    {

      "question": "Are black over-ear headphones draped around the pig’s neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, headphones are shown in a cartoon style, but specific color details such as being black are not distinguishable due to the simplified representation typical of chibi or cartoon illustrations. In Image A, headphones are clearly depicted as black.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the pig wear a red short-sleeved shirt with a visible collar and sleeves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig is wearing a red-shirt, illustrated with visible short sleeves and collar, suitable for the cartoon style which simplifies clothing detail but retains the identity of the shirt's red color and style. A visible collar is apparent in the images.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig's front hooves are on the elements that resemble a turntable and mixer controls in a simplified cartoon style. While cartoon images may condense details, the positioning of hooves interacting with a musical setup is consistent.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the pig’s skin pink with visible texture, including subtle wrinkles and light reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the pig’s skin is depicted as pink due to the choice of watercolor-like backgrounds and pig illustration. The cartoon style lacks detailed texture representation such as wrinkles and light reflection, focusing instead on essential color and form traits.",
