    "Question": "Q1: Is the \"Wildtrak\" badge visible on the lower side fender of the vehicle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, which depicts a blocky LEGO-like model of a pickup truck, there is no visible detailed badge or emblem on the side fender of the vehicle. Typically, such intricate details would not be replicated in LEGO models due to their simplicity and stylized nature. Thus, based on the absence of such an inscription in the visual and the known characteristics of LEGO models, the conclusion is that the 'Wildtrak' badge is not visible.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the tailgate fully lowered, exposing the truck bed?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO model truck shows the tailgate in an upright position as part of its static design, typical in models where movable parts are not detailed. Additionally, given the style of the replica, details like an open tailgate would usually be clearly visible if designed to be in such a position. Hence, the tailgate is not shown as lowered, exposing the truck bed.",
