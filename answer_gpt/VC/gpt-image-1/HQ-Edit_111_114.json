      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's depiction involves a cartoonish style, showing him wearing a wide-brimmed hat. The brim's size and shape suggest that it could be straw, as this is a common design for cartoon characters representing older men or individuals wearing a typical summer hat, often in straw material. This aligns with the general cartoon depiction norms, assuming it retains the characteristic wide-brimmed straw hat appearance from Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoonish depiction of the man clearly shows a full beard and mustache. These features are prominent and typical of a stylized representation of an older male figure, often portrayed with such facial hair regardless of color in cartoon styles. The lack of color in the cartoon confirms it cannot be judged to be white, but the presence of a beard and mustache are visible.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoonish scooter in Image B maintains a simplified version of a classic scooter design, which typically includes a circular headlight at its front. Despite the stylization, this prominent feature is depicted as part of the scooter's identifiable elements.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, details like a metal luggage rack on the front side of the scooter are not visible. The cartoon style typically simplifies the form and omits additional, less prominent features like luggage racks.",
