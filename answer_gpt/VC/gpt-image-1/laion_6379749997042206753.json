      "question": "Is the brand name \"Karls\" clearly visible on the label of the jar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on a cartoonish representation of a popcorn journey rather than a real product packaging. There are no actual jars with labels featuring brand names. The visuals depict different stages and elements associated with popcorn in a stylized and illustrated manner, without realistic brand representations. Therefore, there is no brand name visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the text \"Pumpkin Spice Popcorn\" present on the label of the jar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, texts are presented as part of a narrative or instructional guide titled 'The Magical Pumpkin Spice Popcorn Journey.' There are descriptions related to different stages of popcorn but not in the form of labels on jars. The text 'Pumpkin Spice Popcorn' is part of the title, but not specifically presented as jar labels as would be typically found on product packaging.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the popcorn contained in a clear glass jar with a silver metal lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the concept of popcorn in various stages using cartoon imagery, rather than showcasing real jars or containers. One cartoon image represents popcorn emerging from a jar, but the cartoon design does not include clear glass or a silver metal lid option typically recognized in retail contexts; it's more symbolic.",
      "weight": 3,

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a white ceramic bowl with a blue rim containing popped popcorn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows cartoon characters and scenes related to popcorn but does not explicitly have realistic representations such as bowls and rims seen with physical objects like ceramics. The illustration style focuses on imaginative storytelling.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are unpopped corn kernels visible in a separate clear jar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration does include a drawing of a smiling kernel in the '1. Kernel' stage but does not show kernels in separate jars as in real-life depictions like in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question": "Are the dominant colors of the labels and popcorn orange and brown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dominant color theme is orange and white, which fits the thematic style of 'Pumpkin Spice' imagery. Brown is used for text and some icons but not as the dominant theme as observed in real-world labels that might use brown extensively for fall themes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question": "Is the scene set on a wooden surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is set as an illustrated cartoon environment that doesn't suggest a wooden surface. The illustrations and text are laid out on a generic digital canvas used for storytelling, not on any realistic surface like wood.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are unpopped or popped popcorn kernels scattered on the surface around the jars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses characters and icons to portray popcorn-related stages, but does not show any kernels scattered around jars. Kernels are integrated into specific illustrated steps in the narrative but not scattered.",
