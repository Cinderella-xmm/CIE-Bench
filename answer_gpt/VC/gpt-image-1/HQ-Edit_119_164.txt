    "Question": "Q2: Is the tall, golden-brown savanna grass present throughout the foreground and midground, matching the original texture and density?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground and midground still depict tall golden-brown savanna grass that seems consistently textured and similar in density to what is typically found in savanna landscapes. Despite the cosmic appearance of the elephant, the grass appears relatively unchanged from its natural depiction.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the lighting consistent with a low-angle sunset, producing warm highlights on the upper surfaces of the elephant and grass, and casting long shadows behind the subject?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting matches the setting of a low-angle sunset. The warm tones highlight the upper surfaces, especially evident on the savanna grass and the cosmic altered surface of the elephant, creating long shadows consistent with such lighting conditions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the elephant positioned centrally in the frame, facing directly toward the viewer with its body aligned vertically?",
    "explanation": "Image B features the elephant facing directly towards the viewer, centrally framed and aligned vertically, with cosmic enhancements giving it a unique appearance without altering its overall central positioning in the composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q8: Do the grass blades in the foreground show individual strands with slight variation in length and direction, contributing to a natural texture?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the grass blades with visible individual strands that present a natural and textured appearance, displaying slight variations in their lengths and directions, consistent with a realistic representation of grass fields.",
    "answer": "Yes"
