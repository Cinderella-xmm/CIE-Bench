    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a large, circular, reddish celestial body located in the upper left portion of the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a large, circular, reddish object at the top left which resembles a celestial body like the sun. It is stylized with what appears to be an embroidered border, perfectly round and positioned prominently in the sky, fitting the description given.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a prominent mountain range with snow-covered peaks spanning the background behind the lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain range features geometric patterns but does not explicitly show snow-covered peaks. Instead, it has a stylized, embroidered appearance. This indicates that while there is a mountain range, it doesn't show snow in a realistic manner and doesn't span the background in a way suitable for that description.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a large, reflective body of water occupying the central foreground of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a flowing river that curves through the landscape, more so than a flat, reflective body like a lake. It is stylized as a series of stitched lines without reflective qualities, differing from the typical appearance of a reflective lake.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there clusters of red-colored trees lining both banks of the lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed clusters of red trees on both sides, surrounding the river rather than a lake, stylized with detailed embroidery that gives them distinct outline and color.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the surface of the lake reflect the red moon and the snow-capped mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water is stylized as a series of wavy embroidered lines without any reflections visible. It doesn't feature the reflective qualities as seen in tranquil lakes, hence, it does not show reflections of the celestial body or mountains.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible rocks and patches of snow along the lakeâ€™s edge in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible rock-like shapes near the water's edge, styled with embroidery. However, there are no visible patches that resemble snow as in a realistic setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the moon positioned above the mountain range and the lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the embroidered celestial body is positioned directly above the stylized mountain range and above the river, reflecting a placement that aligns with the description of a moon being above these elements.",
