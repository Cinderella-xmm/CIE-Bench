        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B of the edited version, a zebra appears against a plain green background with no visible racer or start banner. Therefore, the 'START' banner as seen in Image A is not present in Image B. Based on this observation, along with the common color associations and lack of any red text, the large red text 'START' is not visible in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a zebra is present instead of a skier. The zebra does not have ski poles or any skiing gear. Using common knowledge, zebras do not use ski equipment or wear skiing attire, which was visible in Image A. Therefore, based on the visual cues and typical functions of zebras, the skier is not holding ski poles or dressed in skiing gear in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the skier's bib with the number \"66\" still visible and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a zebra without any form of bib or numerical markings. While the skier wore a bib with the number '66' in Image A, the edited version does not feature any neckwear or indication of such numeric identifiers. From the lack of skier imagery and any attire suggesting a bib, the skier's bib is not visible in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the snowy ground and visible ski tracks still present under the skier?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra stands on a dirt-like, sandy surface, typical of its natural habitat. The snowy ground and ski tracks visible under the skier in Image A are absent in the edited image. Leveraging knowledge of environments associated with zebras, the terrain in Image B does not support snow and ski tracks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the skier maintain a forward-leaning posture indicating readiness to start the race?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The zebra in Image B is standing upright and stationary, unlike the forward-leaning posture a skier holds to indicate readiness for a ski race. Observing the zebra's alignment and grounded stance, its posture contrasts with the active posture of readiness seen in Image A's skier. The common stance for a zebra further reinforces the lack of race readiness posture.",
