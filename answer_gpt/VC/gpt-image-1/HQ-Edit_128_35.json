      "question": "Is the curved carriage of the typewriter present and accurately shaped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the typewriter features a top section, or carriage, where the paper spool and levers are located. A common feature of traditional typewriters is the curved shape of the carriage to accommodate the movement of the roller. The image shows this sectional curve correctly, reflecting typical typewriter designs. Thus, visually confirming the presence and accurate shaping.",

      "question": "Are the round silver key caps arranged in a QWERTY layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keyboard of the typewriter displays round keys identical to those found on many traditional typewriters. A QWERTY layout is distinguishable by the positioning of the top left row of letters starting with Q, W, E, R, T, and Y. While the detail in the image may not be clear enough to definitively state the layout, the arrangement and number of keys suggest a QWERTY configuration typical for typewriters.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the brand name \"Underwood\" visible on the front panel of the typewriter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B provides a clear, frontal view of the typewriter; however, there is no visible text or branding shown on the front panel. Typically, typewriter brands like 'Underwood' are prominently displayed on the front or top panel. The absence of visible text confirms that the brand name is not present.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the radial fan-like pattern beneath the carriage present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In typical typewriters, a radial fan-like pattern can often be found beneath the paper carriage, serving as a decorative or protective feature. Image B shows such a pattern beneath the carriage of the typewriter. The spokes fanning outward are quite visible, indicating its presence.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the side knobs and left lever present on the typewriter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the complete side view of the typewriter, including the knobs used for adjusting paper alignment and a lever on the left for carriage return. These components are traditionally part of a manual typewriter's mechanisms for operation. Both the side knobs and left lever are evident in the image.",

      "question": "Is the typewriter body predominantly glossy black?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the typewriter's body appears to be finished with a glossy surface, indicated by the light reflections on its surface. The consistent reflection pattern over the body suggests it is predominantly of a glossy black color, typical for many vintage typewriters.",

      "question": "Is the platen roller visible above the keyboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The platen roller, a prominent cylindrical component on a typewriter, is positioned behind the keys to hold the paper in place. Image B shows a section above the keyboard where such a component would be expected. While the detailed structure aligning precisely with a platen roller is not directly visible, enough of the carriage area is shown, suggesting its presence at the expected location directly above the keys.",
