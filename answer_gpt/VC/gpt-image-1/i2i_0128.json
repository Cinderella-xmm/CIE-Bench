      "question": "Are the hands still visibly interacting with and pressing the keys on the keyboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands are positioned over the keyboard in a manner that suggests interaction with the keys. The fingers are curved and placed in such a way that they appear to be pressing the keys. This observation, combined with common knowledge of typing postures, supports the conclusion that the hands are indeed interacting with the keyboard.",

      "question": "Does the keyboard retain its original physical layout and key structure despite the added neon effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the keyboard layout and key structure appear unchanged despite the neon lighting. The keys and their arrangement remain consistent with a standard laptop keyboard. By comparing the arrangement and structure in Image A and confirming they match, we can conclude that the keyboard's physical design has not been altered by the neon effects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the laptop's overall body shape and placement relative to the hands consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the placement and overall shape of the laptop relative to the hands closely match what is seen in Image A. The positioning of both the keyboard and hands suggests interaction as seen in traditional laptop use, with no noticeable change in the dimensions or layout of the laptop body.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the hands retain their general posture and positioning relative to the keyboard as seen in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hands in Image B maintain a typing posture similar to Image A, indicating consistency in their positioning relative to the keyboard. This is supported by the curved position of the fingers and the alignment with the key layout, which are typical indicators of an active typing position.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image retain realistic textures for the keyboard and the surface under the hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B features neon effects that alter the overall color and lighting, the textures of both the keyboard and the laptop surface under the hands remain realistic. The reflections and finish of the surfaces seem authentic, preserving a sense of real-world material textures despite the artificial color scheme.",
