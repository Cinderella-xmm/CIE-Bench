        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe that the mirror hangs above a cabinet, which itself holds the sink. The alignment of these elements suggests a standard configuration where the sink is directly below the mirror. This is a common arrangement in bathroom designs for practical purposes like personal grooming. This visual structure supports the conclusion that the sink is positioned directly below the mirror.",

      "question": "Does the image include a mirror with a black frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly features a mirror outlined by distinct neon lighting, which creates an apparent frame. The vibrancy of the colors masks the original frame color. However, assessing Image A reveals a black frame, suggesting that Image B has maintained the form but altered the color perception with neon effects. Therefore, considering the original frame was black and thereâ€™s no clear evidence of color frame modification, it's reasonable to deduce the frame is black.",

      "question": "Are the fixtures and cabinet predominantly black, while the sink remains white?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses strong neon colors and lighting effects, which include shades of blue, pink, and orange, and might obscure true color evaluation. Despite this, the cabinets display darker colors, seen as blue in the neon, possibly representing black in Image A. The sink appears in neon hues suggesting it remains its original white color, following the perception alteration by neon lights. Comparison with Image A and reasoning from neon colors lead to confirming the original color scheme.",

      "question": "Do the mirror, sink, and cabinets maintain their rectangular shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, despite the intense influence of neon lighting impacting color perception, the structural shapes remain clear. The mirror and the set of cabinet boxes retain their rectangular outlines, consistent with traditional designs depicted in Image A. Further visuals and normal architecture aid in affirming that these elements maintain their rectangular shapes throughout the visual editing.",

      "question": "Is the black faucet positioned beside the black soap dispenser on the sink?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the faucet and dispenser are colored with neon effects, hindering original color visibility. However, their placement remains unchanged, with the faucet situated next to the soap dispenser. Understanding the layout from Image A, where both items are black, the analysis of spatial arrangement aided by Image A confirms these elements are correctly positioned together.",
