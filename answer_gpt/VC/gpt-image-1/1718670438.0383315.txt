    "Question": "Q1: Does the robot retain its dome-shaped head with three evenly spaced circular porthole eyes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robot does indeed maintain a dome-shaped head with three evenly spaced circular porthole eyes. This can be identified by observing the design features typical of steampunk aesthetics, such as rounded shapes and symmetrical layouts, which are consistent with the characteristics described.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the transparent chest panel still present, clearly displaying the internal gear system?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases a robot with a transparent chest panel, through which the internal gear system is visible. This transparency allows one to see mechanical elements, which aligns with the steampunk design themes of exposed machinery. This visual clue confirms the presence of the described feature.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do both arms retain their segmented, piston-style joint construction?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's arms are segmented, showing piston-style joint construction. This characteristic implies a structure designed for flexibility and mechanical articulation, common in retro-futuristic robot depictions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are both feet equipped with exactly five claw-like toes each?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays feet with fewer than five claw-like toes each, diverging from the original design specification of five toes per foot, which is often used to enhance stability in robotic designs.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there five distinct spires and antennae on top of the robot’s head, including one central and four lateral ones?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are fewer than five distinct spires and antennae visible on the robot's head, hence diverging from the claimed design. Typically, such elements might be added for aesthetic or symbolic purposes, but the image does not reflect this described modification.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are multiple interlocking gears of different sizes visible through the transparent chest panel?",
    "explanation": "Through the transparent chest panel in Image B, multiple interlocking gears of different sizes are observed, indicative of complex mechanical inner workings, a hallmark of steampunk design, providing insight into the robot's construction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the robot maintain its original oxidized bronze and copper color scheme with visible wear and aging effects?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robot retains an oxidized bronze and copper color scheme with subtle textures suggesting wear and aging effects, consistent with aesthetic preferences for conveying antiquity and history in steampunk designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Are the rivets and mechanical fasteners visible along the joints and edges of the robot’s body?",
    "explanation": "The observation of Image B reveals rivets and mechanical fasteners visibly integrated into the robot's joints and edges, reinforcing the design theme of mechanical assembly commonly found in steampunk-inspired machinery.",
    "answer": "Yes"
