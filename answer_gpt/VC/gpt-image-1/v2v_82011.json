        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the standing figure appears to have both arms extended outward, which is consistent with a ballet pose. While the illustration style has changed, the positioning of the arms suggests an ongoing ballet theme, consistent with the pose seen in Image A where the doll's arms were posed outward. Thus, the pose is retained.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the standing figure is depicted with a skirt that resembles a tutu in its shape and positioning relative to the body. The color is a light shade against the rest of the outfit, indicating it is light-colored. In Image A, the doll was wearing a similar light-colored tutu as part of its ballet attire. Therefore, the tutu is still present in Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seated figure is illustrated wearing a top that is colored in a shade similar to pink, as seen in the representation style of the artwork. This matches Image A, where the seated doll was dressed in a distinct pink top. Thus, the seated doll retains the pink-colored top in Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows both figures with hair illustrated in a light color that typically represents blonde in cartoon-style illustrations. The standing figure's hair retains the braided aspect, akin to the standing doll in Image A where both dolls had blonde hairstyles, and the standing doll had a braid. Therefore, the blonde hair and braid are preserved in the edited image.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artwork portrays a ground surface pattern beneath both figures, suggesting a shared space where one is standing and the other seated. Although the depiction style has changed, the layout is reflective of Image A, where both dolls were on the same display table, positioned similarly. This layout is maintained in Image B.",
