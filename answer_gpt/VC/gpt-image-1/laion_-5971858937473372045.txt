    "explanation": "In the edited image, each woman is depicted holding a bouquet with both hands, centrally positioned in front of their bodies.

    "Question": "Q4: Are all three women facing directly toward the camera?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, all three women are facing forward with their torsos and the position of their bouquets directed towards what would be the audience, suggesting they are facing directly toward the 'camera' or viewer in this painted representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are all three women standing upright with full body visible?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the women from slightly above the knee upwards; it does not depict their full bodies, as their legs and feet are not visible. Therefore, they are not shown in full-body in standing position.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the central woman have a wide, open-mouthed smile showing teeth?",
    "explanation": "In the context of the image being a historical painting, it is unlikely to depict modern expressions such as a wide, open-mouthed smile, which would show teeth. Traditional portraits usually feature more reserved expressions. Although the faces are blurred, the style does not suggest a smiling expression as described.",
    "answer": "No"
