    "Question": "Q1: Is the brand name 'WARING' displayed in bold white capital letters on a black rectangular plaque with a textured border?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the brand name 'WARING' is visible on the box exterior rather than a plaque. It is indeed presented in bold white capital letters, but it is printed directly on the box, not on a textured plaque. The display is straightforward without the use of a plaque or border. Image A shows the actual product where the brand name is displayed as described on a plaque. Therefore, based on the described attributes directly present on the food processor, the answer for image B is No.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the control buttons labeled 'OFF' (red), 'ON' (green), and 'PULSE' (blue) arranged horizontally on the base?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the food processor is depicted on the packaging where the buttons are visible on the illustration of the product, arranged horizontally. Image A from the actual product view shows the buttons placed horizontally on the base with the same labels and colors. Hence, they are horizontal as observed in the original product display. With that, the correct choice for image B is Yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the processing bowl have a black handle attached to its left side?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the packaging depicts the food processor with a dark-colored handle clearly visible on the left side of the processing bowl. This handle is illustrated with visual consistency comparable to Image A, which shows the product itself with a black handle attached on the left side. Therefore, the correct choice reflecting the depiction in Image B is Yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a transparent lid covering the bowl with a vertical feed tube and a pusher mechanism visible at the top?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows an illustration of the processor on the packaging where a transparent lid is visible. It includes a vertical feed tube but lacks detailed visibility of the pusher mechanism at the specific angle depicted. In Image A, the food processor visually incorporates both the transparent lid and feed tube as described. Despite the visibility issue of the pusher mechanism, the overall structural components align, hence the answer is Yes for the intended lid and tube depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the feed tube a tall, vertical cylinder extending upward from the center of the lid?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the feed tube illustrated alongside the processor on the packaging appears as a vertical cylinder positioned to the side rather than directly from the center. Image A displays the component emerging centrally from the lid. Therefore, based on image B's representation, the answer is No.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the base of the food processor silver metallic with black feet at the bottom corners?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging exhibits a depiction where the base appears silver in color, maintaining a metallic aesthetic with black foot pads at each corner, akin to Image A's direct view of the processor itself. The design suggests a silver metallic base structure complemented by black feet positioned at the bottom corners. Therefore, the correct option according to Image B is Yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the food processor maintain the same proportional relationship between the base, bowl, and feed tube as shown in the original image?",
    "explanation": "Image B features an illustration that appears to keep the same proportions between the processor components, similar to Image A. It conveys proportionality concerning the depicted base, bowl, and feed tube. The proportions seem consistent between the packaging depiction and the actual product. Therefore, the answer reflecting proportional similarity in Image B is Yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
