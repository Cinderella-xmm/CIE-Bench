      "question": "Are there exactly three triangular sails attached to the dhow, arranged in a staggered vertical line?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dhow has three triangular sails that are attached to the mast. The sails are displayed in a vertical line and are staggered at different heights, which is a common arrangement for such vessels, ensuring they catch wind effectively. The illustration style makes these sails distinct and visible. Thus, there are three sails arranged in this manner.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dhow have a wooden hull with visible arched windows and decorative lattice railings along the upper deck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dhow depicted in Image B features a hull that traditionally would be wooden, as common dhow constructions involve wood. This vessel illustration shows arched windows and confirms decorative elements resembling lattice designs along the upper deck, which adds to the authenticity and aesthetic of the dhow. These are visually clear upon inspecting the image's depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the dhow oriented diagonally across the frame, with its bow pointing toward the upper right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dhow is oriented primarily horizontally across the frame rather than diagonally, as indicated by the direction of the sails and hull. The bow does not point toward the upper right but rather horizontally to the right edge of the image. This suggests a horizontal orientation rather than a diagonal one.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there multiple small sailboats visible on the horizon in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the background of Image B, the setting does include additional smaller sailboats which can be seen near the horizon. This aspect of Image B is indicative of maritime scenes where multiple vessels are often depicted to show the activity in a sailing area.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sun located low on the left side of the image, casting a bright golden reflection across the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of a sunset or sunrise with a bright golden reflection across the water surface. This scene is depicted in a stylized nighttime setting, possibly under moonlight with a vivid blue palette, not showing sun reflections. Thus, these attributes are not present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a visible wake and reflection of the dhow beneath its hull on the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a stylized and illustrated representation of water and marine life but lacks realistic elements such as the wake and reflection typically seen in photographs or more realistic paintings. Consequently, there is no visible wake emanating from the dhow's movement nor a reflection beneath its hull.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the dhow have a long, pointed bow extending forward from the hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dhow in Image B is shown with a long, pointed bow, which is a characteristic feature of traditional dhow designs. The illustration emphasizes this aspect, capturing the shape and allowing for a clear view of this pointed bow extending forward, consistent with the aesthetics of dhow vessels.",
