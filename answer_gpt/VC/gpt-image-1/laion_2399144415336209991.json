      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the groom character is illustrated with short brown hair, fitting the portrayal of a groom with conventional hair styling.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bride character adorned with jewelry including a stylized pearl necklace and earrings. While her wrist is adorned with a bracelet, the stylized design may prevent a clear identification of 'multi-strand.'",
