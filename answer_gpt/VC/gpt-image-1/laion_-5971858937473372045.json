    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there exactly three women in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), there are three figures positioned in what appears to be a formal portrait setting. This suggests that there are indeed three women present in the image, as they are dressed in attire reminiscent of a historical painting, typically used to depict women.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the central woman positioned directly between the other two women?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a central figure who is prominently placed, flanked symmetrically by the other two women. This composition is intentional and clearly indicates that the central woman is directly between the two others.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do all three women hold bouquets in front of their bodies with both hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, each woman is depicted holding a bouquet with both hands, centrally positioned in front of their bodies. This is consistent with historical portraiture, where subjects often hold objects to indicate their status or role, such as bridesmaids carrying bouquets in a wedding context.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all three women facing directly toward the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all three women are facing forward with their torsos and the position of their bouquets directed towards what would be the audience, suggesting they are facing directly toward the 'camera' or viewer in this painted representation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all three women standing upright with full body visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the women from slightly above the knee upwards; it does not depict their full bodies, as their legs and feet are not visible. Therefore, they are not shown in full-body in standing position.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the central woman have a wide, open-mouthed smile showing teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the context of the image being a historical painting, it is unlikely to depict modern expressions such as a wide, open-mouthed smile, which would show teeth. Traditional portraits usually feature more reserved expressions. Although the faces are blurred, the style does not suggest a smiling expression as described.",
      "weight": 2,
