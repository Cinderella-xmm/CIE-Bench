    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the distinctive golden lattice framework of the Address Downtown tower visible and structurally intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible building with a golden lattice framework as is characteristic of the Address Downtown tower. Instead, Image B presents a sci-fi themed scene with a large, robot-like figure that dominates the frame, suggesting a departure from the original image's skyline view.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the cylindrical shape and curved top of the Emaar Tower preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature any cylindrical buildings or buildings with a curved top that are typically associated with Emaar Tower. The image has a futuristic aesthetic with abstract and non-realistic elements, which do not match the description of the Emaar Tower.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the Address Downtown tower located to the left of the Emaar Tower in the skyline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Without recognizable landmarks or standard skyscrapers, Image B does not present the Address Downtown tower or Emaar Tower. The edited image mainly portrays a large, glowing, robot-like figure and abstract structures, not a real-world urban skyline.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the beige, low-rise buildings with arched windows visible in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, with its futuristic and almost surreal composition, does not include any visible low-rise buildings with arched windows in the foreground. The scene depicted is entirely different and does not mimic the architecture or layout of the original cityscape.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the large building with a green roof and illuminated frontage visible in the midground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image replaces the actual cityscape with a creative and futuristic environment. There is no distinctive large building with a green roof and lit frontage as might be described in a real-world setting. The context and content of the composition have changed dramatically.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the sky uniformly dark blue with no visible clouds or stars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a sky that is more integrated into the overall teal-green theme of the edited image, with glowing circular motifs present overall, which represent artificial objects rather than natural elements like clouds or stars.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the tallest, tapering skyscraper in the background visible with a glowing crown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, there are no realistic skyscrapers as traditional architectural elements with a glowing crown. Instead, the structures are artistic and fictional, aligning with the sci-fi theme, so traditional descriptions are not applicable.",
