      "question": "Is the stapler's primary color blue in both the front and rear views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the stapler is clearly blue in the front view, as this color is prominent on its body and cover. In the rear view, the entire stapler shown is also blue, confirming that the primary color is consistently blue across both views. The assessment involves recognizing the distinct blue hue on the stapler's surface without deviation between views.",

      "question": "Does the metallic hinge appear on the stapler in both the front and rear views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the front view of the stapler shows a metallic hinge where the stapler opens and stamps staples into paper. However, the rear view of the stapler does not display any metallic parts as it shows the back of the stapler that typically doesn't include visible hinges. Therefore, the conclusion is derived by understanding the typical structure of a stapler and noting the absence of metallic components in the rear view.",

      "question": "Is the stapling slot visible in the front view of the stapler?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The front view of the stapler in Image B clearly displays the slot where staples are ejected when pressed against paper. This visibility indicates that the front view directly shows the functional aspect of the stapler, supporting the conclusion that the stapling slot is visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a light blue strip visible on the top surface of the stapler in both views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the analysis of Image B, neither the front nor the rear view of the stapler shows a light blue strip on the top surface. The stapler maintains a consistent shade of blue across its top, suggesting there is no additional strip or variation in color. Thus, the observation leads to the conclusion that no light blue strip is present.",

      "question": "Is the background uniformly green in both the front and rear views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, both views of the stapler have a consistent green backdrop, enhancing the visual uniformity across the images. The green and cylindrical pedestal also provides a seamless presentation of a uniform green background, which aligns with the reasoning through visual inspection of matching colors.",
