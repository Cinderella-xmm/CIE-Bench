      "question": "Does the edited image retain the grainy, porous texture of the whole wheat bread slices?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Heroic Bread Warrior' is depicted as an animated anthropomorphic sandwich character. The visual style is cartoonish, which typically does not emphasize realistic textures but rather uses simple color filling and lines. Therefore, the specific grainy, porous texture associated with actual whole wheat bread is not a feature highlighted in this style. In a cartoon context, the bread is illustrated more as a flat area of brown color without detailed texture. Given this style, a viewer would not perceive the texture of whole wheat bread as being accurately represented.",

      "question": "Is the green color and leafy shape of the lettuce leaves preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character with green leafage, which resembles lettuce in color and form, consistent with common depictions of lettuce in both reality and simplified artwork styles. Lettuce is often depicted by a wavy, uneven outline to imply a leafy texture, which is what is noticeable here. The color is a prominent green, which is typically associated with fresh lettuce.",

      "question": "Is the red tomato slice visible and intact in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a clear red circular shape that represents a tomato slice as part of the sandwich character. The red color and round shape are indicative of a tomato, following the common representation of tomato slices in cartoons and artwork where the focus isn't on realistic detailing but rather color and shape association.",

      "question": "Is the text “AMERICA’S” displayed in brown serif font above the ribbon in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature any text similar to the style described. Instead, it expresses the theme of a 'Heroic Bread Warrior' through illustrations and comic-style texts. The artistic focus and theme in Image B are different, and there is an absence of structured font elements like in Image A.",

    {

      "question": "Is the maroon ribbon banner present across the center of the sandwich in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) showcases a cartoon sandwich character with no such design element as a maroon ribbon. Instead, it uses comic-style lettering and illustration to portray the narrative of a 'heroic bread warrior,' emphasizing a storyline rather than presentation elements such as banners or ribbons.",

      "question": "Is the trademark symbol (™) present next to the word “SANDWICH” in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on the fun, cartoony representation of a sandwich warrior. There are no legal designations or symbols such as a trademark (™) sign present in the comic-style narrative. This choice of presentation aligns with entertainment rather than branding concerns that a trademark might indicate.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is characterized by vivid, animated art that represents a sandwich-like character with no distinct serif font text and no presence of the word 'SANDWICH™'. The text across Image B is designed to narrate a story rather than focus on branding or descriptive identifiers like in Image A.",
