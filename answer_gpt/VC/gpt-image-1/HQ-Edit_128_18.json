      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffe is depicted in a stylized, cartoonish form as part of a jungle-themed toy package. The giraffe has two small, rounded ossicones on top of its head, which are consistent with typical depictions of giraffes both in nature and in toy designs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a toy giraffe in a jungle-themed illustration, where the giraffe is drawn with dark eyes that give it an expressive look and a mouth that is slightly turned upwards, giving an appearance of a gentle smile. This artistic choice is common in toy designs to make the character appear friendly and approachable.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict an interior room setting. The context is a jungle-themed package illustration where the giraffe is centrally placed in the packaging design, with other jungle animals around it. The concept of it standing in the center of a 'room' does not apply here as it is not in an indoor setting.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffe is illustrated as part of a cartoonish toy package design. The texture of the drawing is smooth and stylized, typical of illustrations rather than realistic textures. Therefore, there is no indication of a plush, fuzzy texture present in this illustration.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the illustrated Image B, the giraffe's ears are drawn with a rounded shape and are symmetrically placed on either side of its head. This symmetry and rounded shape are typical of anatomical and cartoon depictions of giraffe ears.",
