    "Question": "Q1: Is the amber-colored liquid visible in the short glass?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the short glass displays an orange glow that simulates the appearance of a filled liquid in a neon style. This visual cue suggests an amber-colored liquid is present. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that orange and amber share similar hues, and the neon style of Image B does not change this fundamental coloration.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the tall glass completely filled with ice?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tall glass has a design using blue neon lights that shows cubic shapes suggesting the presence of ice, but it does not appear completely filled, as there are visual gaps.
