      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style rider is depicted wearing a shirt that resembles the beige shirt from Image A.

        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is illustrated with a brown coat, which aligns with the standard color representation of horses in this artistic style. Cartoon renditions often preserve key features such as coloration to ensure the character remains recognizable while stylizing other features.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "The horse in Image B is shown with a black bridle, consistent with Image A. This detail is critical for representing the tack equipment an equestrian horse would wear, and cartoons typically maintain such details to enhance character recognition despite stylization.",

        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rider is depicted holding the reins, similar to Image A. The position and grasp of the reins are illustrated to convey control over the horse, which is a typical posture in equestrian settings, even in stylized formats.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is stylized and lacks details. Instead of an elaborate setting, it uses neutral colors to suggest a simplistic backdrop, focusing more on the characters. The essence of an earthy outdoor setting is lost in the transition to a simplified cartoon format, which does not feature similar tones to Image A.",
