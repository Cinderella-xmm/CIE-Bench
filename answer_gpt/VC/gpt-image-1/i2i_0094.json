    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the Nikon branding visible and legible in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration clearly displays 'Nikon' on the top part of the camera body, and the text is legible. This is evident from the clear distinct letters and their usual positioning on the camera, combined with knowledge of typical branding placements on cameras.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the lens positioned centrally on the camera body in the steampunk illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lens is depicted as centrally located on the camera body, consistent with typical camera designs and visually confirmed by its placement directly in the middle of the camera body structure, matching common camera configurations in photography.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the tripod still visibly connected to the camera through a central mount?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration shows the camera mounted on the tripod through a central mounting point, which is consistent with how tripods typically support cameras. This central connection appears visually correct and aligned with standard camera setups.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the relative proportions of the camera body, lens, and tripod maintained in the steampunk rendition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions among the camera body, lens, and tripod appear exaggerated for stylistic effect, especially given the steampunk theme, which often incorporates disproportionate elements for aesthetic purposes. This differs from Image A, where proportions are realistic.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the illustration retain a clear depiction of metallic textures on the camera and tripod?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration, while detailed, uses a wood-like texture rather than metal, fitting the steampunk aesthetic that often incorporates wood and brass elements. Hence, the depiction of metallic textures is not clear or identifiable as metallic.",
