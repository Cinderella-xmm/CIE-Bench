    "Question": "Q1: Is the light blue botanical pattern (leaf and vine motifs) present on the bedding in the LEGO version?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bed appears to be constructed from LEGO pieces, which are commonly known to recreate textures using block designs. The bedding in Image B mimics a fabric-like texture with light blue patterns resembling leaves or vines visible upon its surface. These patterns closely correspond to botanical motifs, which confirms the presence of such botanical patterns in the LEGO version.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the blanket folded and positioned on the right half of the bed?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the blanket, indicated by the patterned surface, is indeed positioned on the right half of the bed, with visible creases implying it is folded. This placement on the right half aligns with the description.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the dark brown rectangular object visible in the upper right corner of the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible dark brown rectangular object present in the upper right corner; the background is entirely gray. Thus, this object is absent in this version.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the bed positioned horizontally and centered within the frame?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the bed positioned horizontally, spanning from left to right across the image. However, it is more aligned towards the lower side than the center, with more space appearing on top. This suggests the bed is not perfectly centered vertically but is centered horizontally.",
    "answer": "Yes"
