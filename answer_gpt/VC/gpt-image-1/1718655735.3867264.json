    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the angular, filigree-patterned metallic mask covering the upper face, including the prominent crest and eye-covering section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic mask featuring angular designs and intricate filigree patterns is apparent. It covers the upper part of the face and includes a prominent crest and eye-covering sections. This is consistent with the visual cues found in Image B, which match those in Image A where the mask is clearly depicted. The distinct design elements like the crest and eye-covering sections are evidently retained in the edited image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the butterfly wings retained with their original veined structure and mottled brown-orange coloration, even if rendered with a metallic or shimmering surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows wings that mirror the structure and coloration seen in Image A, with visible veins and mottled brown-orange hues. The surface of the wings in Image B seems to have a metallic or shimmering appearance, but the key design characteristics, such as color and vein pattern, are retained. This analysis indicates the essence and original attributes of the wings are kept intact in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the thin wire or cord extending from the base of the left wing still present and connected to the wing structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible wire or cord extending from the wing structure. Image A clearly shows a wire or cord extending from the base of the left wing, but this element does not appear in the edited image. The absence of this component in Image B confirms the imagery has been altered to remove it.",

      "question": "Does the outfit retain the halter-neck silhouette with lace-like embroidery along the torso and arms, including the high waist and fitted form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates a dress with a halter-neck silhouette and visible lace-like embroidery along the torso and arms. The outfit retains its fitted form with a high waist design, similar to what is observed in Image A. Both images preserve the intricate details of the attire harmoniously.",

      "question": "Is the fairy depicted in a side profile pose, with her head slightly turned toward the viewer and her gaze directed forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fairy is depicted in a straightforward pose, not a side profile. Her head is not turned towards the viewer and her gaze appears more directed straight ahead rather than being slightly to the side as mentioned. The perspective angle in Image B lends a direct front-facing stance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the additional decorative elements like dangling beaded earrings are not visible. Image A displays earrings worn by the subject, but these are not featured in the edited image. The omission of such jewelry in Image B signifies a modification of the visual details.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features such as closed eyes and painted lips are obscured in Image B due to the masked or blurred depiction of the face. Image A shows painted red lips and closed eyes, but these aspects are absent in Image B. The lack of observable details regarding the face prevents confirming whether these features match the original appearance.",
