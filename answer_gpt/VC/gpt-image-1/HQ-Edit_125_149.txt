    "Question": "Q1: Is the river present beneath the bridge, flowing from the background toward the foreground with visible white water over mossy rocks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the river is visible flowing toward the foreground, but it is accompanied by a large creature rather than a bridge, as in Image A. The water flows over mossy rocks, visible near the creature's feet. This indicates the presence of a flowing river with white water, despite the significant changes in comparison to Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there moss-covered rocks visible in the river, especially near the center and right side of the frame?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a river with moss-covered rocks scattered throughout, similar to Image A, which has rocks in the river. The moss-covered rocks are quite prominent near the center of the creature in Image B, similar to their previous placement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are multiple fallen logs visible along the left and right riverbanks, some partially submerged in the water?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is one visible fallen log on the left side of the frame, along the riverbank. However, the logs are not as abundant or as partially submerged as they are in Image A, which features multiple logs along both banks. Hence, the characteristic of multiple logs as described in the question is not apparent in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a canopy of green leaves overhead, allowing dappled sunlight to filter down onto the bridge and river?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the overhead view features a dense forest environment with filtered sunlight. However, the bridge is not present; instead, there is a large creature under the canopy. Dappled sunlight filtering down fits the scene, but the bridge-specific detail is altered.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there several large, moss-covered tree trunks leaning toward the bridge from the left bank, with one prominently curving over the structure?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows large moss-covered tree trunks, some leaning, yet not specifically toward a bridge, as the bridge is replaced with a creature. The prominent curving tree trunk feature is notably less pronounced in Image B as compared to Image A, which has a distinct trunk arching over the bridge structure.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the image captured from a low-angle viewpoint, looking upward at the bridge from near the river level?",
    "explanation": "Image B is captured from a low-angle viewpoint, but instead of looking upward at a bridge, it offers an upward view of a large, towering creature from near the river level. This perspective gives a similar sense of scale, as in Image A, which employs a river-level viewpoint to emphasize the structure of the bridge above.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the bridge structure extend horizontally across the river, supported by towers on both sides, forming a continuous span?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not contain a bridge structure extending across the river. A large creature fills the space where the bridge should be, and no horizontal span of a bridge is present.",
    "answer": "No"
