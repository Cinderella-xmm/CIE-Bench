      "question": "Are the eyes almond-shaped with a downward gaze, maintaining their original proportion and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a cartoon-like character often referred to as 'chibi', characterized by exaggerated features, typically including larger eyes. However, due to the blur covering the face and the nature of 'chibi' art, it is not possible to confirm the specific eye shape or gaze orientation. Nevertheless, 'chibi' eyes are often drawn large and prominent, which do not necessarily adhere to almond shape or specific gaze orientation present in realistic depictions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the nose present with a visible bridge and tip, positioned centrally between the eyes and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In chibi style, facial features such as the nose are often simplified or even omitted entirely. The second image, consistent with a chibi style, does not show detailed facial features including a visible nose bridge or tip, as these are minimized or not included to focus on other aspects of the character design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the mouth have a subtle upward curve at the corners, forming a gentle smile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In chibi artworks, mouths are typically very simplified and may not adhere to realistic expressions like a subtle upward curve. Given the style and typical depiction in chibi art, without explicit detail due to the blur, it is unlikely that the mouth presents a subtle, realistic smile.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the subject seated cross-legged with knees bent and body leaning forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a character that appears to be sitting upright in a traditional pose, with a focus on cultural attire rather than a cross-legged sitting position. The subject is depicted in a way that emphasizes the ornate clothing rather than body posture, which appears not to be leaned forward but rather in a balanced or upright position due to the artistic style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a small gold stud earring visible in the left ear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows elaborate accessories, including what might be considered ear ornaments that are intricate and decorative. These details appear to extend beyond simple gold stud earrings, commonly including more ornate elements due to the traditional and stylized design present in this chibi art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the skin tone light to medium with natural undertones, consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In chibi art, the characters often have uniformly lighter skin tones for stylistic purposes. The depiction in Image B illustrates a lighter and more unified color palette, focusing on the art style rather than realistic skin tones, which does not directly translate to the natural undertones shown in realistic images.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the head tilted downward with the gaze directed forward and slightly down?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In chibi art, the character often has proportional differences compared to realistic depictions. While the head may appear larger or tilting, the gaze is generally simplified and doesn't adhere to a specific forward or downward direction as depicted in realistic imagery. Given the blurred coverage in this image, a precise directional gaze cannot be confirmed following these typical stylized characteristics.",
