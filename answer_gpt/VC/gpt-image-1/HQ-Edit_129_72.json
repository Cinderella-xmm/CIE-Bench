      "question": "Is the bird positioned in a side-facing profile, facing left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the bird is positioned in a profile view facing to the right. The prominent features of the bird, such as its beak, flame-like head feathers, and the orientation of its body, indicate that the bird is facing right. This indicates that the bird is not facing left.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's feet can be seen wrapped around and gripping the branch. This is evident by observing the way the talons are visibly engaged with the branch, which indicates a firm grip.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the main branch extends from the lower right towards the upper left. This is the opposite of the described direction from lower-left to upper-right, indicating that the branch does not extend in the specified orientation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are clusters of flame-like blossoms distributed along the side branches, suggesting multiple clusters of ‘blossoms’ which are portrayed as fiery elements. These fiery representations are positioned at various points along the branches.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows white snowflakes scattered uniformly across the sky background, indicating snowfall. This visual detail is consistent throughout Image B, blanketing the background as described.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the bird is positioned near the center of the composition, with fiery blossoms visible on both the left and right sides of the branches. This central placement of the bird and the distribution of blossoms on either side creates a balanced composition.",
