      "question": "Is the \"S\" emblem present on the chest of the character, with a shield shape, red outer border, yellow/gold inner field, and red \"S\" lettering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted as a chibi-style version of Superman. The visual cues show a cartoonish character with a shield-shaped emblem on the chest that features a red border and a central 'S.' In this illustration, the 'S' is presented with red coloring against a yellow/gold background. This is consistent with the traditional Superman emblem. Using my background knowledge of pop culture, this stylized depiction still retains the essential details of the Superman emblem.",
