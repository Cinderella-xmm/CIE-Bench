        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table structure is visible and matches the description of having multiple tiers with horizontal slats and vertical supports. This is evident from the clear view of the table's design, which resembles a workbench or artisan table.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two vases on the table, but their shapes are not identical to those in Image A. In Image B, the vases have a more polished and uniform appearance, unlike the asymmetrical and rough finish seen in the clay vases of Image A.",
      "weight": 3,

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does depict white fabric scraps similar to those in Image A. They are positioned on the table and appear to be part of the overall aesthetic, maintaining the element of fabric in the scene.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the flat wooden base supporting the entire structure still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure is supported by a flat wooden base. This is evident as the arrangement is enclosed in a glass dome and clearly shows the base beneath the decorative elements.",
