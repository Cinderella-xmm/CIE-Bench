      "question": "Are the gingham accents on the cuffs and back bow still present and crisp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gingham pattern is visible on the cuffs and the bow at the neck. The pattern looks clean and well-defined, indicating that the accents are indeed present and crisp. The gingham design commonly appears as checkered squares, and this visual detail is maintained in the edited image, showing its clarity and condition.",

      "question": "Does the dress retain its original structure with long sleeves, a gathered waistline, and a flared skirt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a dress with similar structural elements: long sleeves, a gathered waist, and a flared skirt. These are components recognizable through common garment design features. The visual cues show the dress has kept its basic silhouette and design, consistent with what is expected of such a garment style.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the \"Nebraska Huskers\" text area still located in the same position on the dress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original text, 'Nebraska Huskers,' has been replaced with 'Corn Princess.' However, the position of the text remains on the upper part of the dress, consistent with typical garment branding placement. Comparing this spatial arrangement with common clothing design, the logical placement for text remains unchanged.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the dress predominantly red, even if the shade has been deepened?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a dress with its dominant color being red, albeit appearing deeper than in Image A. The perception of color depth can vary based on image processing but remains within the red spectrum. This characteristic aligns with general dress color principles where the primary color persists regardless of shade variations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the dress still have a gathered waistline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress exhibits a gathered detail at the waist, which is apparent by the visible folds beneath the bodice. This aligns with standard dress styles where such a feature contributes to fit and flare designs by providing volume at the skirt through gathering techniques, thereby confirming the waistline remains gathered.",
