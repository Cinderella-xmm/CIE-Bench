    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a raised platform beneath the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building appears to be sitting on a base that seems elevated from the surrounding ground. This can be inferred from the shadows and the steps leading up to the building, giving the appearance of a raised platform characteristic of architectural designs that utilize elevation for prominence or protection from elements.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a still water surface directly in front of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B indicate that there is a pool of water in front of the building. The water surface is calm and reflects the structure above it, suggesting a still water body, which is common in architectural designs for aesthetic appeal and symmetry.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the building have multiple horizontal tiers stacked vertically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building displays a clear architectural style featuring several horizontal sections or tiers stacked vertically. This tiered design is reminiscent of layered structures often seen in historical or futuristic architecture.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the building positioned centrally above the water pool on a raised platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the building directly above the water pool, with the reflection indicating a central alignment. The observation of a platform makes it likely that the structure is intentionally positioned at the center for visual impact or architectural symmetry.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sky dark blue with scattered stars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B is depicted as a deep, dark blue with stars scattered across it. This setting evokes a night scene commonly used to create a serene and contemplative atmosphere in artistic renders.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there trees arranged symmetrically on both sides of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are trees positioned on either side of the building. Their symmetrical arrangement aligns with typical landscaping practices that aim to balance and enhance architectural beauty by framing the main structure.",
