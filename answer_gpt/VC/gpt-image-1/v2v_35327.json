      "question": "Is the figureâ€™s skin uniformly colored in a vivid blue tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's skin is depicted with a vivid blue tone, which covers both the head and the visible hand. The blue tone is uniformly applied as part of the overall painted style of the image, which gives it an artistic, almost oil-painting appearance with distinct brush strokes and swirling patterns.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the banana rendered in a metallic gold color with a curved, elongated shape resembling a real banana?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the banana is depicted in a metallic gold color with a curvature and elongated shape that closely resembles a real banana. The color and shape are consistent with a creative and abstract portrayal rather than a realistic photographic representation, aligning with the overall artistic theme of the image.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, ears) clearly visible and anatomically recognizable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's facial features are not clearly visible due to the blurred face area. The rest of the image focuses on the artistic representation with swirling patterns, and while an ear is partially visible, the detail and clarity needed to recognize other facial features are obstructed.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the hand visible and positioned near the banana, suggesting a prior or ongoing interaction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand is visibly positioned near the banana, with fingers partly wrapped around it, suggesting some form of interaction. This gives the impression of the hand holding or having just placed the banana.",

    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is depicted in a side profile with the head angled slightly forward, facing to the right side of the image. This positioning aligns with the traditional side profile view where the shape of the head and neck are clear.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a background behind the figure, even if it is transformed or warped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of swirling patterns and abstract elements that complement the artistic style of the image. This textured backdrop creates a sense of depth and movement, giving the impression of a transformed or dynamic background.",
