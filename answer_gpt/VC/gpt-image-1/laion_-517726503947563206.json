      "question": "Is the text \"Aurora\" visible on the side of the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship is depicted with a crystalline structure resembling an ornate fairy-tale castle, but there is no visible text on the side of the ship such as 'Aurora'. This conclusion is drawn by closely examining the visual details of the ship and noting the lack of any textural elements that would indicate lettering or names on the vessel.",

      "question": "Is the registration number \"QV-8880\" visible on the hull of the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a ship with intricate crystalline and jewel-like patterns but lacks any numerical or textual identifiers like 'QV-8880' on the hull. Conversely, these identifiers are typically visible on conventional ships for identification purposes, but in this fantasy or artistic depiction, such details are absent.",

      "question": "Is a red flag visible at the top of the shipâ€™s mast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top region of the ship in Image B is adorned with crystal spires and domes without any flags visible. The ornate details focus on architecture rather than nautical elements like flags. Therefore, upon examining the mast or top structure, one would not find a red flag.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the ship in a side profile view, similar to conventional presentations for the ship's broad characteristics and structural design, with its front facing toward the right side of the image. This orientation allows a comprehensive view of the ship's decorative architectural details on its side.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship appears to be floating on a calm body of water, as indicated by its reflection and its placement in the environment which enhances the realism of the ship's positioning on water despite its fantastical design.",
