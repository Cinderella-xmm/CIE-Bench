      "question": "Is the green-shaded desk lamp present on the right side of the desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a distinct depiction of a green-shaded desk lamp located on the right side of the open book. This is evident by the lamp's familiar shape and color common in desk lamps used in library settings, especially the traditional styling with a green shade. This visual cue matches common design choices for desk lamps, aiding in the clear identification.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, Image B, a tall window with a grid pattern can be identified in the background on the left side.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the figure interacting with an open book placed directly in front of them on the desk. The color and texture of the pages indicate aging or extensive use, as yellowing is common in older books or documents. This observation aligns with typical historical or aged settings.",

      ],

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts the figure seated at the desk with a posture indicative of reading or studying—the body is leaning slightly forward toward the open book. Such a posture is consistent with someone engaged in reading.",

      "question": "Is the desk made of wood with visible grain texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the desk is clearly represented through illustration, the detail does not extend to a realistic granular wood texture. The stylized depiction leaves the surface texture generalized. Although the desk is shown, its texture details are insufficiently rendered to confirm a wood grain.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure has a visual hairstyle featuring a bun. However, no loose strands are depicted falling near the face; the dark hair is stylized and drawn cleanly pulled back without additional detail or complexity.",
