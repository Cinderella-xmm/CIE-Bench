      "question": "Are the almond-shaped eyes with visible dark eyeliner and defined lashes present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image showcases a style typical of historical paintings with an emphasis on elaborate clothing and hairstyles rather than detailed facial features. Consequently, specific details like almond-shaped eyes, dark eyeliner, and defined lashes are not depicted. Thus, it is evident that the edited image does not display these features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the woman smiling with visible upper teeth in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In historical-style art, subtle and closed-mouth expressions are more common, reflecting the norms of the era being depicted. This style would typically not show exaggerated expressions such as visible upper teeth when smiling. Therefore, in the edited image, the woman is not shown smiling with visible upper teeth.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the nose with a straight bridge and rounded tip present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image follows traditional portraiture where fine facial details such as the exact shape of the nose—straight bridge and rounded tip—are typically not accentuated or clearly visible. Given this style, the facial features are generally soft and less defined, making it unlikely that such a specific detail is present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the woman have light skin with a warm undertone in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image portrays a woman with light skin consistent with the style of historic European portraiture, which often included a slight warm undertone to depict a gentle and noble appearance. Thus, it can be concluded that the woman in the edited image does have light skin with a warm undertone.",
      "weight": 2,

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the woman's body silhouette consistent with the original — upright, slender build, and proportional limbs — in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the woman's posture is elegant and upright, consistent with the historical art style that emphasizes grace. The silhouette is visibly slender with proportional limbs, similar to the original's posture and body shape.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is a silver necklace with a small pendant visible around the woman’s neck in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, a necklace, commonly worn in historical-style portraits, is discernible; however, these images rarely focus on small detailed accessories such as tiny pendants. The specific visibility of a silver necklace with a small pendant detail is not clear without an evident focus on such jewelry.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the woman’s dark brown hair visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The edited image suggests a historical setting where elaborate wigs or stylized hair designs replace the natural hairstyle. The use of white and voluminous hairstyles in such art styles typically obscures any indication of the woman’s original dark brown hair color.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
