    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the vertical white \"Under Armour\" logo clearly visible on the outer side of the calf, maintaining its original font, spacing, and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is constructed with a blocky, pixelated appearance, seemingly made of LEGO bricks. While the general position of the upper portion of the sock seems to have the vertical logo, the detail and clarity are compromised due to the blocky representation, making it difficult to ascertain if the logo maintains its original font, spacing, and orientation. The original clear and distinct design of printed logos does not translate well to this blocky interpretation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there an orange tag with a black Under Armour logo located at the top edge of the sock cuff?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an orange element at the top edge of the sock, resembling a LEGO piece. While it seems to represent the orange tag from Image A, the distinctness of a logo, especially the specific Under Armour logo, is not discernible due to the blocky appearance. The ability to recognize the logo depends on fine details that are lost in this representation.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the stylized \"UA\" logo present on the ankle section of the sock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the blocky nature, identifying small, detailed logos such as the stylized 'UA' is challenging. The ankle section does not visibly show a clear 'UA' logo as seen in conventional designs, and any detailing is hard to confirm given the pixel-like construction, which loses small, intricate details.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the gray and white geometric patterns on the foot and shin area preserved in their original positions and color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall placement and color scheme of gray and white patterns appears somewhat consistent with original geometric placements but is interpreted as blocky designs. The transformation into a LEGO representation means exact positions and clear patterns cannot be precisely defined but general forms might be retained.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the gray reinforced sections on the heel and toe maintained in their original shape and location?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a LEGO-style construction that retains the stronger contrast areas suggestive of reinforced areas similar to common sock designs; however, precise shapes and locations cannot be exactly the same due to the blocky structure though the general color is indicated.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Is the small text printed vertically along the lower leg of the sock still visible and in its original position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the nature of the LEGO representation, small text elements which require detailed clarity are not visible. LEGO blocks are not suited to depict small, exact details like printed text, hence it would not be visible or preserved.",
