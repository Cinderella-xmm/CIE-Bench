    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the mountain depicted as a symmetrical, perfectly conical shape with a pointed peak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain is contained within a glass dome, resembling a conically shaped peak with snow on top, reflecting a symmetrical and perfectly conical form. Given that it is designed as a miniature representation, common sense suggests it portrays an idealized version of a mountain, typically with such symmetry and pointedness.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the summit of the mountain have a continuous white snow cap covering the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a miniature mountain inside a dome with the summit capped in white. This resembles continuous snow coverage. Such a design indicates a simplified but comprehensive representation of snow-capped peaks.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a clear, mirror-like reflection of the mountain in the lake below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the representation of the mountain includes a reflection in the water beneath it. The precision of this design suggests a mirror-like reflection is intended, as it aligns with the artistic representation commonly used in glass domes.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there small structures or buildings positioned along the edge of the lake, between the water and the mountain base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are small structures visible in the edited image, positioned along the lake just above its edge. This placement reflects common placements seen in real-world landscapes around mountains, fitting within the style of such miniature designs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sky visible above the mountain, appearing as a solid or gradient blue area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background setting appears to have the mountain placed within a dome without visible sky above it. The visual design confines the mountain, thereby omitting any view of the sky that would usually be depicted in landscape scenarios of mountains.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible layers on the mountainâ€™s slopes, showing a transition from white snow at the top to darker rock and then to green/brown vegetation below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mountain in Image B transitions visibly from the snow-covered peak to green vegetation below, without visible rock layers between. Common representations in miniature or artistic versions often skip rocky layers for simplicity, focusing instead on clear vegetation transitions.",
