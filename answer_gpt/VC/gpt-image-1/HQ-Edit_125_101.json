      "question": "Is the dancer depicted in an arabesque leap with one leg extended behind and arms forming a diagonal line?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is inside a snow globe posed in a graceful ballet position, which is not an arabesque leap. An arabesque leap typically involves one leg extended behind the dancer's body, whereas in Image B, the leg is raised higher and does not form a typical arabesque. Additionally, the arms do not form a diagonal line as they would in a classic arabesque pose.",
