    "Question": "Q1: Is the facial moko kauae tattoo pattern with symmetrical spirals and angular lines clearly visible and intact, covering the forehead, cheeks, and chin?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the face of the character is illustrated with exaggerated features such as the protruding tongue, but it features bold and stylized moko tattoo designs commonly seen in Māori culture, including spirals on the cheeks and forehead. However, the design is different from a typical moko kauae as it does not cover the chin area accurately. Therefore, while the illustration does incorporate tattoo patterns, it does not follow the traditional intac design exactly, resulting in a playful interpretation.",
