      "question": "Is the girl’s mouth visibly open with red lips and rosy cheeks, indicating she is blowing bubbles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl's face is intentionally blurred, making it difficult to discern specific facial features such as the mouth position or lip color. Without this information, it is impossible to confirm if her mouth is open or if she has red lips and rosy cheeks. Thus, we cannot ascertain if she is blowing bubbles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the pink bubble wand held in the girl’s right hand, with its loop facing outward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl is holding a wand in her right hand, but due to the artistic and whimsical style of the image, combined with some blurring of the hand area, the precise color and orientation are not distinctly visible. Therefore, we cannot verify if it is a pink bubble wand held with its loop facing outward.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is a yellow cylindrical bottle held in the girl’s left hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there isn't a clearly visible cylindrical bottle that can be identified in the girl’s left hand. The image focuses more on the fantasy elements and the blue glowing orbs/lanterns that may conceptually represent bubbles, therefore a yellow bottle is not apparent.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the girl have long, wavy black hair with bangs covering her forehead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl features long, flowing wavy hair, and the artistic representation suggests it is black or dark in color. However, due to the blurred face, it is not possible to determine if bangs cover her forehead.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the dress designed with off-the-shoulder straps and puffy ruffled sleeves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress is creatively illustrated to blend with the fantasy theme, designed to resemble flower petals, which wrap around the girl's torso. There are no distinct off-the-shoulder straps or puffy ruffled sleeves in the conventional sense; the design is more unique and artistic.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the girl shown in a side profile with her head tilted slightly upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl appears in a side profile with her head slightly turned, facing the glowing orb/lantern, which is akin to her head being tilted upward. The artistic style conveys this pose effectively.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are bubbles (or lanterns) emerging from the girl’s mouth in the direction of the wand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, glowing orbs or lanterns are depicted, which serve as a thematic metaphor for bubbles. These orbs are positioned artistically around the girl, but the blurred area conceals whether they specifically emerge from her mouth. The style implies directionality towards the orbs, but does not explicitly show them originating from the girl's mouth.",
