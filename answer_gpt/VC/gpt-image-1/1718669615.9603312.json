      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the presence of two parallel railway tracks extending into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no presence of railway tracks at all. Instead, the image shows a pattern and a stylized vase, which doesnâ€™t resemble railway tracks or any transportation infrastructure. This confirms the absence of railway tracks extending into the distance.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the railway track visibly curved to the right as it recedes into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the features do not illustrate any railway track or its direction. The image comprises a decorative vase with geometric patterns and wavy lines underneath, none of which align with the characteristics or curvature typical of railway tracks.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the UFO positioned directly above the central axis of the railway track?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks any depiction of a UFO or railway tracks. It portrays a vase instead. The concept of position above a central axis is not applicable here, since no UFO or tracks are present.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a clear horizontal line separating the sky from the land in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a decorative design rich with patterns. The sky and land concept is not applicable because there is neither a sky nor land represented, just motifs that extend throughout. The absence of such elements negates any horizontal separation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the railway track visibly elevated above the surrounding ground level?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include a railway track to demonstrate elevation relative to ground level. It consists of cultural design patterns with no relation to railway tracks or elevation depiction.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the railway tracks converge toward a single point on the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains artistic patterns and does not represent railway tracks or a horizon where convergence can occur. It displays an unbroken design with fluid lines and stylistic marking without insinuating linear convergence typical of tracks.",
