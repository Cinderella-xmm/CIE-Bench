    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the stylized illustration retain the scalloped pattern on the wings and back, with alternating dark and light feather edges forming a scale-like texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird illustration shows a stylized pattern on the wings and back. This pattern resembles scalloping or a scale-like texture with visible alternating dark and light areas. This design imitates the intricate feather edge details commonly seen in bird illustrations and suggests an artistic interpretation aimed at capturing this aspect in a simplified manner, characteristic of stylized illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the breast and throat area rendered in a consistent peach-orange hue, distinct from the darker upper body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's breast and throat area are presented in a uniform peach-orange color, which clearly contrasts with the darker shades of the upper body seen in stylized illustrations. This consistent coloring can denote the underpart color in bird illustrations, aiming to distinguish different body areas.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the beak long, straight, and uniformly black, extending from the face without curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bird with a long, straight, black beak extending from its face. The lack of curvature suggests an artistic simplification typical in stylized depictions where shapes are rendered more uniformly compared to natural variations, aligning with common characteristics of bird beaks.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a clearly defined dark eye positioned near the center of the head, surrounded by lighter skin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bird in Image B has a prominently marked dark eye located centrally on the head, surrounded by a lighter hue that contrasts well, showing a typical representation seen in stylized animal illustrations where key anatomical features are accentuated to enhance recognizability.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the legs dark gray-black and do they end in three forward-facing toes with visible claws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's legs are depicted as dark gray or black. The depiction shows three forward-facing toes with visible claws, conforming to a common portrayal in animal illustrations where critical anatomical features like legs and feet are highlighted with simpler, contrasting colors.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the bird depicted in a standing posture, with legs fully extended and body upright, as if on a shoreline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the bird in an upright stance with extended legs, simulating a standing posture. The background gives an impression of a shoreline context, consistent with explorative themes where animals like birds are shown in their natural, observable habitats.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there small tufts of beach grass and scattered pebbles visible in the foreground beneath the birdâ€™s feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground is simplified and lacks detailed features such as beach grass or pebbles around the bird's feet. This pared-down setting often characterizes stylized illustrations meant for packaging where attention is focused on the main subject with minimal complex surroundings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is there a clear transition from the warm peach-orange underparts to the darker, mottled upper body and wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a distinct transition in coloring from the warm peach-orange underparts to the darker upper body. This is a typical design approach to visually segregate different body sections in illustrations, making the transition noticeable, which helps in identifying bird species or accentuating stylistic contrasts.",
