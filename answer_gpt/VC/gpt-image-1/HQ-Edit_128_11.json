        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an illustration depicting a grand piano with an open lid placed in the center of a stage.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration does not emphasize the material of the stage floor or reflections. The style of the illustration is more focused on an artistic representation rather than realistic details such as reflections or the texture of the floor.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ceiling is depicted in an illustration with intricate details, but it does not show the specific elements such as a painted fresco with floral motifs. The artistic nature of the illustration simplifies the complex designs present in the actual photograph, focusing instead on a more uniform depiction. Therefore, the presence of such detailed motifs is not discernible.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an illustrated chandelier suspended from the center of the ceiling. While the chandelier is depicted with a notable presence, the specifics about it being composed of multiple tiers of crystals and candle-like lights are not clearly conveyed due to the illustration's style, which lacks detailed realism.",
