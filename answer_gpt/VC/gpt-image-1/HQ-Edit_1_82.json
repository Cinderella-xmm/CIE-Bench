        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the logo on the balance beam appears as abstract illustrations and no visible text like 'GIOROUR' is present. In contrast, Image A shows the 'GIOROUR' logo clearly on the balance beam, which is a branding usually visible in sports imagery related to events. This indicates understanding of typical logo placements and visibility in competitive settings.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central illustration shows a gymnast on the beam with a raised leg and foot, not both feet firmly on the beam surface. This posture is consistent with artistic balance poses shown in illustrations, suggesting movement and elegance. In Image A, the gymnast is clearly standing with one foot on the beam and the other leg raised parallel, indicating a different moment captured during performance.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floor beneath the beam is not detailed as a blue mat; instead, the focus is on the artistic representation of the balance beam itself and the gymnast figures. In Image A, the blue floor mat is visible below the balance beam as expected in a gymnastic competition setting providing a safety measure for athletes.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict any text or logos such as 'GOTS' on the support legs. The legs in the illustrations are minimized to focus on the gymnast and beam, typical of an art based representation. Image A has the 'GOTS' text visible on the blue support leg, which is common in actual gymnastic event scenes where equipment branding might appear.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is solely on three gymnasts depicted as art illustrations in different poses around a single beam, making them the main subjects without crowd or other athletes context. Image A clearly shows multiple gymnasts performing near the beam as is typical in gymnastic events, providing context to the competitive environment.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the hair in the artistic representation styled in a bun, but without a visible red hair tie. This focuses on aesthetic interpretation consistent with illustration norms where such specific details might not be included. Image A shows the gymnast with a bun and visible red hair tie, often used in real-life scenarios for managing long hair during performances.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustrations show a balance beam on legs that are artistically indicative but not overtly featuring detailed blue support structure. In Image A, the beam clearly rests on two blue support legs which are standard in depiction of gymnastic equipment.",
