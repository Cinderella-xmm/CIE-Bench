    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the man's left arm still wrapped around the woman's back, supporting her in a ballroom dance hold?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's entire left arm is visible, and it is positioned at a more formal upright posture typical in historical or classical dance depictions, resting at the waist level rather than wrapping around the woman's back for support. This is different from the more contemporary ballroom hold usually seen in dance competitions.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the woman's right hand remain on the man's left shoulder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's arms are positioned closer together in a more ceremonial or formal stance associated with historical dance contexts, rather than being placed on the man's shoulder. This reflects an older style of dance where the hold focuses on maintaining grace and formality.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the woman's back arched backward with her right leg lifted off the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's posture is upright, fitting a historical or classical context, not exhibiting the dynamics of a contemporary ballroom dance with an arched back and leg raised off the ground.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the man positioned with his back to the viewer while the woman faces slightly toward the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the man and the woman are facing each other directly rather than having the man’s back to the viewer. This orientation is more balanced towards the viewer, common in classical dance representations.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the woman's long blonde hair flow outward to the right side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's long hair is depicted flowing slightly backward but maintained within the decorum of a classic style portrait setting, typical in historical depictions, and not flowing outward dramatically as observed in an action shot.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the man's left foot forward and the woman's right heel raised off the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dance pose depicted is more reserved, typical of historical dance art, with the man’s left foot extended forward, underpinning classical dance movements. The woman's pose does not prominently involve a lifted heel, distinct from dynamic modern dance poses.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the woman's head tilted upward with her eyes looking toward the upper left of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's head is slightly tilted upward, conveying a stately elegance common in historical settings, effectively suggesting an upward glance typical in art from historical periods, but not specifically directed to the upper left of the frame.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
