      "question": "Does the zebra retain its black-and-white stripe pattern without significant alteration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's traditional black-and-white stripe pattern is visible and intact. These stripes are a defining characteristic of zebras, offering camouflage in the wild. The visual cue of the stripes being clear and undistorted aligns with common knowledge about zebras, therefore there has been no significant alteration to this pattern.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the zebra still in its original standing posture facing slightly towards the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra stands with its body orientation facing more towards the left side of the frame rather than the right. This is deduced from the head-to-body orientation and position. This posture is different compared to what is seen as a more right-facing stance typically, indicating a notable change.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the second zebra partially visible behind the first one, preserving its placement in the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a second zebra is indeed partially visible behind the first one, consistent with the initial placement where a second zebra was similarly partially visible. This helps in maintaining the depth and context of the scene's composition.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the image still feature a grassy savannah background with some scattered vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a city street background with urban elements, such as buildings and pavement, rather than a natural, grassy savannah with vegetation. This drastic change from a natural to an urban setting is a clear indicator that the background has been altered.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the zebras' relative sizes, proportions, and perspectives maintained as seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the zebras in Image B maintain realistic proportions typical of their species, suggesting no alteration in size and relative proportions, the change in background may affect perception of perspective. The zebras appear in fitting scale to their urban surroundings, which matches the spatial context, similar to their natural surrounding perspective in Image A.",
