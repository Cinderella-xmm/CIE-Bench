    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes positioned symmetrically within the face, with a slight upward slant at the outer edges and gazing directly forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the blurred nature of the face, it is impossible to ascertain the specific positioning and characteristics of the eyes. The blur prevents any detailed visual analysis or recognition of symmetry, positioning, or slant of the eyes.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the nose have a straight bridge and a slightly rounded tip, aligned centrally between the eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurring effect applied to the face obscures the details necessary to assess the characteristics of the nose, such as the bridge shape or tip alignment. Thus, it cannot be determined if the nose has the described features.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the lips thin, closed, and slightly upturned at the corners, forming a neutral yet thoughtful expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blur on the face makes it impossible to visualize the lips clearly, so characteristics such as thickness, closure, or expression cannot be evaluated through direct observation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the face proportionally balanced, with equal spacing between the eyes and symmetrical distribution of facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurring over the face precludes the ability to accurately evaluate the proportional balance of facial features such as eye spacing or overall symmetry.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the left ear partially visible, emerging from under the hair near the temple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artistic style blends elements and focuses more on the expressionistic portrayal rather than precise anatomical details. The ear is not distinguishable through the curl of the hair; therefore, it's unclear if it is partially visible or not.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there soft shadows along the right side of the face and under the jawline, created by directional lighting from the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blur across the face obscures any subtle lighting effects such as shadows that would indicate directionality of light on the face, preventing such an analysis.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the head centered above the shoulders, with no unnatural tilt or rotation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The head appears centered relative to the detailed framing provided by the visible shoulders and decorative attire in the artwork, suggesting a balanced and upright position without an unnatural tilt or rotation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    }
