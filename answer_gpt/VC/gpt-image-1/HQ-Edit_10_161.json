      "question": "Does the dress retain the exact geometric pattern of orange-brown diamonds with spiral centers on a turquoise blue background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dress with identical geometric patterns of orange-brown diamonds with spiral centers on a turquoise blue background as observed in Image A. The mosaic style in Image B keeps these patterns intact, even though colors and texture have been artistically rendered.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beads' arrangement retains the sequence of colors: red, white, yellow, and black, which corresponds with the bead sequence in Image A. The artistic rendering of Image B does not alter this particular sequence.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The braids in Image B do maintain an upward-coiled crown-like structure originating from the scalp similar to Image A. The artistic and mosaic appearance in Image B accurately preserves this structural detail.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
