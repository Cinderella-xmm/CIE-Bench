    "Question": "Q1: Is the subject’s left leg raised and held behind her back with both hands?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure in the middle card is sitting in a cross-legged position, and the figure on the left card is standing with her hands in a prayer position. The right card shows a figure in a downward facing pose with hands touching the ground. None of these depict a left leg raised and held behind the back with both hands, which would be a more complex yoga pose requiring both hands to grasp the foot or ankle of the raised leg.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the sun located directly behind the subject’s torso, forming a halo-like glow around her silhouette?",
    "explanation": "Image B consists of a set of yoga cards that illustrate different poses. The first card on the left shows the sun behind the figure's head, and the middle and right cards have the sun positioned more free-floating, not directly behind the torso of any central figure. The sun's placement is more of a background element rather than a halo effect.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the beach surface visibly wet, showing reflections of the sun and ocean waves?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not clearly show a beach surface that reflects wetness. The cards only depict illustrated representations of yoga poses with artistic backgrounds and do not focus on detailed characteristics like reflections or wet surfaces. The environment setting within the cards is more stylized.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there two distinct rocky landforms visible in the background, one on the left and one on the right side of the frame?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cards show simplified ocean and sun backdrops, but there are no distinct rocky landforms visible in the background within these illustrations. The focus seems to be on the sun and ocean rather than any geological features.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the subject standing barefoot on the sand, with the sole of her right foot flat against the ground?",
    "explanation": "Image B features stylized drawings of yoga poses on cards. While some figures may resemble standing poses, the depiction lacks clear details like bare feet on sand or highlighting the posture and grounding of the sole on a beach.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the subject’s hair tied into a neat bun at the back of her head?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figures on the yoga cards have their hair styled into buns, which could be inferred as neat given the simplified and consistent artistic styling in these illustrations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the subject’s head tilted upward, with her face angled toward the sky?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, none of the figures depicted have their heads tilted upward towards the sky; rather, they have neutral or downward-facing head orientations, corresponding to their respective yoga poses shown on the cards.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Are there visible ocean waves breaking along the shoreline in front of the subject?",
    "explanation": "Image B features simplified illustrations in a series, where the presence of ocean themes is seen in the background behind the figures, but they do not focus on differentiated elements like ocean waves breaking. The art style uses gradients and soft colors conveying a serene atmosphere instead of detailed waves.",
    "answer": "No"
