      "question": "Is the figure in the top-right corner still shown with its right arm raised high, holding a weapon aloft?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure in the top-right corner does have its right arm raised, holding a weapon similar to an axe. This decision draws from the positioning of the arm, elevated above the shoulder level, indicating that the weapon is being held aloft. This reflects the posture commonly seen in figures prepared for action. The comparison with Image A further confirms the consistency in arm position and weapon type, which in Image A is also an axe held high. The continuity of positioning in both images supports that they are displayed in a similar manner.",

      "question": "Does the figure in the bottom-left corner still show a hand gripping a curved blade in its right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure in the bottom-left corner holds an axe-like weapon, which is not a curved blade but rather a straight-handled axe with a pronounced blade on one side. Image A features a figure in a similar pose holding a curved blade, with the hand clearly wrapped around the blade handle. The visual transformation from a curved blade in Image A to an axe-like weapon in Image B indicates a change in weapon style, thus answering the query with 'No,' reflecting the alteration accurately.",

      "question": "Is the figure in the bottom-left corner still in a kneeling position with one knee on the ground and the other leg bent forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure in the bottom-left corner is standing with knees bent but both feet firmly placed on what appears to be sandy ground. This stance marks a shift from the kneeling posture described in Image A, where one knee is on the ground, lending it a more grounded presence. The visual cues, including foot placement and knee positions in both images, clearly indicate a change from kneeling to a standing position, and common knowledge of body posture confirms this analysis.",

      "question": "Does the figure in the top-left corner still face slightly to the left with its head turned toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of the figure in the top-left corner does show its body facing leftwards, with the head appearing to be turned slightly towards the viewer. This is in line with observations from Image A, where the figure also demonstrates a similar orientation of body and head. The consistent head turning style from both images illustrates the retention of this visual characteristic, as aligned by facial direction and figure orientation.",

      "question": "Does the figure in the bottom-right corner still hold a long, vertical weapon in its right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure in the bottom-right corner holds a weapon vertically, resembling a spear or similar implement, positioned by its side. In both Image A and B, the verticality of the weapon is a clear element, implying a continuity in carrying style, drawn from the vertical positioning and grasp, typically associated with spear-like objects. This observation facilitates the conclusion that the figure in Image B maintains this aspect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the left leg of the top-right figure still bent backward, supporting a forward lunge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of the top-right figure's legs does not indicate a backward bend supporting a lunge, but instead shows an upright posture without pronounced leg bending. Image A shows a leg posture indicative of movement, with leg bent backward to suggest dynamic positioning. The change from an apparent action-supported lunge in Image A to a more stable stance in Image B reveals a difference in movement indication between the images. Thus, the analysis concludes this change accurately.",

      "question": "Is there a skull-shaped pendant visible around the neck of the bottom-right figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a skull-shaped object does appear prevalently around the neck area of the bottom-right figure, serving as a decorative item. This is similar to Image A, where a skull-shaped pendant is present, suggesting continuity in accessory styling between the two figures. The recurrent motif helps confirm its ongoing presence, drawing from accessory placement and style familiarity.",
