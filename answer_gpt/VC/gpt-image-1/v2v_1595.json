      "question": "Does the soccer ball retain exactly 12 black pentagonal panels and 20 white hexagonal panels arranged in a spherical configuration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the soccer ball is portrayed in a pop art style with visible panels that suggest a typical soccer ball design. However, the arrangement and exact count of panels are indistinct due to the stylized representation. Commonly, a classic soccer ball design features 12 black pentagonal panels and 20 white hexagonal panels, but the depiction does not permit counting them due to overlapping and graphic style constraints.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the soccer ball depicted as a three-dimensional sphere with curved surfaces and proper perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer ball is represented in a pop art style that emphasizes graphics over realistic three-dimensional qualities. Although the ball appears rounded, the focus is on stylized flat graphics rather than rendering realistic curvature and perspective typical of 3D objects.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the goalpost maintain a rectangular frame with two vertical posts and one horizontal crossbar forming a standard goal shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the goalpost forms a frame with a visual suggestion of two vertical posts and a horizontal crossbar, which aligns with the typical structure of a soccer goal. Despite being stylized, the essential rectangular shape is preserved visually.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the net of the goalpost composed of a visible grid pattern of intersecting lines forming square or rectangular cells?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the goal's net appears with intersecting lines that form a distinct grid pattern, consisting of square or rectangular shapes. This depiction is consistent with the typical grid arrangement found in soccer goal nets.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the soccer ball positioned in the foreground, in front of the goalpost, with part of the goal visible behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the soccer ball larger and forward in relation to the goalpost, indicative of a foreground position. The goalpost and net can be seen behind the ball, indicating the orientation is as described.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the seams between the black and white panels of the soccer ball clearly visible and aligned with the edges of the pentagons and hexagons?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction in Image B is stylized, where the seams between panels are implied through contrasting colors but are not intricately detailed or aligned clearly due to the artistic representation. The pop art method does not emphasize exact seam alignment.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the soccer ball centered in the foreground and the goalpost positioned directly behind it in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon viewing Image B, the soccer ball is positioned prominently in the foreground, giving a central aspect visually. The goalpost is aligned behind, reinforcing the ball's centered positioning relative to the goal frame in the background.",
