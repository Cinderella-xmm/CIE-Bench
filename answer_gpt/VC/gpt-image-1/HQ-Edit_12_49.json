    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the baroque-style scrollwork and acanthus leaf motifs present and accurately reproduced in the same positions and forms as in the original clock frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the box containing the watch features the baroque-style scrollwork and acanthus leaf motifs that are visually similar to the ornate frame surrounding the clock in Image A. The designs have been applied to the edges of the box, reflecting a consistent replication of the motifs, although adapted for a different form factor. Through visual inspection, these motifs are thus present in both images, appearing prominently as decorative elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the symmetrical arrangement of the top and bottom finials and side scrollwork preserved exactly as in the original clock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch box shows the presence of baroque-style decoration. However, it does not form the same symmetrical pattern as observed in the vertical alignment of the clock's top and bottom finials as well as side scrollwork in Image A. The motifs in the box are adapted for a cubical form, thus disrupting and changing the original arrangement present in the clock frame.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the rich mahogany tone and visible wood grain texture of the frame preserved in the packaging design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a watch box utilizing a similar rich mahogany color as the clock frame from Image A. However, the box lacks the visible wood grain texture, presenting a polished finish instead. This subtle difference marks a departure from the detailed texture that characterizes the clock frame, focusing more on ornate design elements.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the distressed gold finish of the clock face preserved in the watch face within the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The watch face in Image B continues with a distressed gold look that resembles the aged appearance of the clock face in Image A. Despite being smaller in scale, the golden texture is similarly distributed, suggesting a consistent visual theme between these items.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the black Roman numerals (Iâ€“XII) present in the same positions and style as in the original clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The watch in Image B features black Roman numerals placed in positions that mirror the traditional clock face layout seen in Image A. The style and arrangement maintain fidelity to the classic design characterized by these numerals, ensuring visual continuity.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the inscriptions \"2010\" and \"2012\" present in the same positions on the clock/watch face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the watch face includes inscriptions different from those on the original clock face in Image A, where '2010' and '2012' are distinctly present. The watch instead features 'DODI' and '2024', indicating a change in inscription, although remaining within a similar typographic context.",
