      "question": "Is the lion’s head medallion present at the center of the desk's front panel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues from Image B, the center of the desk's front panel features decorative patterns but does not distinctly show a lion’s head medallion. My world knowledge regarding decorative furniture suggests that such embellishments are often exquisite or symbolic additions on vintage furniture, yet in Image B, the usual visual indication of a lion's head shape isn't identifiable. Comparing Image A, where a lion's head medallion is distinctly visible, highlights this absence in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the quill maintain its feather shape, even if stylized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a stylized depiction of a quill above the title suggesting writing or stationery themes. The quill exhibits an elongated and shaped feather, congruent with common depictions of quills used in writing. World knowledge about quill pens, which use the feather’s natural shape, supports this understanding. Comparing with Image A, a realistic feather quill is visually evident near the desk.",

      "question": "Is the book depicted as open, showing two pages of aged, yellowed paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting is more abstract, showing an image of a stationery set with a stack of paper and an ink bottle, rather than an open book. Based on common stationery set representations, this is consistent. Image A depicts an open book with aged paper visible on a grand lectern, highlighting that this feature isn't present in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the desk retain its dark wood texture and finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently displays a desk motif with similar detail and finish as dark wood furniture, even though it is stylized to match a package design. Knowledge of vintage furniture suggests such desk motifs are designed to evoke classic aesthetics. Image A confirms a similar texture and finish, demonstrating consistency in color and material depiction.",

      "question": "Is the arched window with a grid of leaded glass panes visible behind the desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stylized depiction on a packaging without background elements like windows. World knowledge advises that product packaging typically focuses on the core item rather than elaborate backgrounds. Image A provides a detailed interior setting with the arched window clearly visible behind the desk.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design focuses solely on the stationery set and lacks peripheral elements like bookshelves. Common understanding of branding suggests focused imagery for simplicity and recognition. Image A includes an expansive view of the room, showcasing tall bookshelves to the left of the desk.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses dark brown and cream for its design elements. These are common in vintage themes seeking elegance, typical stationary set colors. While red/blue doesn't dominate, the palette is similar to dark brown and cream observed in Image A. Image A has deeper diversity in color with a touch of dark red from the rug and polished wood tones.",
