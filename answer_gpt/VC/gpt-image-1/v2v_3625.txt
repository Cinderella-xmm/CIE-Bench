    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the representation of a navigational tool (map)?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, although the map has been stylized to appear mosaic-like, it still retains the basic structure of a traditional map with colored regions and pathways that are indicative of landforms and routes. The presence of lines and varying colors typically associated with maps suggests that the representation of a navigational tool is maintained.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there identifiable markers (pins) indicating specific locations/routes on the map?",
    "explanation": "The edited image depicts four distinct colored pins (blue, yellow, green, and red) placed on various locations on the mosaic-like map. These pins are still clearly identifiable as they resemble actual pushpins, despite the artistic style applied to the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a visible hand interacting with the map, specifically placing a marker?",
    "explanation": "The image shows a hand stylized with a mosaic texture, reaching towards the map with one finger positioned near the red pin, suggesting interaction.

    "Question": "Q4: Are the markers (pins) visibly connected, suggesting a planned route?",
