      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the label contains a black bat icon with outstretched wings, placed within a red circular background, placed near the top of the label.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The word 'MOJITO' is indeed present on the label in Image B, positioned below the word 'BACARDÍ'.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle maintains a general shape that mimics the traditional Bacardí bottle with a curved body and a narrower neck. However, the Lego brick design slightly alters the smoothness of these curves, sacrificing some fluidity for the blocky appearance characteristic of Lego models.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cap in Image B is cylindrical, consistent with common bottle designs including the original Bacardí bottle. The Lego blocks add a pixelated style but maintain the fundamental cylindrical form typically present on bottle tops.",
