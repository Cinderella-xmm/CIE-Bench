    "Question": "Q1: Is the cactus still spherical in overall shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus maintains a generally spherical shape. The overall form is rounded with spikes protruding, which contributes to a sphere-like appearance. The visual cue of symmetry and the absence of elongated or distorted shapes suggest it remains spherical. Comparing this with Image A, where the cactus is also clearly spherical, affirms that the overall shape in Image B still retains its sphericity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the vertical ribs of the cactus clearly visible and maintaining their segmented pattern?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the rib structure is less pronounced compared to Image A. Image A shows distinct, well-defined vertical ribs. However, in Image B, the pattern is more ethereal and abstract due to the addition of eye motifs and other decorations. Rather than the segmented pattern seen in real cacti and in Image A, the design elements in Image B obscure the ribbing.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the main body of the cactus still predominantly green in color?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the main body of the cactus retains a green hue throughout. Despite the addition of eyes and decorative patterns, the dominant color of the cactus skin remains green, which matches the typical color of cacti seen in nature and the visual from Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the cactus positioned vertically and resting on a flat surface?",
    "explanation": "The cactus in Image B is positioned upright in a pot, suggesting a vertical orientation. The pot rests on a surface, conveying stability and an upright position. This arrangement mirrors Image A, where the cactus is also vertically placed and resting on a flat surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a textured, flat surface beneath the cactus container?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not clearly show a flat, textured surface beneath the cactus container. It is almost as if the pot is resting on a more ethereal, less defined background compared to the wooden-textured flat surface visible in Image A. The background in Image B appears more like smooth sand with minimal distinct texturing.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the cactus placed directly above a supporting structure (such as a pedestal or pot)?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus is placed in a pot which acts as a supporting structure. This is evident from the visibility of the pot's rim and the presence of a stable base, similar to the pot in Image A, which also holds the cactus.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the light source coming from the upper left, casting shadows toward the lower right?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the light source is depicted in the upper left, as highlighted by the bright sun. This results in shadows that are cast toward the lower right, which is consistent with the shadow direction. This lighting direction aligns with the visual portrayal in Image A, where shadows also fall in the same way, suggesting a consistent light source position.",
    "answer": "Yes"
