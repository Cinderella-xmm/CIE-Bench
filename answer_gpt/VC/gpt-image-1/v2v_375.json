      "question": "Is the brown horse with bridle and harness present in the same position and configuration as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no brown horse present. Instead, the image depicts a caricature of a wedding couple standing in front of a carriage. Using world knowledge, horses are typically depicted as large animals in relation to human figures and would be absent from an image focused primarily on human characters as seen in Image B. Comparatively, Image A prominently features a brown horse with a bridle and harness, underscoring its absence in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carriage is illustrated with red and ornamental designs but lacks the intricate details of gilded carvings and velvet curtains present in Image A. The design in Image B is simplified and stylized to fit a chibi art style. Image A’s feature of detailed golden carvings and velvet curtains caters to the realism of a classic painting, contrasting with the far less ornate depiction in Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no coachman depicted. The image features a caricature style with a focus on a wedding couple and does not include any representation of a coachman or reins. Image A includes a coachman in traditional attire seated on the driver's seat, clearly distinct from the edited depiction in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature any attendant or horse. The image is focused on the caricature figures of a wedding couple, and the attendant as seen in Image A is absent. Image A clearly presents an attendant in a dark blue coat and tricorn hat walking beside the horse, a detail missing from the chibi-style depiction in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes wheels as part of the carriage, but they are simplified to match the chibi art style, with less emphasis on details such as visible spokes. In Image A, the wooden wheels are prominently featured with clear detailing, which is absent in the caricature style representation in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a completely different background featuring red colors and decorative patterns typical for a wedding theme, diverging from the naturalistic trees and sky with clouds depicted in Image A. Image A’s background provides depth through its detailed rendering of nature, a detail that is absent from Image B’s stylized and themed rendering.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized depiction of the carriage lacks detailed gold leaf patterns and velvet textures found in Image A. The chibi style simplifies textures and patterns for a cartoonish appearance. Image A’s depiction includes intricate gold leaf patterns and rich velvet textures, differences that are evident in comparison.",
