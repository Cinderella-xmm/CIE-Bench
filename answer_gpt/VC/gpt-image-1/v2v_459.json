      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an object on the left with a distinct diagonal striped pattern showing vibrant colors of red, orange, turquoise, and blue. This pattern is consistent with a tie's diagonal striped design. The main difference is that the object seems to have a different form, resembling a toy or a figurine but still retains the striped pattern. Image A features a tie with the same diagonal striped pattern. Despite the transformation in shape, the pattern itself remains intact.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object on the right exhibits a blue body with white polka dots. This polka dot pattern is directly analogous to the pattern seen on the right tie in Image A, where the tie is blue with white dots. Despite any transformation in the overall form from a tie to another shape, the pattern itself remains unchanged.",

      "question": "Are the original colors (red, orange, turquoise, blue for the left tie and blue with white dots for the right tie) retained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left object shows a vibrant array of red, orange, turquoise, and blue colors in stripes, while the right object is predominantly blue with white dots. These colors directly match the colors on the ties in Image A: the left tie has the same colorful stripes and the right tie is blue with white dots. Thus, the original colors are preserved in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two objects representing the ties are positioned next to each other, with the striped pattern object on the left and the polka dot object on the right. In Image A, the ties are also placed with the striped tie on the left and the polka dot tie on the right. The relative positioning of the elements remains consistent between both images.",

      "question": "Is there a realistic surface texture in the background of the edited image, even if it is not the original wooden texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B has a wooden texture, detailed with carvings which seem to resemble wood grain or similar patterns. Although the edited image's background is different in design from Image A's plain wooden surface, it still mimics the style of realistic wood texture, achieving a similar realistic portrayal.",
