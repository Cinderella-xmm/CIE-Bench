      "question": "Is the \"PARKING\" label clearly visible on the parking meter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the label 'PARKING' at the top of the parking meter is prominently visible. The word is directly readable due to the existing light conditions, which provide adequate visibility without any obstruction or blurring. The metal housing that encases the label is intact and contributes to its visibility.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the sticker on the parking meter shows the text 'CostiArea'. While it maintains a similar visual style to what could be expected on such devices, it does not match 'ComsiAcara'. The visibility and clarity of the text on the sticker clearly reveal this discrepancy.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The parking meter in Image B is shown to be mounted securely on a pole, with no signs of leaning or disassembly. The meter's structure is upright, reflecting normal usage within urban settings. The base, connected with screws or bolts, seems to support the meter adequately in a stable vertical position.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parking meter appears to maintain standard proportions typical of such devices. It features known elements like the circular top, rectangular body, and mounting base, all in logical proportions and dimensions consistent with standard street installations.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, there is no visible shadow being cast underneath the parking meter on the ground. This could be due to angle, lighting, or editing aspects that prevent any direct shadow portrayal, indicating absence or subdued shadow elements.",
