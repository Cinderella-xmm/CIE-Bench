    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the vessel positioned in the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a decorative lamp placed on a patterned fabric. The lamp is positioned slightly right of the center, which is the main focus of the image. The position can be determined by observing its alignment with the visible areas surrounding it, revealing that it is not centered.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a circular tray directly beneath the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lamp sits directly on the patterned fabric, with no visible circular tray beneath it. This can be deduced from observing the base of the lamp and the immediate surrounding area, which shows no separate platform or tray support.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does vapor or smoke originate from the top opening of the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image depicts smoke or vapor that seemingly originates from the top of the lamp, creating a mystical or magical effect often associated with mythical stories. This is visually evident from the smoke trailing upwards from the lamp.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the vessel have a conical or upward-tapering shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vessel in Image B is an ornate lamp with a rounded body and a curved spout typical of a genie lamp, and not a conical shape. Conical shapes taper upwards to a point, which is not the case here.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the vessel placed on a flat, patterned fabric surface that covers the visible ground plane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lamp in the image is indeed placed on a flat, patterned fabric. The elaborately decorated surface covers the visible ground plane and appears smooth and even beneath the lamp.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a small opening at the top of the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lamp shows a presumably small opening at the top section from where the smoke or vapor is seen emanating. This is typical for such decorative lamps, often shown in stories releasing vapor or smoke from a top opening.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the tray made of a material visually similar to the vessel (e.g., terracotta)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lamp displayed in the image B does not have a tray beneath it, so this question is not applicable. However, the lamp itself appears to be metallic and ornamental, not terracotta.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Does the fabric beneath the vessel display a structured geometric pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fabric on which the lamp rests is covered by a detailed structure, showcasing a highly organized pattern involving ornate, repetitive floral designs consistent with a geometric layout.",
      "weight": 1,
