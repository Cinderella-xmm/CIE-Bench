      "question": "Is the wide, straight avenue leading directly toward the base of the Eiffel Tower preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower is creatively incorporated into a bottle design. There is no visible wide, straight avenue leading directly toward the base of the Eiffel Tower, as the primary focus is the artistic representation within the bottle. Since Image B replaces the avenue with a bottle design, the avenue present in Image A is not visible in the edited image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the symmetrical rows of green trees lining both sides of the avenue preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene has been transformed into a bottle with the Eiffel Tower depicted inside the bottle structure. The symmetrical rows of green trees that typically line an avenue leading to the Eiffel Tower, as seen in Image A, are not present in this altered format. The background mainly focuses on the bottle and its design.",

      "question": "Are the streetlights positioned along the sides of the avenue preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show the streetlights that might be positioned along an avenue. The focus in Image B is on the artistic representation of the Eiffel Tower within a bottle, and details such as streetlights, which are visible in Image A along the avenue, are not depicted.",

      "question": "Is the wet asphalt surface with visible reflections preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict any roadway or asphalt surface. Instead, it centers on the bottle design that houses the Eiffel Tower. Thus, the wet asphalt with its reflections, as seen in Image A, is not a feature of the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the overcast sky with dark, layered clouds preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a cloudy sky which is somewhat similar to the overcast skies in Image A, as seen through the transparent portions of the bottle. Therefore, the overcast sky with dark, layered clouds is preserved in the background context of the edited image.",
      "weight": 2,

      "question": "Is the distant Parisian skyline with identifiable rooftops and modern high-rises preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes the Eiffel Tower in a distinctive bottle design. While there appears to be a background that includes elements resembling distant structures and rooftops, they are not as prominent or detailed as in Image A, where the Parisian skyline is distinct. Therefore, while parts are faintly there, it does not preserve the same detailed skyline view.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses on the Eiffel Tower's representation within a bottle and does not include any depiction of vehicles, such as cars or buses, which are seen in Image A. The edited image completely omits these details in favor of its artistic focus.",
