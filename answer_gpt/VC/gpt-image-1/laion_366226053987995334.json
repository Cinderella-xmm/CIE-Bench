      "question": "Is the overall shape of each earring a symmetrical, elongated feather with pointed tips at both ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, it features cartoonish characters resembling feathers, with two sides but no pointed tips at both ends as they have arms and legs. The feather elements show stylistic elements like feathered patterns and comic features but don't adhere to the original earring shape of pointed tips at both ends. Therefore, the overall shape in Image B doesn't conform to a symmetrical, elongated feather with pointed tips at both ends compared to Image A.",

      "question": "Does each earring contain a centrally located oval black stone set within a metallic bezel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters modeled after the earrings appear to have central oval shapes that represent the oval black stones. These ovals appear centrally located, similar to the original earrings' design in Image A, with a surrounding border mimicking a metallic bezel. The representation aligns with the feature described.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there fine, parallel engraved lines extending outward from the central spine on both sides of the feather?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows cartoon-like feathers with stylized details that resemble engraved lines extending on either side, mimicking the original fine, parallel lines present in Image A's feather earrings. These lines are rendered in a way to humorously capture the detailed structure of a feather.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the metal of the earrings rendered in a silver tone with a matte or slightly oxidized (antiqued) finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration uses colors and details to imitate the original silver tone of the earrings, although rendered in a cartoon style. The tonal choices in the comic representation don't exactly display a metallic silver tone or matte finish since they utilize flat color ideal for comic art. Thus, it isn't consistent with the tangible silver tone with a matte finish evident in Image A.",

      "question": "Does each earring include a curved hook earwire connected via a small spherical bead to the main feather body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters do not showcase the upper part of an earring design such as a curved hook earwire or a small bead connecting to the main body, unlike Image A. The focus here is on the feather-like characters running with human-like arms and legs, omitting the structural attachment details of an earring.",

      "question": "Are the two earrings identical in shape, size, and orientation, mirrored across a vertical axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two animated feather characters are not mirrored; they are depicted as one following the other, introducing dynamic action rather than displaying a static mirrored symmetry, unlike Image A where the earrings are identical and symmetrically aligned.",
