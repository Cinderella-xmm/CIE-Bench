      "question": "Are the bright red flowers in the lower-left foreground still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower-left foreground is primarily occupied by green foliage with no visible bright red flowers. Image A clearly displays red flowers in this area. The absence of red in Image B suggests the flowers have been edited out, utilizing world knowledge that red is a highly distinctive color.",

      "question": "Is the large green leaf in the bottom-right corner still visible and in the same position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom-right corner features a large green leaf similar in placement to what is found in the same region of Image A. The leaf's positioning in the bottom-right of both images indicates it remains unchanged in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes palm-like fronds with fan-shaped leaves on the right side of the image. Comparing this to Image A reveals that the same palm fronds are present on the right side of the waterfall in both images, indicating no alteration to this feature.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, where the waterfall originates, there is no visible moss-covered rock formation like in Image A. Image A showcases rocks around the waterfall’s origin that appear moss-covered, unlike the altered point of origin seen in Image B, which suggests the absence of moss-covered rocks.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the presence of dense tropical vegetation encircling the scene, forming a natural frame that is consistent with Image A. Both images depict lush green foliage flanking the sides, confirming its continued presence.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pool area at the base of the waterfall is noticeably altered but retains the same general position as seen in Image A. Despite the visual changes, the pool's placement below the waterfall and the overall scene's structure confirm its consistent position across both images.",
