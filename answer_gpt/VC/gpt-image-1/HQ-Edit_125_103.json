    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a large pink peony flower prominently displayed on the body of the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no teapot displayed, so there is no possible observation of a pink peony flower on a teapot. The image features a cylindrical container and three small bowls, none of which have a peony flower depicted on them. Thus, based on the visual information, the answer is no.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a white clustered flower located next to the pink peony on the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains no visual representation of a teapot or flowers seen on it. Without the depiction of a teapot in this image, there is no context for identifying a white clustered flower next to a pink peony.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there green leaves and stems extending from the base of the flowers on the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visuals do not contain a teapot or any related details that might feature green leaves or stems. Instead, the image shows floral patterns on the cylindrical container and the bowls. However, these do not suggest leaves extending from flowers on a teapot.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the floral elements include pink, white, green, and orange-red berry-like accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral pattern in Image B is primarily gold on a beige or cream background, with no indication of pink, white, green, or orange-red colors or berry-like accents. The design stays consistent with a two-tone appearance.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is amber-colored tea visible in all four cups?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature any cups containing tea. It includes a cylindrical container and three covered bowls stacked on top of each other, none of which display tea.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the floral elements centrally located on the body of the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include a teapot, hence no central location can be observed for floral elements on a teapot. The container and bowls in the image have floral decorations, but not on a teapot.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the teapot surface exhibit a fine mesh or woven-texture appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A teapot is not present in Image B, and therefore, no surface texture such as mesh or woven patterns can be attributed to a teapot. The cylindrical container has a smooth surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there exactly four cups present in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays no cups. Instead, it shows one container and three matching covered bowls. None of these contain, or function as, cups. Therefore, four cups are not depicted in the scene.",
