      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the vertical cluster of lavender-like flowers with fuzzy purple petals present in the same structural arrangement as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers appear more stylized and are part of a fantasy scene with glowing elements, unlike the more realistic depiction in Image A. The structural arrangement is more whimsical and does not strictly follow the natural patterns seen in Image A. It involves a fictional character interacting with the flowers, suggesting a different setup and focus on artistic and magical representation rather than natural realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a single blue flower with a yellow center located at the top of the flower cluster?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a whimsical and artistic setting which does not seem to focus on individual flowers with distinct centers as seen in Image A. Instead, the emphasis is on the ethereal, glowing environment and a character interacting with the flowers, without a specific focus on a blue flower with a yellow center at the top of the cluster.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the butterfly positioned with its legs touching the flower stem, maintaining physical contact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a magical creature with butterfly-like features, but it is not physically interacting with a flower stem in the naturalistic sense seen in Image A. The creature is hovering near the flowers, suggesting a different focus on movement and flight rather than contact.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the wings of the butterfly fully spread in a side profile view, showing both left and right wings symmetrically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a fantastical creature rather than a realistic butterfly. Its wings are seen, but the emphasis is on glowing effects and magical elements, not on symmetrical wing display as seen in Image A, where a butterfly's wings are fully spread in a classical natural pose.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighting in the image coming from above, casting a warm golden glow over the butterfly and flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is consistent with a nighttime scene that is filled with ethereal, cool-toned illumination and glowing effects, not a warm golden glow. This contrasts with Image A, which does feature a warm glow suggestive of sunlight or a warm artificial light source. The scene in Image B is more mystical and filled with blue and violet hues.",
