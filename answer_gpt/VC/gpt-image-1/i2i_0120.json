        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Bulbasaur figurine is predominantly green. It features darker green markings on its body, which resemble diamond patterns. By analyzing visual cues, such as the coloration and the shapes on its body, as well as world knowledge of Bulbasaur's typical design, we can conclude this description fits. Thus, the Bulbasaur retains its characteristic body pattern in Image B.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the Bulbasaur figurine with vibrant red eyes, which are characteristic features of Bulbasaur's design.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Bulbasaur is depicted with a large bulb on its back.

      ],

      "question": "Are the claws on the Bulbasaur figurine's feet still shaped like small triangles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the claws on Bulbasaur's feet appear to be rounded rather than distinctly triangular. Comparison with world knowledge and typical representations of Bulbasaur suggests that the original triangular form of the claws is altered in this figurine. The departure from the triangular form is evident from the smooth, rounded depiction in the image.",
