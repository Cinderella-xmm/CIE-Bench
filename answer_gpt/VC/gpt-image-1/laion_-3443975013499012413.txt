    "Question": "Q1: Is the fish depicted in a continuous, coiled circular posture with its head pointing toward the upper right and tail curving beneath it?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the fish is represented as a standalone blue sculpture that forms a C-shape but not a continuous circle. The head points towards the upper right, but the tail is directed outwards and does not curve beneath to meet the head. Using common sense, a fully coiled circular form would mean the endpoint connects back to the starting point. Therefore, the fish does not complete a circular posture.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there three distinct barbels extending from the lower jaw of the fish?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible barbels extending from the fish's lower jaw. The fish is sculpted in a stylized, facet-cut appearance that focuses on form and texture rather than biological accuracy. Barbels are typically thin and would be visibly extending from the fish if present, but no such extensions are observed.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the dorsal fin located along the upper back of the fish and shaped with a serrated edge?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dorsal fin can be seen along the upper back of the fish. However, the dorsal fin is facet-cut, meaning it does not have a traditional serrated edge. This cut design gives a geometric impression rather than a naturalistic serrated edge.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the scales arranged in overlapping rows along the body of the fish, running from head to tail?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the surface texture reflects a faceted or crystallized-like appearance, rather than typical overlapping fish scales. Scales would be normally be small, individual, overlapping units covering the entire body in orderly rows, but this design focuses on geometric facets instead.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the tail of the fish curve underneath the body and connect near the head, completing a nearly full circle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tail of the fish can be observed curving outward rather than curving underneath to complete a circular shape. The fish is shaped like a C, meaning there's a notable gap between head and tail which prevents a closure into a full circle.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there two pectoral fins visible on the side of the fish, one near the head and one further back?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, one pectoral fin is discernible near the head of the fish. Nevertheless, no second pectoral fin further back is visible within this sculpture, resulting in the conclusion that only a single pectoral fin is present on this design.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the fish carving contained within a square-shaped panel with rounded corners?",
    "explanation": "Although Image B features a fish sculpture, it is freestanding and not integrated into any type of panel, such as one that is square-shaped with rounded corners. Instead, the fish sits alone, highlighting its three-dimensional aspect.",
    "answer": "No"
