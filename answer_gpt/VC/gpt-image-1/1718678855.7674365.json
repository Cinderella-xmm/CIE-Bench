      "question": "Is the capybara’s snout broad and flat with a rounded muzzle, consistent with its real-world anatomy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a capybara. Visually, the capybara’s snout is displayed as broad and flat with a rounded muzzle, closely matching the typical anatomical features of a real-world capybara. Its snout is depicted in a way that is both broad and rounded, fitting the expected characteristics for this animal.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the capybara’s ears small, rounded, and located high on the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the capybara’s ears are depicted as small and rounded, positioned high on the animal’s head. This is consistent with the real-world anatomy of capybaras, which have small, round ears set relatively high on their heads.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the capybara standing upright and facing directly toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The capybara in the edited image is depicted as facing the viewer directly, but it is not standing upright as in a human-like posture. Instead, the capybara is shown from a frontal angle but in a more natural stance. Capybaras typically do not stand upright like humans; they have a horizontal posture even when they appear to be facing forward in images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both hands positioned in front of the chest, gripping an object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the capybara is depicted with its hands positioned in front of its chest, holding a teacup. This positioning suggests a human-like gesture where the hands are brought together to grip an object, which is consistent with the description provided.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the capybara’s fur primarily light brown with darker tones around the muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The capybara in the edited image exhibits fur that is primarily light brown, and there are indeed darker tones noticeable around the muzzle area. This color distribution is typical of real-world capybaras, which often have a light brown coat with variations in shading.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the capybara have a stocky, large body with short legs and a thick torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the capybara is dressed in human clothing, which makes it difficult to fully judge the body shape. However, the visible parts suggest a proportionate depiction: capybaras naturally have a stocky and robust build with a thick torso. However, the edited image focuses more on the capybara’s upper body and does not depict legs clearly.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the capybara have four limbs visible or implied by posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image only provides a view of the capybara’s upper body, which implies the presence of limbs necessary for holding the teacup. However, only the front limbs are visible, with the posterior limbs not clearly depicted or implied due to the angle and clothing.",
