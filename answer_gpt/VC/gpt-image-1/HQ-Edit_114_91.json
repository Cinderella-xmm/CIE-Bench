      "question": "Is the anvil’s pointed horn still present and positioned at the same end of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'anvil' has been transformed into a mystical tree-like owl figure, but it maintains the structural form of an anvil, including the pointed horn. Therefore, the pointed horn is present and located at the same end as in traditional anvils.",

      "question": "Does the hammer retain a wooden handle connected to its head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no hammer visible with a wooden handle connected to a head, as seen in traditional tools. The transformation has resulted in the absence of the hammer.",

      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no hammer present resting diagonally across the 'anvil', which has been transformed into an owl-like figure. The absence of a traditional hammer eliminates this possibility.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the window with multiple panes and frosted glass is visible on the left side, similar to Image A. This design element remains consistent in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, similar to Image A, there are still multiple tools visible mounted vertically on the wooden wall behind the area where the 'anvil' now transformed sits. This arrangement is unchanged in terms of positioning.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are green ivy leaves visible growing over the window frame and wrapping around the base of the anvil and hammer handle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, green ivy leaves are growing over the window frame and around the newly reimagined figure resembling an anvil. However, there is no hammer handle present. The transformation focuses more on integrating natural elements around an owl figure.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the anvil sitting on a wooden workbench showing signs of wear and dust accumulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface appears well integrated with the owl-like figure and does not show signs of typical wear and dust common on a simple workbench. The focus is more on the transformation and integration with nature rather than wear and dust.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an emphasis on nature with the owl figure resembling a tree, which incorporates the thematic presence of roots. There are no visible signs of organic debris scattered on the workbench as seen in typical disordered settings.",
