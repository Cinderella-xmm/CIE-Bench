    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the black stripes evenly distributed across the body, head, and legs in the same pattern as the original knitted animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays black stripes forming a square mosaic pattern across the animal's body, head, and legs instead of the knitted linear stripes in Image A. The stripes in Image B bear a tiled appearance rather than a knitted flow seen in Image A. Image B shows uniform distribution in a mosaic form, differing from the knitted pattern of Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the snout present with two clearly defined, dark circular nostrils positioned symmetrically on the upper portion of the snout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, there are no distinct, circular nostrils outlined on the snout, but rather a continuous mosaic pattern. In Image A, the snout displays two dark stitches that resemble nostrils, which are absent in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the eyes large, round, and positioned symmetrically on the face, each consisting of a white outer ring and a central black pupil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features eyes with a large, round shape, placed symmetrically on the face. They consist of a white outer ring with a central black pupil, which is consistent with the knitted animal in Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the mouth a clearly visible curved line forming a smile below the snout, consistent with the original animalâ€™s expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mouth is represented by a mosaic pattern without a distinct curved line depicting a smile, unlike the clear stitched smile visible in Image A's knitted animal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the animal in a walking pose with the left front leg extended forward and the right front leg grounded behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the animal with none of its legs extended in a particular walking pose; instead, all four legs are grounded, contrasting with Image A where one leg is visibly extended forward in a walking stance.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there two small, rounded ears positioned symmetrically on top of the head, pointing slightly outward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animal has two small rounded ears symmetrically positioned on top of its head and pointing outward, similar to the design seen in Image A's knitted animal, showing consistency in ear placement and shape.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the sculpture placed on a surface with a visibly granular, uneven texture resembling natural sand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the sculpture placed on a textured base, but it does not possess the granular, uneven texture indicative of natural sand found in the background of Image A.",
