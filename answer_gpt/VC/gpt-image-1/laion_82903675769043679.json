    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the curved contour of the fairway, leading from the foreground toward the green, preserved in its original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fairway is depicted using geometric shapes in various shades of green, creating a sense of depth and contour that suggests a curved shape. This stylized representation maintains the overall trajectory of a fairway leading toward a green. A comparison with Image A shows the fairway originally had a curved contour. Despite its transformation into abstract geometric shapes in Image B, the contour's essence is preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sand bunkers located in their original positions along the fairway, particularly near the green and on the left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sand bunkers are represented as pale yellow geometric shapes, located in areas that suggest their positions near the green, similar to how they appear in Image A. The abstract portrayal of the fairway in Image B maintains the positioning of the sand bunkers compared to Image A.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the water hazard present in the foreground, directly bordering the fairway, and reflecting the sky and structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses geometric shapes and vibrant colors to depict what appears to be the water hazard in the foreground, characterized by its reflective properties. These colors mirror those found in structures and sky segments, maintaining the reflective aspect seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the AT&T GOLF tower and the white event tents located in the right midground, adjacent to the spectator area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses abstract geometric shapes to create the impression of structures in the right midground. It seems to represent event tents using alternating patterns and squares, adjacent to what appears to be a crowd of spectators. The overall arrangement mirrors the positioning of the event tents and crowds noted in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the green area elevated at the back, forming a slight incline from the fairway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses varying shades of green and blue geometric shapes to convey depth and dimension at the back of the green area, suggesting an elevation. The comparison with Image A shows that the green was elevated, forming a slight incline. This elevation, while represented abstractly in Image B, maintains the original perspective from Image A.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a dense group of spectators visible along the edge of the fairway, especially near the green?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a crowd using varied, colorful shapes along what is clearly the edge of the fairway nearing the green area. The abstract representation effectively captures the density and positioning of spectators similar to those seen in Image A.",
