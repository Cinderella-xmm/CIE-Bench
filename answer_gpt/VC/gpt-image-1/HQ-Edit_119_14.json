      "question": "Is the full white beard present on the figureâ€™s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face has been blurred, thus making it impossible to determine whether a white beard is present. Based on this observation, the answer is 'No' because the blur obscures these details.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a red or dark tilak mark positioned between the eyebrows on the forehead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the blurred area on the face in Image B, it is impossible to discern any details such as a tilak mark between the eyebrows. Thus, there is no visible tilak mark that can be identified.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the figure displaying an open-mouthed smile showing teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurred portion of the image prevents any clear view of facial features such as a smile or teeth. Therefore, the answer is 'No' because the blur hides these details.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the man's posture can be analyzed based on the visible section of the body. The arms are visibly positioned along the sides, relaxed and not prominently holding anything or posing in a tension-filled manner, indicating a typical upright stance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a partial view of the figure - missing details below the waist and above the head due to the blurring effect on the face. However, there is a sufficiently central portion of the torso visible in the frame.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurred area of the face in Image B obscures facial details including skin tone and texture, making it impossible to judge the preservation of these attributes.",
