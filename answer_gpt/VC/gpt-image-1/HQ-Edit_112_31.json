      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features stylized, simplified tree figures, resembling coniferous trees. However, due to the stylized nature of the image, they are not depicted as a realistic forest but instead provide a suggestive background environment.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the environment is a stylized scene with minimal depth, not realistic. The felt dandelions are arranged around the horse figure, suggesting it stands among them, though they do not interact dimensionally with the horse's legs realistically as they would in a photograph.",
