    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there at least one clock face with Roman numerals visible on the front or side of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a fantastical, mechanical character, inspired by a clock's design, but it lacks any traditional clock faces with Roman numerals on the front or side of the structure. Instead, it features a large eye where you might expect a clock face to be.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there transparent glass panels on the lower section of the clock showing internal mechanical components such as pendulums and weights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B represents a steampunk-style robot that incorporates gears and other mechanical elements, and while there's an orb underneath that could resemble a pendulum, there's no indication of transparent glass panels showcasing these components as in a traditional pendulum clock.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the base of the structure contain decorative relief carvings featuring circular medallions and floral motifs arranged symmetrically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, illustrating a mechanical creature, does feature ornate details and gears, particularly around its body and limbs, but these are different from traditional relief carvings with circular medallions or floral motifs found in a clock base.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a sharpened wooden pencil standing vertically to the right of the clock, with its graphite tip pointing upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no pencil visible in the composition. The image exclusively focuses on a mechanical, robotic figure designed like a steampunk clockwork machine without any additional objects such as a pencil.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background composed of a light-colored surface with a visible grid pattern of evenly spaced horizontal and vertical lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a steampunk robot in a setting that resembles a monochromatic drawing, but the background lacks any grid pattern of horizontal and vertical lines; it appears as a plain, consistent light color rather than a pattern.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the structure maintain a tall, rectangular, multi-tiered form with symmetrical columns and a defined top cap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B consists of a complicated, steampunk-inspired robot that deviates from traditional clock structures. This design is more akin to a fantastical character rather than a tall, rectangular form with columns and a cap, differing significantly from typical clock architecture.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
