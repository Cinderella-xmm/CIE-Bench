      "question": "Are the shrimp rendered in a pink-orange color consistent with cooked shrimp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see cartoonish shrimp. Despite their animated appearance, they share color cues with cooked shrimp, showing a pink-orange hue that is typical of shrimp once they are cooked. This coloring represents a clear understanding that shrimp obtain this hue upon being cooked, translating it into the comic style. Drawing from the generally recognized appearance of cooked shrimp helps facilitate recognition and coherence in color choice, even in animations.",

      "question": "Is there visible red spice coating on the shrimp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, being a cartoon version, depicts shrimp in an exaggerated caricature form. While the shrimp show a reddish-orange hue and are talking about achieving spicy success, there is no specific depiction or illustration of red spice powders coating them, like paprika or chili. The communicative cues indicate an intention for flavor, but visual precision in spice depiction as seen in real-life scenarios is absent in this animated style.",

      "question": "Are there yellow lemon wedges with visible rind and pulp in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a cartoon shrimp holding a lemon wedge. The lemon wedge in the cartoon is yellow with a visible rind and inner pulp, which are typical features that authenticate it as a lemon wedge. The vibrant color and details like the pulp are simplified but effectively conveyed by the cartoon representation, maintaining accuracy in terms of common knowledge of lemon characteristics.",

      "question": "Are there finely chopped green herbs visible on and around the shrimp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoon in Image B shows a scene where green herbs are visible, but they are presented as individual large leaves floating around the shrimp character, not finely chopped herbs. This stylistic choice in cartoons often aims to emphasize the idea or action rather than the exact appearance in real life. This intentional deviation from reality serves to bolster the narrative context rather than realistically replicate the appearance and abundance of finely chopped herbs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shrimp maintain a curled, C-shaped form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shrimp character exhibits a more upright and stretched posture due to its anthropomorphic, animated nature, although there is an indication of a slight curve due to bent arms and a tail. In the context of cartoon representation, the shrimp does not strictly adhere to the C-shaped form typically seen in cooked shrimp because the goal is to provide dynamism and character expression instead of precise anatomical realism.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the stainless steel pan with rivets present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B is a cartoon strip that does not include or depict any stainless steel pans or cooking equipment in the literal sense. The setting is a kitchen environment where the shrimp character is holding a lemon, and some kitchen items like pepper grinders are present, but there is no stainless steel pan with rivets. The absence of such items is typical in animated storytelling where focus is placed more on character interaction than environmental detailing.",
