      "question": "Are the cheetahs still depicted in their original seated and standing postures on the earthen mound?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetahs are depicted with a steampunk aesthetic, giving them an artificial appearance, but their postures remain the same as in Image A. One cheetah is seated, and the other is standing, similar to the original photograph. The visual posturing of the figures confirms this, despite the stylistic changes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetahs are shown on a mound, similar to Image A. The mound's texture and color have changed slightly to match the steampunk theme, but the base structure is still recognizable as the original earthen mound in Image A.",

      "question": "Do the cheetahs retain their black-ringed tails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the cheetahs have a steampunk aesthetic, and their tails are depicted in this style. The original smooth texture and coloration of the tails are altered, but the pattern of black rings from Image A is integrated into the steampunk depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background has been transformed to match a steampunk theme, with mechanical structures and a different color tone. The original savanna landscape with its greenery and natural horizon line in Image A is replaced by this industrial setting, indicating a significant change.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The relative positioning of the cheetahs in Image B remains consistent with that in Image A, with one cheetah seated in front and the other standing behind. This is evident from the positioning and posture in both images.",
