      "question": "Is the crown-like forehead design with three dots and a central triangle present on the child's forehead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible portions are primarily focused on the clothing and accessories, such as the ornate garment and necklace. The image is styled to appear as a classic portrait with no evidence or indication of any additional decorative patterns or modern embellishments on the forehead, such as a crown-like design. The styling remains consistent with traditional portrait artistry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the lace-like borders encircling the eyes clearly visible and symmetrically drawn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses on period attire and traditional adornments. There is no visible evidence of lace-like designs or embellishments around the eyes since the facial details are entirely blurred, and any such designs would not conform to the historic styling evident in the rest of the image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the mouth depicted with a stitched, jagged-tooth pattern and vertical lines extending from the nose to the chin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From the visible portions of Image B, attention is drawn to period clothing details rather than facial features, and these style elements conform to traditional portraiture. There's no indication of stylistic or artistic elements such as a stitched pattern on the mouth; facial features are blurred and not detailed.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the eyes positioned symmetrically and maintain their original almond shape and direct forward gaze?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features such as the eyes are not visible due to the blur effect. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that the eyes are symmetrical or almond-shaped solely based on the visible portions of the image, which emphasize traditional garment design rather than facial characteristics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the makeup pattern symmetrically aligned across the left and right sides of the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, any makeup patterns or facial details are obscured by blur, leaving only the surrounding elements of traditional clothing and accessories visible. Consequently, it's not possible to determine or assess the alignment of makeup patterns on the face.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial region, including the nose bridge, is obscured in Image B, with only attire and accessories being clearly visible. Therefore, no definitive assessment can be made regarding the definition or positioning of facial features based solely on the visible portions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the natural lip contours visible beneath the painted teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features, including lips, are blurred, making it impossible to discern any detailed features or implementations such as painted teeth or natural lip contours. The focus remains on the traditional garment details rather than facial features.",
