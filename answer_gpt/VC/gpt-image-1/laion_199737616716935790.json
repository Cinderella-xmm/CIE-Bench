    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the skull face with grinning teeth and hollow eyes located on the rear fender of the motorcycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rear fender does not feature any visible skull with grinning teeth and hollow eyes. Instead, this skull design is found on the side panel towards the middle of the motorcycle. Using general knowledge, a rear fender is located above the rear wheel and would usually display designs or decals in the context of custom designs. The examined visual information indicates that the skull is not on the rear fender but rather on a different part of the motorcycle.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a skull face with grinning teeth and hollow eyes positioned on the front headlight cowl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a skull face with grinning teeth and hollow eyes located on the front part of the motorcycle, which visually aligns with where the headlight cowl would typically be. The headlight cowl is an area directly above the front headlight, often used for displaying logos or decals.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the blue angular stripes present along the fuel tank, side panels, and front fairing in the same geometric configuration as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, blue angular stripes are visible on parts of the motorcycle. However, when compared to Image A, the positions and geometric configurations of these stripes appear slightly simplified due to the medium as a LEGO model. Hence, these markings do not completely match the precise geometric configuration as seen in the original image.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the “V-SDI” and “VFORCE3” decal visible on the lower side panel near the foot peg area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the decals visible do not include “V-SDI” and “VFORCE3,” which would be expected in the location near the foot peg area based on their branding format in Image A. The stickers in Image B are different and do not visibly include these particular decals.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the motorcycle shown in a side profile view facing toward the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle is displayed in a clear side profile view with the front of the vehicle facing toward the right side of the image. This orientation allows for the full view of the motorcycle's right-hand side, confirming its right-facing direction.",

      "question": "Is the exhaust pipe located beneath the seat and curving downward toward the rear wheel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible exhaust pipe curving downward toward the rear wheel beneath the seat. LEGO models often simplify or omit small details for stylistic purposes. This simplified construct does not include an exhaust pipe feature as described in the question.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the seat have a smooth, slightly curved surface with a raised backrest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seat appears to be constructed with LEGO bricks, resulting in a less definitive shape and absence of smooth curvature and raised backrest that is typically noted in an actual motorcycle seat like in Image A. The blocky nature of LEGO implies a more angular surface without distinct curvature or backrest.",
