    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the number \"1902\" clearly visible on the front of the locomotive?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no numbers visible on the front of the locomotive. Image B is designed to appear as a puzzle piece representation rather than a detailed rendition of objects. Hence, the specific numerical detail seen in Image A is absent.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the locomotive retain a dominant green color on its body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the locomotive maintains a cartoonish depiction where vibrant and simplified colors are used. The locomotive is predominantly green, which aligns with the design choice despite the simplification in artistic style compared to Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the station building constructed from stone material with visible texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the station building is depicted as a flat, puzzle-like piece with colored squares representing bricks. This simplified form does not convey the texture of stone material as seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there moss growing on the roof of the station building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, details such as moss on the roof are absent due to the simplified, cartoonish design akin to puzzle pieces, which abstracts small details into basic geometric forms.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there luggage trunks present on the platform near the passengers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible luggage trunks. The figures and objects are depicted in a simplified manner, focusing on the essentials necessary for the puzzle design rather than detailed aspects like luggage.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are wind turbines visible on the hilltop in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, wind turbines are indeed visible on the hilltop. These are simplified yet recognizable within the context of the puzzle format, maintaining the essential elements portrayed in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the railway track visibly curved as it extends into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the railway track appears straight rather than curved. The artistic simplification involves straight lines and geometric forms typical of puzzle design, contrasting with the curvature seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seating arrangements are abstracted to basic forms. There isn't a clear indication that benches are wooden; they are depicted as simple shapes in the puzzle design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Do the figures on the platform wear clothing consistent with early 20th-century fashion (e.g., top hats, long dresses)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the figures are simplified into puzzle shapes, they retain elements suggestive of early 20th-century fashion, like hats and attire stylized to imply historical clothing, aligning with representations seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
