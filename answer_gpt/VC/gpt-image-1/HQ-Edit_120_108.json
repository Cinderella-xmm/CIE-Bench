        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a book located on the desk that appears open, showcasing intricate designs resembling mechanical gears along its pages.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays an ornate desk lamp crafted from brass positioned on the left side of the desk. Its design includes artful embellishments typical of brass objects, and its arm is extended, directing the light toward the open book. The positioning is consistent with it being on the left side with light focused inward.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the desk is illustrated with the appearance that resembles wood but lacks distinct grain texture as it's stylized with a steampunk aesthetic, emphasizing warm browns and metallic tones. The desk serves as the base surface for objects like the lamp and books; however, the details are more schematic rather than true wood texture.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two books are visible stacked neatly on the right side of the desk, with a small closed book discernible on the left side. This arrangement matches the conventional placement of multiple objects depicted with clarity in this steampunk-themed illustration.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the lamp emitting a narrow, focused beam directly onto the open book, illuminating the mechanical designs within. The light's source and its direct fall onto the book are evident, providing clear visual guidance toward the illuminated objects. This focused lighting suggests intentional directionality toward the book.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B conveys an overall aesthetic characterized by warm browns and rich golden tones prominent in the lamp and desk. The wall features darker shades akin to deep blues, all contributing to the vintage steampunk aesthetic reminiscent of leather-and-brass stylings, typically seen in such decorative themes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background wall in Image B is illustrated with a dark tone that appears more industrial with gear patterns and rivet-like structures more than teal, fitting the steampunk motif. While textured in design, the color doesn't strictly align with teal, and emphasizes metallic and darker colors typical of steampunk setups, blending with interiors more common in such genres.",
