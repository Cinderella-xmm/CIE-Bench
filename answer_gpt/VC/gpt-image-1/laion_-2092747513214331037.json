      "question": "Is the cyclist in a forward-leaning position with hands on aerobars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cyclist is depicted in a streamlined, forward-leaning position, which is typical for time trial cyclists aiming to minimize wind resistance. The hands appear to be positioned on the aerobars, as indicated by the grip and stance, which is consistent with the common practice in competitive cycling to enhance aerodynamics.",

      "question": "Are two bicycles mounted vertically on the roof rack of the black car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visual depiction of a single bicycle mounted on the roof rack of the car, not two. This can be observed through the clear outline and shape of only one bicycle on the car's roof.",

      "question": "Are there white lane markings and a yellow center line on the road?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the road surface does not show any lane markings or center lines, as it is stylized and not detailed in a realistic manner like Image A. Instead, the image focuses on a blue glowing effect to create an artistic impression of motion.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the style of the depiction does not include realistic road elements such as traffic cones, which contrasts with the more realistic setting of Image A. Image B emphasizes a stylized representation absent of such details.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car design is artistic and stylized, focusing on a futuristic aesthetic without the inclusion of specific details such as a readable license plate. The illustration prioritizes the theme of speed and technology over minute realistic details.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene depicted is more artistic than realistic, focusing on both the car and the cyclist in a parallel frame within a digital landscape that implies movement and speed. Despite a lack of an explicit road, the composition suggests parallels similar to Image A's depiction of the cyclist and car on the same road.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is stylized and abstract, emphasized by the futuristic and digital theme throughout the image. This contrasts with Image A, which shows more natural and realistic scenery like dry hills with sparse vegetation. Image B omits such environmental details in favor of a thematic representation.",
