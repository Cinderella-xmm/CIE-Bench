      "question": "Are there two separate, cushioned backrest sections positioned side by side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is an imaginative depiction of a sofa where the backrest area is shaped like clouds with eyes, giving an impression of two joined sections rather than distinctly separate cushions. Rather than traditional cushions, it uses a creative, artistic cloud-like form which suggests an unusual design. The common idea behind artistic or conceptual illustrations like this is to integrate elements, making it slightly different from standard descriptions of cushioned backrest sections considered separately in functional furniture design. However, since the elements in the back are perceived as two clouds joined while retaining some individuality, we count them as two sections.",

      "question": "Are there two armrests, one on each side of the sofa, aligned with the seat cushions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a fantastical sofa design where the armrests take on a cloudy form, curled up like tendrils. These artistic arms exist on either side of the seating area, similar to conventional armrests on a sofa. Whereas typical sofas have defined armrests aligned with the lateral ends of the seat cushions, this creative rendition, while abstract, still portrays armrest-like formations aligned with what can be assumed is the seat space. Thus, world knowledge about creative illustrations supports seeing them as armrests.",

      "question": "Does the sofa have four legs, one at each corner of the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In this artistic cloud illustration from Image B, the sofa representation has no traditional base or legs; instead, it features tendril-like extensions that mimic the appearance of cloud formations extending from beneath. These extensions do not resemble solid sofa legs found in traditional sofa designs positioned at corners to support the sofa. Such imaginative artwork does not conform to the structural conventions of a physical sofa. Hence, it doesn't exhibit four legs positioned at each corner.",

      "question": "Is the sofa symmetrically arranged along a vertical centerline, with identical features on the left and right sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an abstract sofa with a cloud-like design, where visual symmetry is achieved in the depiction. Each side of the sofa is a mirror of the other, with characteristic cloud bodies and eye pairs, evoking a symmetric balance along a central axis. Symmetry is common in both artistic depictions and furniture design, giving a balanced visual experience. Thus, the arrangement in Image B aligns with these symmetry standards.",

      "question": "Are the seat cushions positioned directly beneath the backrest cushions, forming a continuous seating surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creative composition features no traditional seat or backrest cushions as seen in conventional sofas. Instead, clouds mimic these elements, presenting a smooth, flowing design as part of the artistic expression. While it lacks defined separation seen in functional designs, for artistic interpretations, the area presented aligns to show a seamless connection between indicative seat and back areas through imaginative cloud forms. However, this does not form a continuous seating surface in the traditional understanding of furniture.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there small black circular fasteners visible on the wooden frame, particularly near the armrest joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays an illustrative, soft cloud-like sofa interpretation with no actual wood or frame elements visible. It foregoes traditional construction details such as fasteners for an entirely conceptual and fluid design. In conventional settings, small circular fasteners might be key for structural stability, but in a purely conceptual artistic piece like this, they are nonexistent, highlighting a departure from practical furniture design into imaginative representation.",
