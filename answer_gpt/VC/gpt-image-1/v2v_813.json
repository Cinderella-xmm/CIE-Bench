      "question": "Is the dark, glossy texture of the chocolate sauce preserved in the sneaker design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sneaker exhibits a dark and glossy finish on certain sections that resemble the texture of chocolate sauce. This conclusion is drawn from observing the shiny surface and rich color that are characteristic of the sauce depicted on the cake in Image A.",

      "question": "Are the flowing, pooling patterns of the chocolate sauce represented in the sneaker’s form or material application?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sneaker's design in Image B shows a wavy and flowing form which mimics the pattern of melted and pooled chocolate sauce seen in Image A. This is evident from the overlapping curvy lines on the sneaker that imitate how chocolate sauce drapes over surfaces.",

      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a sneaker design that incorporates ruffled and organic contours reminiscent of the irregular, wavy edges of lettuce seen in Image A. The green areas of the sneaker exhibit undulating designs that are clearly inspired by the organic, natural shape of lettuce.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sneaker in Image B possesses a significant portion of glossy material that reflects light similarly to the chocolate sauce in Image A. This reflective quality gives an impression of a shiny, mirrored surface which is characteristic of chocolate sauce.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sneaker design demonstrates a distinct contrast between the dark chocolate-like areas and green lettuce-like sections. This is visible in the clashing colors and textures, creating a visual distinction similar to that seen between the chocolate cake and lettuce in Image A.",
