      "question": "Is the horse depicted with a dark mane running along its neck and a long, dark tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is prominently depicted with a muscular build and a noticeably dark mane that runs along its neck. The tail is also long and dark, consistent with typical horse depictions. These features are visually apparent and are characteristic of many horse breeds, where a dark mane contrasts with a brown or chestnut body. Therefore, based on these visual cues, the answer is 'Yes'.",

      "question": "Does the elephant have two visible, curved white tusks extending from its mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is seen with two tusks extending from its mouth. However, these tusks are not white; they match the overall color of the elephant, which is a muted, earthy tone, and are also not prominently highlighted as white. This indicates a different visual cue for tusks than the typical depiction of bright white. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.",

      "question": "Is there a flat wooden platform positioned between the horse and the elephant, supporting the horse and resting on the elephant’s back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a flat wooden platform is distinctly visible, positioned between the horse and the elephant. This platform features enough detail in its depiction to suggest it serves as a support for the horse while resting on the elephant's back. This is evident from the defined separation between the two animals. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.",

      "question": "Are both the horse and the elephant depicted in profile view, facing toward the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the horse and the elephant are depicted in a profile view. The horse is oriented such that its facial profile and musculature are visible facing the left side of the image. Similarly, the elephant is also facing left, with its trunk and ear suggesting a leftward orientation. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.",

      "question": "Does the elephant have a long, segmented trunk that curls upward at the tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's trunk appears to be long and visually segmented with defined contours and shading. The tip of the trunk curls slightly upward, consistent with the question's description. This natural position of an elephant's trunk is captured well in the image. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.",

      "question": "Is the background a uniform beige color with a subtle paper-like texture and no additional scenery or objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is not a uniform beige color but rather a dark, textured backdrop, which resembles a painting style. It lacks the subtle paper-like texture described and instead presents a more dramatic and chiaroscuro effect with shadows. This deviates from the uniform and minimalistic description. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.",

      "question": "Is the horse’s body primarily a rich brown color with black lower legs, mane, and tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is depicted with a body that is indeed a rich brown color, which is emphasized by the dark rendering of musculature. Its mane and tail are dark, providing a stark contrast to the body color. However, the lower legs appear to blend with the brown body rather than being distinctly black. Despite this, the general description is accurate. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.",
