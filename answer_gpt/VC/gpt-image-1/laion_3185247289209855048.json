        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not provide specific color information regarding the eyes, as faces are blurred or obscured in the keychain designs. Without visible eyes, it's not possible to determine or speculate on their color.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image of the keychain designs, the faces and specifically the lips are not detailed or visible due to the blurred face regions. Thus, it is not possible to observe or discuss the lipstick color.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the keychain designs, the depiction does not include specific directional gazes or eye positions due to the minimalistic representation and blurred face. The characters appear to be facing forward in a profile or sideways position, rather than looking in a particular direction.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the keychain designs, the profile representations of individuals include bare necks and shoulders as a stylized depiction, consistent across the designs. This presentation matches the bare visibility of shoulders.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image of the keychains, the central character has a pinkish hair or decorative element that provides a textured appearance, matching the description of a pink, textured material visible in the lower edge vicinity.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no indication of directional lighting affecting the cheekbones or jawline in the keychain designs, as these elements are simplistically rendered and mainly defined by outlines without detailed shading or highlights.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the keychain designs, facial features are minimized and obscured with a blurred area, leaving no observable elements like eyes, nose, or mouth. Thus, no conclusions about symmetry or feature spacing can be drawn.",
