      "question": "Is the painting still depicting orange-yellow trees along a river under a setting sun?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall behind the sofa is now fully covered with a mural depicting orange-yellow trees lining a river under a setting sun. This maintains a similar scene to Image A, which had a framed painting of the same visual elements on the wall. Therefore, the essence of the original depiction is preserved in a larger format on the wall.",

      "question": "Does the sofa still have beige cushions with a yellow accent pillow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sofa retains its beige color, and the arrangement includes similarly toned cushions as in Image A. There is also a yellow accent pillow among these, which matches the setup in the original photo. Thus, the couch cushions and the accented yellow cushion have been maintained.",

      "question": "Is the sofa still positioned directly below the wall painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the wall has changed from having a framed painting to being a full mural, the sofa remains directly positioned against this mural, similarly to how it was below the framed painting in Image A. Although the presentation of the artwork has changed from a painting to a mural, the sofa's alignment with the visual art remains unchanged.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, natural light is visible, casting shadows from the right side of the scene, indicating a continuation from Image A where windows or a light source on the right similarly lit the room. This maintains the same lighting conditions as initially observed.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flooring appears to be a consistent light-colored herringbone pattern, as seen similarly in Image A. The texture and pattern of the floor remain unchanged, confirming that the floor's visual style has not been altered.",
