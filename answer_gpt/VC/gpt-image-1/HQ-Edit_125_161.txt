    "Question": "Q1: Is the herringbone-patterned wooden floor present and accurately rendered in the same layout and orientation as in the original image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the floor is obscured by the presence of a large dragon sculpture wrapping around the staircase and does not feature a discernible herringbone-patterned wooden floor as seen in Image A. The layout and orientation of the flooring design cannot be confirmed. Therefore, the distinct herringbone pattern is not visible in the edited image.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the vertical and horizontal moldings of the wall paneling preserved, including the recessed rectangular panels and crown molding?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wall paneling, including vertical and horizontal moldings and recessed rectangular panels, appears to be preserved. These elements are visible on the left and right sides of the image, showcasing the same architectural detailing observed in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the oval-shaped skylight or oculus at the top of the spiral staircase still present and positioned centrally above the coil?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a portion at the top of the spiral staircase that suggests the presence of an oval-shaped skylight or oculus. However, due to the altered content where a dragon sculpture occupies space, the skylight's full appearance and central positioning are less discernible, and its exact alignment cannot be clearly assessed.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the graphite pencil visible in the lower-right corner of the image, angled diagonally across the drawingâ€™s border?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible graphite pencil in the lower-right corner as was present in Image A. The focus is on the dragon sculpture and the staircase, without showing drawing tools or borders.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the thin ruled border enclosing the entire drawing present, with short perpendicular lines at each corner?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not display a ruled border enclosing the drawing or any short perpendicular lines at the corners, which were present in Image A. The dragon sculpture and the wall dominate the image, leaving no room for such outlining.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the perspective of the scene maintain convergence toward the oval skylight at the top, with all architectural lines aligning accordingly?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, although the altered scene includes a dragon sculpture intertwined with the staircase, the architectural lines of the staircase and walls suggest a similar perspective as Image A, generally maintaining convergence toward the implied skylight at the top.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the tonal gradients on the walls and floor, particularly the darker shadows near the base and lighter areas under the skylight, preserved?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, tonal gradients on the walls are present, with layers of shading suggesting light effects from a light source above and shadows near the base. However, the floor is obscured by the dragon sculpture, therefore specific tonal details on the floor like darker shadows or lighter areas cannot be specifically discerned.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Are the individual wooden planks of the floor rendered with fine parallel lines to indicate texture and grain?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the floor is largely obscured by the dragon sculpture, and the fine details of individual wooden planks indicated by parallel lines and grain as observed in Image A are not visible. Thus, the texture and grain of the wooden floor cannot be confirmed.",
    "answer": "No"
