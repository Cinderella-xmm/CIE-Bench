      "question": "Does the hammer retain its claw-shaped end and dual-headed structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer clearly has a claw-shaped end, which is indicative of a typical claw hammer used in carpentry. Additionally, the hammer has a metallic head aligned with what is commonly seen in such tools. By examining these features, it's apparent that Image B presents a hammer with a dual-headed structure consisting of the striking face on one side and the claw on the other, which are characteristics typical of claw hammers.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the chisel retain its flat, rectangular blade with a beveled edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a tool that resembles a chisel with a flat and rectangular blade that features a beveled edge. These are common characteristics associated with woodworking chisels as they are designed to carve and shape wood. The presence of these definitive features in Image B confirms the tool retains its typical chisel blade characteristics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the file retain its long, straight, narrow shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The file in Image B exhibits the long, straight, and narrow profile which is indicative of standard hand files used for smoothing or shaping materials. Such files are designed in this manner to facilitate handling and precise work over various surfaces, aligning with the visual depiction found in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the tools positioned in the same relative arrangement as in the original image (e.g., hammer diagonal, chisel crossing file)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In examining Image B, it becomes apparent that the arrangement of tools has shifted significantly. In Image A, tools were positioned such that the hammer lay diagonally with others crossing it. Meanwhile, Image B arranges the tools in a more parallel and organized order without crossing each other, indicating a more streamlined layout.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shavings retain their curled, ribbon-like shape and approximate distribution around the tools?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals that the shavings have maintained a curled, ribbon-like shape consistent with wood shavings. However, the distribution around the tools in Image B appears more deliberate and less scattered than in Image A. Thus, while the shape is retained, the distribution shows a distinct difference compared to Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there exactly five tools present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, we can count the tools visible as follows: hammer, chisel, file, a wrench-like tool, and one more smaller tool resembling a small pry bar or nail puller. This adds up to precisely five separate tools presented in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the wrench-like tool retain its open-ended jaw and metal shaft shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a wrench-like tool with a visibly open-ended jaw, synonymous with what's commonly seen in adjustable or fixed spanners, along with a metallic shaft. This design highlights its function for gripping bolts and nuts, ensuring the tool retains its defining shape and structure.",
