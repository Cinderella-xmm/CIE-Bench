    "Question": "Q1: Is the scientist depicted with her right hand holding a pipette or similar instrument, angled toward the test tubes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the calendar illustration shows the scientist using her right hand to hold a pipette or similar instrument, angled toward the test tubes, consistent with typical imagery of laboratory work where such instruments are frequently used to handle liquids in test tubes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there multiple test tubes arranged in metal racks, containing teal or greenish-blue liquid?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration includes racks of test tubes where the liquid appears in a color that can be interpreted as teal or greenish-blue according to the artistic style, suggesting the depiction of a laboratory setting with chemical substances.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a microscope visible on the right side of the workbench, with an eyepiece and stage clearly defined?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration does not depict a microscope on the right side of the workbench. Rather, it focuses on other laboratory equipment and digital screens, and the style may simplify or abstract elements.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there two digital screens in the background displaying circular, intricate, symmetrical molecular or crystalline patterns in blue-green tones?",
    "explanation": "Image B portrays two screens in the background with blue-green patterns, which appear circular and symmetrical, illustrating typical molecular or crystalline structures found in scientific settings.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the scientist wear a white lab coat and round-framed glasses?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the representation of the scientist includes a white lab coat and glasses that can be assumed to be round-framed, aligning with common representations of scientists in a lab environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
