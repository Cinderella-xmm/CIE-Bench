      "question": "Is the squirrel standing upright on its hind legs with its front paws clasped together near the chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel is depicted in an upright position with its paws together near its chest, reflecting a common stance for squirrels, especially in illustrations and cartoons designed for storytelling or children's books. This pose is often used to convey attentiveness or curiosity, which is typical in anthropomorphic character designs.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the squirrel have a large, bushy tail that curves upward and outward, extending above the back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows that the squirrel has a tail that is depicted not in the realistic bushy curve seen in real squirrels (as in Image A) but rather in a stylized form. The tail is curvaceous and exaggerated, consistent with cartoon representations where features are often dramatized for appeal and visibility within illustrations.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ears of the squirrel rounded and positioned on top of the head, with a visible pink inner surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ears are indeed rounded and positioned on the top of the head, consistent with typical cartoon illustrations which emphasize these features for clarity and adorability. However, the pink inner surface is not visible as the coloring is uniform with the overall cartoon aesthetic. In contrast, Image A shows realistically textured ears with a visible pink inner surface.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the eyes large, round, dark, and located symmetrically on either side of the face, with visible pupils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B highlights the cartoon style where the squirrel's eyes are exaggeratedly large, round, and dark, with pupils clearly visible. These features are typical in illustrations designed for children to enhance expressiveness and relatability. Therefore, compared to Image A, which features more realistic eye proportions, the answer for Image B remains as described.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the head proportionally smaller than the body, with the tail approximately equal in length to the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel's head is designed in cartoonish proportions which typically feature larger heads to convey personality and emotion. The tail, while curvaceous and prominent, doesn't appear to be equal in length to the body; this differs from realistic animal proportions where the tail may be more aligned in proportion to the body length as seen in Image A.",
