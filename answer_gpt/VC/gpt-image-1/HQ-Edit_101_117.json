      "question": "Are the floral and paisley embroidery patterns present and accurately replicated as carved reliefs on the saree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the saree on the sculpture displays patterns that resemble floral and paisley designs. These are common motifs found in traditional Indian sarees and can be recognized as such even when translated into a carved relief form. The raised patterns mimic the detailing typically seen in embroidery. Meanwhile, Image A shows an actual saree with these vibrant embroidery patterns. The transition from fabric to stone relief maintains the essence of the original design, capturing the intricate detail and flow of the motifs.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon close inspection, no ring detail is apparent on the index finger of the right hand.
