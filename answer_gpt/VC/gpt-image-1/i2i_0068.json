        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seated person appears to be holding the cake with both hands. This can be deduced from the hand positioning and the visible grip on the cake plate.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the standing person's arm is raised, suggesting a motion of throwing or placing something. The grip and motion give the impression that they are still mid-action of throwing the gray object over the seated person's head. Comparing this with Image A, the standing person is captured in a similar position, indicating the action remains unchanged.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the candles on the cake as being lit with a soft glow. Through observation of the candle flames in the edited image, they appear illuminated softly, consistent with candle lighting. In Image A, this characteristic is also present, hence confirming that the soft glow of the candlelight is retained in Image B.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B shows a refrigerator present in the background, indicating a visible feature with a glass door and drink items. This aligns with Image A, where the refrigerator is also a prominent backdrop element, confirming its continued presence in the edited scene.",

      "explanation": "Image B depicts a warm and evenly distributed lighting across the environment, inferred from the even light and shadow spread and the warm tones in the scene. Comparing to Image A, where similar lighting conditions prevail, it is evident that the image editing preserved the initial lighting ambiance.",
