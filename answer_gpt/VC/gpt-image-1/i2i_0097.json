      "question": "Does the plate retain its circular shape and raised rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plate has a circular shape which can be deduced from the round symmetrical form with smooth edges. The raised rim is evident from the shading and the visual depth formed around the edge, indicating the curvature typical of raised rims on plates. Circular plates with raised rims are commonly designed this way to keep food contained, a standard design for dinnerware.",

      "question": "Is the plate still white in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the plate displays a white color. This is derived from the visual appearance, where the predominant shade is whiteâ€”both in hue and saturation. Typically, plates are often crafted in white for a clean and neutral presentation that enhances the aesthetic appeal of food.",

      "question": "Does the spoon retain its metallic finish and reflective surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the spoon with a shiny, metallic finish that reflects light, indicated by the highlights and shadows seen on its surface. This reflective characteristic and metallic appearance are typical for spoons, often crafted from stainless steel or similar materials, which provide durability and a polished look.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the spoon still oriented vertically on the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spoon is positioned along the vertical axis of the plate, with the handle at the bottom and the head at the top. This vertical orientation is a common presentation format often used in imagery where symmetry and balance are desired. The consistent alignment along the vertical axis highlights this positioning.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the plate and spoon are centrally located within the frame. The positioning is evident from their placement in the middle of the image with equal spacing around, which is typical for images intending to emphasize the objects as the focal point. Center alignment in such visuals helps in drawing attention to the subject matter.",
