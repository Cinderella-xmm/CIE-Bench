    "Question": "Q1: Is the man’s white beard and mustache clearly present and retaining their original shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, observing the area where the man's beard and mustache would be located, they are not visible due to the blurred effect employed. This prevents any clarity regarding the presence or the shape of the beard and mustache.
