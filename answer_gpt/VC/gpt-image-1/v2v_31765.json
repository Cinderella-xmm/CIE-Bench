      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vegetables on the left are visually represented with an orange color.

      "question": "Do the green vegetable pieces in the center of the image have a curved, C-shaped form with a visible hollow center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vegetable pieces in the center are depicted as green and have a distinct curved, C-shaped form with a visible hollow center. This form is characteristic of sliced celery, known for its curved shape and hollow center. Hence, the green vegetable pieces do have a curved, C-shaped form with a visible hollow center.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the diced vegetables on the right side appear to have a pale or light color. While the stylized image may not depict exact translucency, the color and shape suggest that these are onions, which are typically pale white when diced. Therefore, they can be described as pale white or resembling translucency.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a depiction of a knife located in the upper right portion. The knife is illustrated with characteristics that suggest a metallic blade and a black handle. These features are typical of kitchen knives, corroborating the presence of a knife with these attributes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface beneath the knife and vegetables does not resemble a traditional wooden cutting board with visible horizontal grain. Instead, the surface is stylized with geometric shapes and colors and does not exhibit a wooden texture or grain pattern. Therefore, the surface does not appear as a wooden cutting board with visible horizontal grain.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the vegetables sorted into three distinct piles from left to right: orange carrots, green celery pieces, and pale white onions. They are arranged in a linear sequence rather than a triangular pattern. Therefore, the arrangement does not form a triangular configuration.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
