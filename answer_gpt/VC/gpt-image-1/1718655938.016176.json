      "question": "Is there a cross at the very top of the church's steeple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church is illustrated with a whimsical and stylized design typical of candy or fantasy landscapes. At the top of the steeple, there is a clearly visible cross. This conclusion is made by identifying the simple geometric shape of the cross at the top of the steeple, which matches world knowledge of how churches are often depicted.",

      "question": "Is there a glowing arched doorway located at the front center of the church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a church with a distinct glowing arched doorway at its center, emitting a warm yellow-orange light. This depiction aligns with the common portrayal of a welcoming church entrance. My analysis comes from observing the color contrast and light emanating from this specific section, which suggests that it is an arched doorway typical of entry points to churches or similar structures.",

      "question": "Is there a winding dirt path extending from the foreground toward the churchâ€™s entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a path leading towards the church entrance. However, it is depicted in a stylized manner typical of candy landscapes with a non-natural color scheme. This contrasts with Image A's more realistic depiction. Thus, although there's a path, it's not a 'dirt' path due to its fantastical illustration style and bright colors. By examining the design choice, it matches imagination and fantasy-style artwork reasoning.",

      "question": "Is there a large arched stained-glass window positioned directly above the main entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an arched window above the main entrance of the church, which is typical of stained-glass window designs seen in churches. However, the image conveys a simplified and cartoonified version that does not clearly demonstrate the detailed stained-glass style seen in actual churches or realistic depictions. Given the stylization in Image B, although it mimics the structure of a stained-glass window, it does not convincingly feature stained glass based on textual expectation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there two narrow windows flanking the main doorway and one additional window visible on the side wall of the church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church structure includes two narrow windows flanking the central glowing doorway, along with an additional window visible on the side wall. The depiction aligns with common architectural design, where multiple windows provide light and aesthetic balance. Observing this setup follows a typical reasoning structure from world knowledge of traditional church window placements and confirmation through visual cues in the image.",
