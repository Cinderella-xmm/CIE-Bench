      "question": "Is the sandwich cross-section with layered ingredients clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a stylized, cartoon-like depiction of a sandwich. Although the portrayal is artistic, it clearly shows layered ingredients such as lettuce and cheese within the cross-section of the sandwich. The visual cues in the cartoon suggest that the layers are distinguishable by using varied colors and shapes to represent the different ingredients. This simplification still communicates the presence of layers effectively in an illustrative manner.",

      "question": "Does the sandwich bread retain its golden-brown crust appearance despite the cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon style conveys the texture and color of a golden-brown crust through the use of warm, yellowish-brown tones that resemble a baked crust. This stylistic choice reflects the typical appearance of sandwich bread, maintaining the essence of its original look despite the transition to a cartoon format.",

      "question": "Does the sandwich remain on the white, rectangular plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the sandwich on a white plate with a rectangular shape. The plate's outlines and presence, although stylized, are consistent with the depiction of a rectangular plate, similar to Image A. The design and placement suggest that the sandwich is, indeed, still on a plate that appears rectangular in context.",

      "question": "Does the background still depict a wooden table surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon representation uses a warm, orange-brown color scheme for the background, resembling the color of a wooden table from Image A. While the cartoon does not show detailed wood grain, the color choice implies a wooden context through abstraction and artistic representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sandwich positioned centrally on the plate as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the sandwich is slightly off-center due to its positioning on the plate and perspective. In Image B, the cartoon exaggerates the central focus on the sandwich, yet due to artistic distortion, the precise centering is not as clear. Comparing both, it retains an overall central impression typical of artistic depictions.",
