      "question": "Does the surfer maintain his original balancing posture on the manta ray?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfer appears to have a similar posture as in Image A, with a slightly bent posture, arms outstretched for balance, and feet positioned on his surfing platform, which is now a manta ray instead of a surfboard. This alignment suggests that the original balancing posture is maintained despite the change from surfboard to manta ray. The visual cues such as the orientation of his arms and legs support this conclusion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the original wave formation preserved, with the surfer riding on top of it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfer is depicted riding a manta ray above the ocean waves, rather than on top of the waves themselves as in Image A. This indicates a significant alteration from the original wave-riding position, as he is positioned above the water rather than interacting directly with the wave formation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ocean waters around the wave consistent with their appearance in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a fantastical setting with dramatic waves that differ from the more realistic ocean waters in Image A. The color palette and texture of the water in Image B are stylized to match the imaginary context, deviating from the original appearance of the ocean waters. This visual change reflects the transformation from a realistic scene to a fantastical depiction.",

      "question": "Is the horizon line and clear sky from the original image retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a sky that appears more artistic and stylized, with clouds and atmospheric elements, distinct from the clear sky and straightforward horizon line in Image A. The absence of the original clean horizon and clear sky signifies a departure from the initial image setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the surfer is depicted wearing black swim shorts and is shirtless. This consistency indicates that while other aspects of the scene have transformed, the attire of the surfer has not changed, retaining the original visual element regarding his clothing and appearance.",
