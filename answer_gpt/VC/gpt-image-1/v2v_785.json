      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is illustrated with a typical manga style, capturing the fine details of a character's appearance in the manga format.

      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted wearing a shirt that is colored similarly to how a red shirt would appear in a manga style.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the frisbee is shown using bright green colors typical in manga to represent brightness and vibrancy.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a background that features elements of a park such as grass and trees, which are stylized in a way typical for manga.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the manga shows the character holding a frisbee in Panel 1, and in Panel 2, the character is depicted in a throwing motion, with the frisbee flying away.
