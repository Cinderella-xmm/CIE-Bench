      "question": "Is the circular gold-tone MK logo charm present and clearly visible on the model’s attire or accessories?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the model features a circular gold-tone MK logo charm prominently placed on her attire, around the chest area, mimicking the charm seen on the handbag in Image A. This reflects the incorporation of the same branded element from the bag into the edited image. The charm is distinguishable as part of the model's overall outfit aesthetic.",

      "question": "Is the \"MICHAEL KORS\" brand name visible in gold uppercase letters near the upper right area of the model’s attire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible representation of the 'MICHAEL KORS' brand name in gold uppercase letters, particularly not near the upper right area of the model’s attire. The model's outfit is a sleek black dress without text branding, unlike the handbag in Image A which prominently features the brand name.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the model wearing a dress that indeed has a texture visually similar to the pebbled leather material of the original bag in Image A. This texture is clearly visible and mimics the luxurious leather pattern typical of Michael Kors products, indicating a stylistic design choice carried over from the original bag image.",

      "question": "Are gold-tone hardware elements (such as buckles, zippers, or clasps) visibly incorporated into the model’s accessories or outfit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the model's outfit incorporates gold-tone accessories such as earrings and a bracelet, which complement the theme of the gold-tone hardware seen on the bag in Image A. Although these aren't identical hardware elements like those on the bag, they serve to enhance the luxurious aesthetic similarly.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is no visible zippered pocket with a gold-tone pull on the side of the model’s dress or outfit. This particular detail, present in Image A's handbag, is not part of the model's outfit in the edited image.",

      "question": "Are the curved handle shapes reflected in the model’s arm or posture alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the model's pose creatively mirrors the curved handle shape by extending her arms upwards, almost framing her head in a similar fashion to the handbag handles in Image A. This artistic choice effectively draws a parallel between the model's posture and the distinct handles of the bag, signifying a deliberate design transformation.",
