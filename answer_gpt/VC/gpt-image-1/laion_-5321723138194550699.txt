    "Question": "Q3: Is the 'AMERICAN EXPRESS' text visible along the leading edge of the wing?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not show the text 'AMERICAN EXPRESS' along the leading edge of the wing. Instead, there are action lines suggesting speed and motion, which fits the style and theme of a comic-inspired graphic. Comparing this with Image A, where the text is clearly visible, confirms its absence in Image B due to the stylized transformation of the original image to fit an artistic format. The analysis hinges on recognizing text placement and artistic decisions in Image B.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the driver visible inside the cockpit with a helmet on?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a stylized version of the car, and the driver within the cockpit isn't distinctly visible nor is there detail resembling a helmet. This absence correlates with the simplified and graphic nature of the depiction. In contrast, Image A includes clear visibility of the driver, highlighting the significant editing and artistic decisions made in Image B. The conclusion is drawn from identifying typical elements in stylized images where such details are often minimized.",
