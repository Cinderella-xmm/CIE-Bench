    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain exactly six wheels arranged in three axles, with the front axle near the cab and two rear axles supporting the cargo body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the edited truck is depicted as a crystal model that clearly displays six wheels arranged in three axles, with one axle near the cab and two supporting the cargo body. This consistent arrangement is evident through the clear division of the wheels and their positioning relative to the cab and body. Comparing with Image A, the same six-wheel, three-axle setup is observed, affirming the retention of this design feature from the original vehicle.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the cargo body positioned directly behind the cab, maintaining the same horizontal alignment and proportional length as in the original image?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a crystal rendition of a truck where the cargo body is indeed positioned directly behind the cab, conserving the horizontal alignment with the cab as seen in trucks. The proportionality appears consistent, which is also verified upon observing Image A, where the cargo body follows a similar positioning and proportion relative to the cab.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there two rectangular windows visible on the side of the cargo body, located approximately one-third and two-thirds along its length?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the windows integrated into the crystal model, positioned along the cargo body with proportions aligning closely to the designated one-third and two-thirds placement. Upon comparison with Image A, these rectangular windows are directly visible in a similar arrangement, confirming the spatial consistency between the images.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the vertical slatted grille present on the front of the vehicle, centered between the headlights and aligned with the hood?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the design of the crystal truck includes distinctive vertical slats incorporated into the grille, positioned centrally between the headlights and in alignment with the hood. The grille configuration corresponds to Image A’s vehicle design, where the slatted grille is similarly located and structured.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a side mirror attached to the driver’s side door, extending outward from the upper portion of the door?",
    "explanation": "Image B illustrates a crystal truck where observing details like the side mirror is challenging due to the material's reflective properties. From the perspective of Image A, the side mirror extends from the upper portion of the door. However, no extension of a mirror is distinctly or similarly visible in Image B, thus indicating the absence of the detail.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a horizontal ladder affixed to the lower side of the cargo body, running parallel to the ground?",
    "explanation": "Image B doesn’t seem to feature a horizontal ladder design affixed to the cargo body in a way that notably runs parallel to the ground. Image A has a similarly ambiguous presence regarding a ladder, with any possible structure not clearly depicted in the edited version. Observations support that no ladder is notably visible.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is there a silver-colored door handle visible on the driver’s side door, positioned midway down the door?",
    "explanation": "In Image B’s crystal truck illustration, door handles retain a unified, green coloration matching the truck's body, making specific identification challenging. Silver door handles are absent in Image B. However, in Image A, a more conventional metallic handle is visible midway on the door, differentiating it from the edited image's design aesthetic.",
    "answer": "No"
