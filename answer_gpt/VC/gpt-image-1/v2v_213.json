      "question": "Does the edited image retain the specific black spots and white markings on the butterfly's wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's wings are constructed using a pixelated block style, which resembles digital pixel art. The specific arrangement and presence of black spots and white markings are visible in a stylized form typical of the allure of digital creations, emulating the original form's patterns in geometric abstraction. Thus, the patterns are retained, albeit in a pixelated style.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the fuzzy texture of the butterfly's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the butterfly is depicted in a blocky, pixelated style, which inherently lacks any form of texture found in physical reality, such as fuzziness. The bodyâ€™s texture is interpreted in geometric pixel forms without any fuzzy texture, indicating that such fine details are not retained.",

      "question": "Is the butterfly still positioned on the wooden surface in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is shown floating isolated against a plain background devoid of any indications of a wooden surface. This suggests the environment context has been removed in favor of a simplified artistic representation. Therefore, the butterfly is not positioned on a wooden surface anymore.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the butterfly in a pixelated, block form suggesting an intentional abstraction devoid of the natural textures commonly associated with real butterfly wings. The transformation into a block style inherently eliminates delicate textures in favor of simpler geometric shapes.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the specific arrangement of spots on the butterfly's wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the stylized pixelated form, the butterfly wings display an arrangement of spots reminiscent of the original markings. This implies that the specific arrangement is maintained as per the stylized approach apparent in the edited image, represented in pixelated format.",
