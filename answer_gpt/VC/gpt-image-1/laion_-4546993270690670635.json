      "question": "Is the subject seated upright with the back supported by a chair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is sitting in a chair with an intricately designed backrest visible behind him. The posture appears upright, suggesting support from the chair's back. This conclusion is drawn based on the symmetry of the upper body and the visibility of the chair's back, indicating an upright seated position.",

      "question": "Are the hands positioned together on the lap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hands are resting on a table or desk, holding a quill. They are not positioned on the lap but are visibly engaged in a writing activity, suggesting a different position than resting together on the lap.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurred face in Image B is directly above the subject's torso and appears to be centered within the frame. The subject is seated in a frontal position, which supports the head being centered above the torso.",

      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the subject's right arm seems to be resting, there is no visible armrest directly beneath the right hand. The table surface seems flat without an armrest feature specifically for the hand.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's arms are bent at the elbows but not resting along the sides of the body. Instead, the subject's arms are forward, actively engaged in writing, as indicated by the position of the hands with a quill.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show the lower half of the body, including the legs, making it impossible to visually assess whether the legs are positioned symmetrically beneath the torso.",
