      "question": "Are the battery tops rendered in copper color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, there are no batteries depicted, but rather characters designed with a bold copper color scheme. The central characters are equipped with copper-colored armor, which can be interpreted as representing the classic Duracell copper top. Without directly showing batteries, the copper color hints at this familiar branding element.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the word \"DURACELL\" printed vertically in white on the black body of each battery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no batteries with vertical white DURACELL text in the traditional sense. Instead, the word 'DURACELL' is prominently displayed on the chest of the central character in white, but horizontally. This deviates from the expected vertical layout typically seen on actual batteries.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a silver band near the base of each battery with the word \"DURALOCK\" inscribed on it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature any batteries with the silver 'DURALOCK' inscription. Instead, it presents a dynamic superhero theme, likely alluding to power preservation as seen in the attitude of the characters. The original representation of this detail in a battery-centric design is missing in Image B.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the phrase \"10 Years in Storage\" visibly present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the phrase '10 Years in Storage' is distinctly visible towards the bottom right within a sign held by one of the characters. This indicates a similar promise of long-lasting power, consistent with the original product's emphasis on durability.",

      "question": "Are there exactly four batteries or battery-inspired characters depicted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, four battery-inspired characters are illustrated, reminiscent of the number of batteries seen in typical product packaging, hence adapting the concept of 'four' into the edited image.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently displays 'DURACELL' in large, bold letters at the top, similar to the branding emphasis seen on product packaging, aligning with common marketing tactics to ensure brand visibility.",
