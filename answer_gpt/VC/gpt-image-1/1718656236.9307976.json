        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows the face region blurred, making it impossible to assess the specific details of facial structure, such as the eyes, nose, and lips. Without explicit visual information in the edited image, it's inconclusive to determine whether the facial structure is retained.",

The garment design primarily focuses on pattern and color, making the identification of sleeves challenging.",
