    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the subject's facial expression, including a wide smile showing teeth and eyes looking upward to the left, preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial details are obscured, preventing a direct assessment of the expression. However, observing the body language and posture can sometimes offer context. Without specific facial expressions visible due to the blurring, it's not possible to confirm if any specific expression like a wide smile showing teeth is maintained.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the subject's head turned slightly to the left, maintaining the original angle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the position of the subject's head with respect to the body appears neutral and straightforward. The lack of visual cues indicating a specific head turn due to the curtain leaves it unclear whether there's a gentle turn of the head.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the subject's hands clasped gently in front of the torso, with fingers interlaced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands of the subject are not interlaced but are gently clasped together. The fingers appear neatly arranged, but interlacing is specifically absent in this positioning.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the henna designs visible on the subject's palms and fingers preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hands are clasped with some rings visible, but there are no visible henna designs on the palms or fingers. This indicates that any prior art on the hands was not included or emphasized in this representation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the arms with a natural and consistent skin tone that complements the lighting, which is warm and soft. Without notable discrepancies in tone or shadows, the arms appear to have a preserved natural look.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the subject's long, wavy brown hair flowing over the shoulders preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hair flows over the shoulders, exhibiting long, dark, and wavy characteristics. This presentation aligns with a similar natural hairstyle, indicative of the original design.",
