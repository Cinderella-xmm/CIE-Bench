    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the original four blades of the ceiling fan?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe contains a fan with four blades, indicating that the edited image retains the original design of the fan with four blades. The placement of four blades is consistent with common ceiling fan designs which are typically symmetrical and balanced. This observation aligns with common fan structures and setups, thus confirming their retention.",
    "answer": "yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the central hub structure of the ceiling fan still present in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "Analysis of Image B shows that the ceiling fan inside the snow globe continues to have a central hub, which is the structure where the blades are attached. Common knowledge about ceiling fans indicates that the central hub is an essential part for blade connection as seen in Image B, thus confirming its presence.",
    "answer": "yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the edited image preserve the metallic texture and color scheme of the ceiling fan?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ceiling fan inside the snow globe has blades colored differently (wooden tone) than the original metallic texture. The hub appears somewhat metallic, but without dominant metallic sheen that suggests complete preservation of the metallic texture. Given the change in blade color scheme from metallic to wooden tone, this suggests a departure from the original texture.",
    "answer": "no"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the blades arranged symmetrically around the central hub in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "The arrangement of blades in Image B remains symmetrical, similar to common ceiling fan configurations where blades are evenly distributed around the hub to ensure balanced rotation. This symmetrical arrangement is evident visually in Image B, verifying the preservation of symmetry.",
    "answer": "yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the connection points between the blades and the central hub visible in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays the fan blades connected visibly to the central hub within the snow globe. These connection points are crucial for fan functionality and are commonly visible in ceiling fan designs. The presence of visible connection points in the edited image confirms their retention.",
    "answer": "yes"
