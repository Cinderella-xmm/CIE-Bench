    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the red velvet cushion with visible quilted texture present beneath the saxophone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object resting on the cushion is a serpent resembling a horn, rather than a saxophone. The cushion still appears to be red velvet with a visible quilted texture under the serpent, similar to what would typically support an object like a saxophone, as seen in the object in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a thin gold trim running along the outer edge of the red cushion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cushion beneath the serpent does have a thin gold trim running along its outer edge, similar to the cushion seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the lighting source positioned above the saxophone, creating a bright central glow that fades into darkness toward the edges of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting source is positioned above the serpent, creating a bright spotlight effect around it that gradually fades into darkness toward the edges of the frame. This lighting setup mimics the scenario from Image A with the saxophone.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the saxophone (or transformed serpent) positioned diagonally across the cushion, extending from the lower left to the upper right of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed serpent is positioned in a curving posture rather than a straight diagonal across the cushion. The curve starts from the bottom and loops around, which doesn't mimic the lower left to upper right diagonal positioning seen in Image A with the saxophone.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background uniformly dark, with no visible objects or textures other than the spotlight glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is indeed uniformly dark except for the spotlight effect focused on the serpent. There are no other visible objects or textures in the background, similar to Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the transformed serpent retain a highly reflective, metallic surface with visible highlights and specular reflections consistent with polished brass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformed serpent in Image B has a metallic and reflective surface, adorned with bright gems. This shiny appearance with visible highlights and specular reflections suggests a material similar to polished brass, which is consistent with the saxophone from Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
