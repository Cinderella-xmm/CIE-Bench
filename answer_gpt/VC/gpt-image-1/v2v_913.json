      "question": "Does the cake retain its two distinct layers of dark chocolate sponge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a character that embodies the essence of a chocolate cake rather than the actual edible item. This illustrates a person with some design elements reminiscent of a cake structure, such as a two-layer design suggested by the outfit. However, this is a metaphorical representation using chibi art style, to transform the cake feedback into a fictional scenario. Recognizing the artistic transformation in Image B, the actual cake is not present with distinct sponge layers as depicted in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the top of the cake covered in a glossy, reflective chocolate glaze?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chocolate glaze is simulated by a hairstyle resembling flowing chocolate, as part of a stylized representation instead of an actual cake. The top of the character's head has a shiny appearance, mimicking the glossy glaze seen in an actual cake, but it is not a real cake surface as depicted in Image A.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there three visible streams of chocolate glaze dripping down the front face of the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B provides a fictional character impersonating a chocolate cake element. While the character has strands of hair or other elements that seem akin to drips, these are part of the character's design and do not match actual glaze streams on food as shown in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the cake layers exhibit a dark brown, moist, and porous sponge texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's design uses coloring and texture resembling chocolate cake layers. Although visually similar, they are stylized and lack the genuine sponge texture found on real desserts seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the cake placed on a white circular plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a stylized scenario where a character, resembling a cake concept, appears on a plate. However, this plate is a design element within the artistic representation rather than serving as a real cake's plate as depicted in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Does the cake maintain its triangular cross-sectional shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a personified cake representation, which inherently lacks the triangular shape characteristic of a cake slice. The character itself is cooperatively designed with cake-like features but maintains a human form rather than a geometric slice, differing from the triangular slice noted in Image A.",
