    "Question": "Q1: Is the four-legged base of the Eiffel Tower with a central archway present and clearly visible?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a significant transformation from the Eiffel Tower to a giant, robotic figure. The four-legged structure and archway, characteristic of the original Eiffel Tower, appear to have been replaced by this robotic entity's structure. The visual cue confirms that the traditional features of the Eiffel Tower's base are absent.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the classical-style building visible through the central arch of the tower?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central archway seen in a typical image of the Eiffel Tower is replaced by the lower part of the robotic figure. The space that usually allows a view of the distant building is blocked by this transformation, indicating that the building is not visible.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the symmetrical rows of trimmed green hedges present along both sides of the foreground?",
    "explanation": "Image B retains the original landscape architecture featuring symmetrical rows of trimmed green hedges on both sides, consistent with the image of a public park or garden. These elements are visible and appear aligned, confirming their presence.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there people visible sitting or walking on the grassy field in front of the tower?",

    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the sky gradient transitioning from deep blue at the top to orange near the horizon present?",
    "explanation": "The sky in Image B exhibits a smooth gradient transition, starting with deep blue at the top and gradually shifting to orange near the horizon. This reflects a typical evening or dawn sky, suggesting the characteristic gradient is maintained.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the embedded lights illuminating the hedges visible as glowing spots?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows glowing spots along the trimmed green hedges, indicating the presence of hidden lighting systems similar to those found in well-designed parks or gardens. These illuminated spots are clearly visible and help highlight the form and structure of the hedges.",
    "answer": "Yes"
