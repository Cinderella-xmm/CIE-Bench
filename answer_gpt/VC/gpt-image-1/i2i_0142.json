      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the image retain the tan leather texture and black stitching on the glove?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glove in Image B is illustrated as a cartoon or stylized graphic rather than a realistic depiction. While the color approximates tan, the texture and stitching are simplified rather than clearly representing leather with detailed black stitching. This artistic style does not focus on mimicking realistic textures or stitching details.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the baseball depicted in white with visible red stitching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the baseballs are shown with a white or light cream hue and red stitching, matching the common appearance of baseballs. The image successfully highlights the contrast between the white surface and red thread, typical of a standard baseball.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the top, side, and sectional views of the glove and ball preserving their respective 3D shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays multiple views of the glove and baseball, including top, side, and sectional angles. However, these are stylized and flattened, lacking the full 3D depth seen in realistic images, although they do attempt to maintain some semblance of depth as defined by their outlines.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the views show the baseball and glove in a way that clearly depicts their association as sports equipment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The various views in Image B include different perspectives of the glove and baseball, which show their forms and establish their relationship as part of baseball equipment, even in a stylized format. Their proximity and presentation clearly associate them with the sport.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image include a hint of a grass-like texture under the glove in at least one view?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict any grass or outdoor textures. It uses a plain, uniform background, focusing instead on the stylized presentation of the equipment rather than situating it in a context like Image A, which includes grass.",
