    "Question": "Q5: Is there a metal luggage rack mounted above the rear wheel?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object present is a mechanical insect, not a bicycle, so there is no rear wheel or luggage rack. While Image A might have these features, the edited content of Image B portrays a distinct insect design, precluding any such bicycle accessories.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q6: Are soft shadows cast by the bicycle onto the wall and floor, indicating directional lighting from the left?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanical insect casts shadows rather than a bicycle, but the image does show soft shadows implying directional lighting. However, since this image does not contain a bicycle, the specific detail of the shadow being cast by a bicycle is not applicable.",
