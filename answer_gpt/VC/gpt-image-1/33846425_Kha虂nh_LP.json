      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face is blurred, making it impossible to discern fine details like eye positions or facial expressions. Even though in typical artworks expressions might be depicted in detail, the current blur obstructs such details. Therefore, assessing specific expressions is not feasible.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is wearing a dress depicted with a light color and lace-like patterning. While detailed embroidery is not prominently visible due to the artistic style, the dress mimics the texture and design of lace with possible floral patterns.",
