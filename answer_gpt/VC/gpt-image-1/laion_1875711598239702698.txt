    "Question": "Q1: Is the trunk of each elephant still curved upward in the same manner as in the original?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the objects are not traditional elephant figurines but rather designed containers with elephant ear-like features on the lids or tops. These designs imply an elephant-like motif, but no actual trunk detail is seen as in Image A, where the elephant figurines have distinct upward-curved trunks. Hence, Image B does not feature trunks at all.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the ears of both elephants still present in their original flared shape and position?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the motif involves ear-like elements on the top of the bottles or containers, which mimic the shape of elephant ears. These are ideally positioned to represent an elephant but are not in the same place as the actual flared ears of the elephant figurines in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the oval-shaped mosaic pattern located on the back of each elephant, centered and bordered by gold trim?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a mosaic pattern on the front of the bottles, which resembles the elephant's back pattern but is not precisely centered or bordered as in the traditional oval shape seen on the elephant figurines in Image A. It's more of a modeled design adhering to part of the bottle's surface.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do both elephants retain golden-colored tusks positioned near the mouth?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a more abstract representation of elephants with no visible mouths or tusks, unlike Image A, where the elephant figurines have distinct golden tusks positioned near their mouths.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a decorative band with scrollwork pattern around the lower body of each elephant?",
    "explanation": "The bottles in Image B do not have any decorative band with a scrollwork pattern like those on the lower body of the elephant figurines in Image A. All details in Image B are more abstract and formalized to fit the perfume bottle style.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the eyes of both elephants positioned on the sides of the head and colored dark?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the design doesn't include detailed eyes like the elephant figurines in Image A, where the eyes are detailed, positioned on the side of the head, and dark. Image B leans more towards an abstract interpretation without such details.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the larger elephant positioned to the left and the smaller one to the right, maintaining their original relative size?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the relative size and position of the bottles match that of the elephant figurines in Image A, where the larger figure is on the left and the smaller one is on the right, thus maintaining the same layout and relative size.",
    "answer": "Yes"
