      "question": "Is the white marking on the dog's snout and muzzle clearly visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's snout and muzzle area show clear and prominent white markings. This distinct feature is typically visible because it provides high contrast against the darker areas of the dog's fur, making it easy to discern visually. The image depicts these markings distinctly as expected on the breed's natural coloring.",

      "question": "Does the dog still have a predominantly black coat with clear contrast against the white markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B independently, the dog clearly has a predominantly dark or black coat, which provides a strong contrast to the white markings on its snout and muzzle. This contrast is visually striking and is typically a common characteristic of certain dog breeds, allowing the markings to stand out distinctly.",

      "question": "Is the dog depicted in a relaxed yet alert posture in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is positioned sitting or resting, which often indicates a relaxed state. However, the dog is also gazing forward with an attentive look, suggesting alertness. The overall demeanor combines elements of being at ease yet ready to react, which aligns with common behavioral observations of dogs seen in a resting pose with watchful expressions.",

      "question": "Are the dog's ears positioned naturally in relation to its head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dog's ears placed at a natural angle relative to its head, indicating that they are not modified or positioned unnaturally. This natural ear posture is consistent with how dogs, especially those of the American Staffordshire Terrier breed, carry their ears when at rest and alert.",

      "question": "Do the dog's eyes retain their reflective quality in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dog's eyes with a discernible reflective quality. Animals, particularly mammals like dogs, often have eyes that catch and reflect light, giving a shiny appearance. This is usually especially visible in photography due to the illumination used during a shot, showcasing the reflective and expressive nature of the dog's eyes.",
