      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the car retain the distinctive angular LED headlights and central grille intake characteristic of the McLaren 720S?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car resembles the McLaren style with angular designs but is incorporated into a small display or model, making definitive identification challenging. The headlights appear as stylized elements consistent with hyper-realistic or model depictions, lacking the sharp definition of actual McLaren headlights. Without clear angular LED headlights and the central grille intake visible due to scale and stylization, these features are more representative rather than definitive of a McLaren 720S.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the road still a curved two-lane highway with continuous double yellow lines running down its center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a diorama or model of the environment behind glass, where the road maintains its curved nature and displays two lanes. The double yellow lines continue to run down the center in this representation, suggesting a highway.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the left-hand hillside still present with its reddish-brown slopes and scattered autumnal vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The left-hand hillside in Image B is depicted in the model with a strong emphasis on red and brown hues, capturing an autumnal landscape. The scattered vegetation is represented in a stylized manner consistent with a diorama or art piece.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a concrete guardrail along the right side of the road, separating it from the ocean?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the modeling captures what appears to be a modern representation of a guardrail section, but due to its display nature and aesthetics, its concrete material isn't discernible. The concept of separation is visually maintained though.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the car positioned centrally on the right side of the road, facing forward toward the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car is displayed in a small model box environment, aligned with the road structure, facing towards the glass as the perspective suggests the horizon. Its precise positioning slightly varies from the expected visual description.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are rocky outcrops visible in the distant sea, with mist or spray rising near the shore?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Image B display captures an idealized backdrop that hints at rocky outcrops and coastal scenery. While the mist or spray aren't detailed due to their visual description in the miniaturized model, the presence and attempt to capture such features remain noticeably similar.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car is a miniaturized model, and specific interior details like red racing seats with black accents aren't discernible through the windshield, focusing more on external aesthetics.",
