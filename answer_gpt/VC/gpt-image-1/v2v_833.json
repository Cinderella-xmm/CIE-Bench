      "question": "Does the subject maintain the iconic pose and subtle smile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited version presents the subject as a chibi-style character with simplified features, likely eliminating the subtle smile that is characteristic of the original pose. The chibi character appears to replicate the pose, but the focus on charm and simplicity in chibi style usually ignores intricate details like subtle smiles.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
