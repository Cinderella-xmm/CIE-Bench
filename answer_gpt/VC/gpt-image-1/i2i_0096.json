      "question": "Is the sofa still black with multiple cushions evenly arranged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sofa is clearly black, matching the commonly known color. The visual clues show multiple cushions placed on the sofa, indicating they are evenly arranged more or less throughout the seating area, which aligns with typical interior decor knowledge. The material and texture look consistent with what one would expect for such a setting, giving a uniform and visually balanced appearance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visually, Image B shows a painting with distinctive swirling patterns, dominated by warm orange and red hues that form a central vortex. This is consistent with the typical recognition of such abstract artworks whereby the central theme remains colorful, dynamic, and circular reflecting a vortex design.",

      "question": "Is the painting still hung directly above the sofa?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the painting is clearly positioned directly above the sofa, adhering to common interior design practices where artwork is placed centrally above seating furniture to create a focal point in the room. The alignment in Image B emphasizes this typical arrangement.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the wall to be a neutral light color, most likely white or a pale shade. This is supported by the way light and shadows are rendered on the surface, which is typical of light-colored walls that reflect natural light effectively, creating a clean, bright ambiance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are distinct light patterns and shadow lines visible on the wall, suggesting sunlight streaming through a nearby window. This is common in brightly lit rooms where natural light interacts with the interior elements such as wall surfaces, demonstrating typical light dynamics expected in a daylight setting.",
