      "question": "Is the skateboard's distinct elongated rectangular shape with rounded ends retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard maintains the elongated rectangular shape with rounded ends, characteristic of typical skateboards. The visual representation has been modified in a stained glass or vibrant mosaic style, but the basic shape and outline are clearly retained, which is evident when compared to standard knowledge of skateboard designs.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the stainless steel sink's oval shape and placement on the countertop retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sink's placement and relative position on the countertop are retained compared to a typical kitchen setup. The depiction in a mosaic or stained glass pattern might give it a stylized appearance, but the visual cue of the faucet and slight curvature indicating an oval shape affirm its position and shape retention.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the wooden cabinets with silver handles and their arrangement retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the stylized transformation into a stained glass-like design, the layout and structure of the wooden cabinets, including the placement of handles, remain consistent with what is expected based on the original cabinet design. The distinct lines and segments indicate the retention of these features.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the skateboard still leaning against the cabinet in the same position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skateboard in Image B retains its position leaning against the cabinet, as can be deduced from its adjacent placement relative to the cabinet doors and handles. Despite the artistic style altering the texture and color, the overall positioning of the skateboard remains untouched from what is likely the expected leaning orientation in practical use.",

      "question": "Are the beige tile patterns on the floor and white tile patterns on the wall retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tile patterns on the wall and floor in Image B have been dramatically transformed into a vibrant, multicolored mosaic style, away from the plain beige and white tones expected in Image A based on common kitchen design. This shift in color choice and pattern style indicates the original patterns are not retained, as evidenced by the bold and varied color scheme now present.",
