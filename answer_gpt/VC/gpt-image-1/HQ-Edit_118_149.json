      "question": "Is the dancer’s left leg extended vertically upward in a full arabesque, with the right foot en pointe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, it shows cartoon-like characters portraying ballet dancers. The designs mimic ballet positions. One figure on the cover shows a dancer with the left leg extended vertically upward, which aligns with a full arabesque, while the other leg is supporting the body with the foot en pointe. Without comparing it directly to Image A, based solely on the cartoon interpretation of ballet positions present in Image B.",

      "question": "Are both feet wearing pink pointe shoes with visible ribbons wrapped around the ankles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration in Image B features two cartoon characters of ballet dancers. Each character's feet are drawn to suggest pointe shoes. However, because of the stylized nature, ribbons around the ankles aren't distinctly visible. The illustration aims to capture essence more than specific details like ribbons on shoes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon figures are designed to represent young ballet dancers, which typically includes hair styled in a bun to match ballet norms. Observing these figures, they do feature rounded shapes where a bun would be and are consistent with a typical ballet hairstyle.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon character on the left is illustrated in a pink leotard and white tights, which is a classic ballet attire. The simplified design of the sticker maintains the distinctive features of this outfit.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases cartoon characters with exaggerated and simplified poses for artistic effect. While one arm on the sticker is extended outward in an artistic, balletic manner, there is no barre depicted that would be held by another arm, which contrasts with the setup in Image A.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sticker characters in Image B, especially the dancer on the left, is depicted from a side view, facing right. These design elements infer a typical ballet stance that is side-profiled, sustaining the orientation description in the question.",
