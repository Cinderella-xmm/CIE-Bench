      "question": "Is the circular front plate with rivets on the steam locomotive present and accurately rendered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the steam locomotive is depicted with a stylized, chibi-style appearance which maintains prominent features such as the circular front plate. Despite the use of stylized proportions, the circular front plate with rivets remains visible and maintains its structure. In Image A, the locomotive's front plate is a key feature, traditionally adorned with rivets, which are indeed present in the chibi version as well.",

      "question": "Is the station building made of red brick with a gabled roof and two arched windows visible and unaltered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a chibi-style representation of the station building, which retains the appearance of being constructed from red brick. The gabled roof and the two arched windows are still present, albeit with a more stylized design reflecting the chibi art style. Comparing to Image A, the building elements are maintained, indicating that these features are considered essential and well-preserved in the edited image.",

      "question": "Are all individuals standing in their original positions on the platform, facing the train or grouped as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the individuals are converted into chibi-style characters and do resemble their positions and orientations loosely similar to Image A. However, the stylistic transformation slightly affects their distribution and facial direction due to the artistic freedom. The chibi art style often leads to arranging characters to enhance thematic coherence rather than exact duplication of positions.",

      "question": "Do all individuals wear the same clothing items as in the original image, including long dresses, suits, and hats?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the individuals in stylized form, but they are still wearing similar clothing items that distinguish their roles, like long dresses, suits, and hats analogous to Image A. The chibi style inherently simplifies and exaggerates clothing to maintain the essence while altering proportions. Despite this stylistic change, the primary clothing elements remain recognizable.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman near the edge is depicted holding a rectangular suitcase, similar to Image A. The position of the suitcase in her hand is consistent between the images, even with the transition to a chibi art style, reflecting the intent to maintain key visual cues such as the presence and positioning of objects.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the depiction of the railway tracks using a chibi art style, with the tracks made up of wooden sleepers and metal rails that extend diagonally in the same manner as in Image A. The artist has maintained key structural elements to ensure the viewer recognizes the setting and its physical layout.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, similar to Image A, a thick, dark plume of smoke is seen rising from the train's chimney. The depiction aligns with the traditional portrayal of steam locomotives, and the edited image continues this with a stylized yet appropriately rendered plume indicating a functioning steam engine.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is illustrated with warm tones that can suggest the lighting conditions of late afternoon, akin to Image A. The background sky appears artistically hazy, styled in a manner typical of afternoon settings in illustrations. This color scheme and atmosphere are common in chibi art to maintain warmth and nostalgic feel.",
