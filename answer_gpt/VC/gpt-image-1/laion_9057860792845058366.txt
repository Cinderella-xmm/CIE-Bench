    "Question": "Q1: Are the two orange horn-like protrusions on the top of the robot's head present and unchanged in shape and position?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the orange horn-like protrusions are visible on top of the robot's head and appear similar in shape and position to Image A. These protrusions are a characteristic detail often found in robot designs, possibly indicating antennas or decorative elements. Given their prominence in Image B, it seems they are unchanged.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the large red rectangular plate on the robot's chest intact, maintaining its original size, shape, and placement?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's chest does not feature a large red rectangular plate. Instead, there is a screen or display integrated into the chest area, eliminating any semblance of the red plate seen in Image A. This indicates that the red plate has been removed or significantly modified in the edited image.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the red knee pads present on both legs, positioned at the joint area and matching the original shape and color?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not display the red knee pads at the joint area as seen in Image A. The design of the robot's legs is more streamlined and advanced, suggesting a change in the style and detailing compared to Image A, where the knee pads are a distinct element.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the hands of the robot fully black, with a claw-like or articulated finger design, and positioned as in the original?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hands appear to be black with a claw-like finger design, similar to Image A. The coloration is consistent with the original image, but the pose and positioning change slightly; Image B focuses on a display interaction, suggesting some movement from the original arm positioning.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the robot’s feet maintain their angular, blocky shape with black toe segments and red accent plates near the ankles?",
    "explanation": "The robot's feet in Image B are angular and blocky, which is consistent with the design seen in Image A. However, the red accent plates are not clearly visible in the edited image. The color scheme in Image B appears to be more monochrome, with fewer accent details.",

    "Question": "Q6: Is the robot in the same dynamic standing pose, with the left arm slightly raised and the body angled toward the viewer?",
    "explanation": "Both images depict the robot in a standing pose, but the positioning in Image B is different from Image A. In Image B, the focus is on the interaction with the smart device, suggesting a more neutral posture rather than the dynamic standing pose with the left arm raised as in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the primary colors of the robot—white, gray, red, and orange—preserved in their original distribution and intensity?",
    "explanation": "Image B utilizes a much darker and uniform color scheme dominated by metallic shades, primarily of blue and orange highlights. The white, gray, and red colors from Image A are replaced by this new futuristic palette, transforming the visual impact and style of the robot completely.",
    "answer": "No"
