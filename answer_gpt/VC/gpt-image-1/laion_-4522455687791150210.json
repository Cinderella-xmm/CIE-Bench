    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the lime green body of the saree adorned with small golden diamond-shaped butis evenly distributed across the fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the saree appears to be carved out of stone, with the fabric and the design transformed into a uniformly colored stone surface. This appearance suggests a lack of distinguishable small golden diamond-shaped butis, due to the monochrome nature typical of stone sculptures.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the pallu feature a blue and gold striped pattern with repeating elephant motifs in gold zari?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire composition, including the pallu, appears to be uniformly and intricately carved in a stone-like material. The details such as the blue and gold striped pattern, and the elephant motifs are not discernible in a typical color or detail due to the monochromatic nature of a statue.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the blouse royal blue with golden embroidered detailing along the neckline and sleeve edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B transforms the entire fabric into a monochrome depiction typical of a stone statue, which lacks any color distinction like royal blue or specific embroidery details allowing such a description.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a necklace with red and green stones positioned around the neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire depiction including accessories like a necklace is done in a monochrome, stone-like material. This makes it impossible to identify distinctions like red and green stones, as there is no color contrast to suggest this.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there earrings matching the necklace visible in both ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not clearly depict earrings with color or intricate features that could match a necklace. All visible elements are unified in the appearance typical of a stone sculpture, making it difficult to determine if there are matching earrings.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a golden bangle present on the right wrist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all elements are consistent with a stone statue aesthetic, with no visible color or metallic distinctions to denote a golden bangle.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a bindi visible on the center of the forehead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given that Image B depicts the subject in a homogenous stone-like representation, no color or contrasting detail like a bindi on the forehead is perceptible.",
