      "question": "Is the winding stone path composed of irregular flat stones leading upward toward the central structure present in the same location and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene depicts a mystical, dark forest environment with a large tree at the center, with glowing green elements and no visible structured stone path. Image A contains a stone path leading to a castle, characterized by the presence of irregular flat stones in a natural, sunlit environment. Since neither a structured path nor upward orientation can be observed in Image B, it clearly indicates the absence of such a path.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the large, scattered rock formations visible along the grassy slope at the base of the structure preserved in their original positions and sizes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a woodland setting with roots and glowing figures, lacking any scattered rock formations. This is a stark contrast to Image A, where natural stone formations are visible at the base of a castle along the grassy slope. Since these rock formations are not preserved in Image B, it can be concluded that they are not maintained.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the tall, leafy trees forming a natural border on both the left and right edges of the image still present, maintaining their original height, density, and positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a dense, dark forest with intertwined trees and glowing figures, whereas Image A illustrates a more open environment, with trees flanking either side of a castle. The forest in Image B creates a very different atmospheric boundary, suggesting that the previous trees' original characteristics are not preserved.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sky above the castle still depicted with soft daylight and scattered white clouds against a pale blue background, preserving the original lighting quality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, a bright, soft daylight sky with clouds is present above the castle, while in Image B, the scene is enveloped by a dark and mystical ambiance without any indication of daylight or sky. Since the atmospheric conditions and sky characteristics differ entirely, the original sky is not preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the hillside beneath the castle still gently sloped upward from the foreground, covered in green grass and supporting the stone path and rocks in their original configuration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A features a gently sloping hillside with grass and stone path, leading up to a castle. In contrast, Image B presents a scene dominated by a forest with glowing elements and no visible slopes or hints of grass resembling that configuration, indicating a change in landscape.",
