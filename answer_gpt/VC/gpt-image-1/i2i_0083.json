      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armchairs appear to be upholstered in a brownish-orange fabric. The legs of the chairs are visible and made of wood, with a light, natural finish.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two armchairs positioned in a balanced manner, flanking the central area where a large image is displayed on the wall.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible area of the wall behind the armchairs shows a solid color, without any visible texture or color variation, suggesting a plain white surface. This choice is typical in modern interiors to create a neutral backdrop for furniture and decor.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a floor that shows reflections and a sheen characteristic of polished wood, indicating it has been finished to enhance its glossy appearance. This is typical for wooden floors that have been treated with varnish or polyurethane, common in residential interiors for aesthetics and durability.",
