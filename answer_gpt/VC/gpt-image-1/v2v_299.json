        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited airplane resembles a cartoonish and whimsical portrayal, complete with wings, engines, and a tail. These parts are distinctly visible, although they are altered to appear more playful and stylized compared to traditional aircraft design. This depiction is derived from the common design choices for animated or stylized vehicles, retaining key features for recognizability.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the airplane, despite its playful and cartoonish transformation, is clearly positioned on a runway. The visual cues, such as the runway markings and the alignment of the airplane on a flat surface, support this observation, consistent with the placement seen in typical airport settings.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a scene with a golden-hued sky, reminiscent of the warm tones of a sunset. This backdrop sets a similar mood to traditional sunset imagery, characterized by soft lighting and atmospheric glow, pointing towards a sunset ambiance similar to Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the runway markings, specifically the number '10' and the guiding lines around it, are prominently visible on the runway. These details are essential for runway identification and align with the common practices of airport runway markings, maintained from Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains a horizon line, albeit less pronounced due to the presence of lanterns and the cartoon-styled theme. However, the distant tree silhouettes seen in Image A are missing. The background does provide a vague continuation of the horizon, but the specific silhouette element is not retained in the edited version.",
