      "question": "Is the subject's arms-raised pose preserved in the chibi-style figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figure's arms are indeed raised. This is evident from the prominent position of the arms in an upward extended form, which reflects a welcoming or excited gesture. Commonly, such poses depict enthusiasm or excitement, fitting the context of a large meal, as also seen in Image A with the raised arms. Thus, the subject's pose is preserved in the chibi-style figure.",

      "question": "Are the multiple plates of burgers, fries, and drinks still present on the table in the same positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the plates of burgers, fries, and a drink are present, their positions may not entirely match Image A due to the chibi art style typically simplifying and rearranging elements for clarity and stylistic purposes. However, the elements are similarly and recognizably arranged to convey the same situation. Exact spatial matching is less critical in chibi representations.",

      "question": "Is the table still circular with a blue surface and metallic edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table depicted is a simplified representation akin to a circular form, common in chibi designs where simplification occurs. It retains a general blue color, suggesting the original table's surface, and the metallic edge is suggested through its distinct border, aligning with the styling cues from Image A.",

      "question": "Is the red booth surrounding the subject still visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a red booth surrounding the subject, primarily due to the focus being on the character and food on the table in chibi-style art. Chibi representations often eliminate complex background details to emphasize characters and key objects. Thus, the red booth is not visible.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style figure still display a cheerful facial expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi figures are designed to convey exaggerated and clear emotions, and in Image B, the facial expression of the chibi character appears intended to be cheerful. Although details are abstracted in chibi art, the general pose and context imply a cheerful demeanor consistent with the celebratory scene of a large meal. Thus, the figure's expression is intended to be cheerful.",
