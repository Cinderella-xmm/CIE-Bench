      "question": "Are the floral and foliate engraved patterns visible on the body of the transformed owl, arranged symmetrically between vertical ribs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanical owl features intricate floral and foliate patterns throughout its body, especially on its feathers. These patterns are ornate and offer a textured appearance, effectively contributing to its detailed design. However, they are not arranged symmetrically between vertical ribs as might be suggested if the owl had structured ribs similar to the vertical segments seen on some teapots.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the transformed owl retain a shiny, polished metallic surface consistent with the original teapot’s finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mechanical owl in Image B has a matte, dark metallic finish with detailed engravings and illuminated eyes, differing from the shiny polished look of a teapot's metallic surface visible in Image A.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the beak of the mechanical owl shaped like the original teapot’s curved spout, extending forward and slightly upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanical owl’s beak is quite different from a teapot's spout. It is short, triangular, and points directly forward rather than curving upward as is typical for a teapot's spout in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the tail of the mechanical owl follow the same graceful C-shaped curve as the original teapot’s handle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl's tail is depicted with a gentle curve but extends largely downwards, contrasting with the more pronounced C-shaped curve seen in the original teapot’s handle in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the crown-like head of the mechanical owl include a pointed, tiered finial matching the original teapot’s lid top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the owl with a head featuring a pointed, tiered finial reminiscent of the teapot's lid top in Image A, clearly aligning with the design elements observed in both images.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the body segments of the mechanical owl divided into vertical ribs, each housing a decorative motif, mirroring the original teapot’s structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mechanical owl in Image B displays continuous decorative patterns without clear vertical rib segmentation similar to the teapot structure of vertical ribs housing decorative motifs in Image A.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
