      "question": "Does the image retain the stark black-and-white contrast characteristic of the zebra's stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes continue to display a strong black-and-white contrast, which is a typical characteristic of zebras. This is evident from visually observing the edited image where the zebra's body has distinct white areas contrasted by dark stripes. Image A displays similar characteristics, with black-and-white stripes forming distinctive patterns across the zebra's body, contributing to its identity and recognition. Thus, the clarity and contrast of the stripes seen in Image B are maintained.",

      "question": "Is the zebra's mane still upright and striped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's mane is displayed as upright and maintains a striped pattern consistent with its body. This observation is based on the visual cues that show the mane having alternating black and white sections, resembling typical zebra characteristics. In Image A, the zebra also features an upright striped mane, affirming that this trait is carried over into the edited image. Therefore, Image B retains the upright and striped nature of the zebra's mane as found in Image A.",

      "question": "Are the zebra's ears still pointed and visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the zebra's ears as pointed and visible against the background. By analyzing the edited image, the zebra's ears maintain their structure, being distinct and protruding from the head. In Image A, the ears similarly appear pointed and visible, supporting the idea that the zebra's ears are presented consistently in both images. Thus, Image B still portrays the zebra's ears as pointed and visible.",

      "question": "Is the zebra depicted in a grazing posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of the zebra's head and neck suggests a grazing posture, as its head is lowered towards what would be the ground in a standard grazing stance. Image A reinforces this observation, showing the zebra with its head down in a grassy field, grazing. Therefore, Image B maintains this depiction of the zebra in a grazing posture, visibly similar to Image A.",

      "question": "Is the background still primarily composed of green grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the background is transformed into a black-and-white optical pattern distinct from a natural setting, without any presence of green grass. In Image A, the background is filled with green grass typical of natural habitat, which is not visually present in Image B. The stark difference signifies that the background composition in Image B has shifted from Image A's grassy landscape.",
