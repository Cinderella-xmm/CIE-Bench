      "question": "Is the golden-brown crust of the pie slice present with visible crumbly texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pie slice is illustrated with a relatively smooth and stylized crust that is typical of a cartoon depiction. Cartoons often use simplified forms and shapes without explicit texture detail to maintain clarity and focus. Based on these visual characteristics and the nature of illustrations, the crust does not feature a crumbly visible texture as seen in realistic portrayals like Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dark purple-blue berry filling with visible burst spots present in the pie slice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the berry filling on the pie slice appears as neatly arranged and uniformly shaped dark purple circles without any burst or uneven spots. This uniformity aligns with the illustrative style, where real-life details like burst spots are often omitted for clarity. In comparison with Image A, the filling in realistic photographs often have burst spots due to natural variations among berries.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is a single green mint leaf placed on top of the pie slice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the pie slice with two small stylized green leaves illustrated on top, rather than the single mint leaf visible in Image A. Illustrations might alter details for artistic purposes or simplicity. Hence, the representation in Image B is different from reality.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the pie slice served on a white circular ceramic plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the pie slice on what appears to be a white plate, but it is stylized and lacks specific material indications such as glossy reflections or characteristic edge patterns of ceramic. While Image A shows a more realistic ceramic plate, Image B's depiction is abstract and doesn't form conclusions about material specificity.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the tea mug visible with a handle on the right side and a tea bag string hanging over the rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tea mug is visible with a handle, but it is persistently drawn with two arms and a string-like detail hanging down. The cartoon style simplifies feature complexities, and elements like the string align with typical cartoon abstraction rather than realism. Image A offers realism, with complex visible features, possibly causing confusion without clear inferences in Image B.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the scene set on a smooth, matte gray tabletop surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is primarily warm-colored to complement the breakfast visual theme, likely not gray. Image A presents a more realistic gray tabletop surface, not applicable when comparing stylistic art in Image B, distinguished by prevalent background colors coherent against the artistic concept.",
