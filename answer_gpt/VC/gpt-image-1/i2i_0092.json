      "question": "Is the main subject of the new scene (seaside café elements) centrally positioned on the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main subjects on the table are a cup of coffee, a glass of water, and a small glass possibly containing sugar or another condiment. These elements are neatly arranged in the center of the table, creating a balanced and symmetrical composition. This central positioning is common in such setups to focus the viewer's attention on the elements being featured, which aligns with typical photographic composition practices.",

      "question": "Does the new scene retain a clean and minimalistic style with no extraneous objects or clutter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a clean and minimalistic composition, featuring just a cup, glass, and small jar on the table. The background is a serene view of the sea with sunlight reflections, and there is no excess clutter such as additional utensils, napkins, or decorations. This minimalism emphasizes tranquility and focus on the primary scene elements, fitting the aesthetic of a calm seaside café.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the perspective and composition of the new scene consistent with the original, providing a clear view of the seaside café tabletop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is taken from an angle that provides a clear view of the tabletop and its contents, showing the ocean in the background. The composition invites the viewer to experience the setting as if seated at the table, which would be consistent with a seaside café atmosphere. This consistent perspective ensures that the viewer can appreciate both the items on the table and the scenic view beyond.",

      "question": "Are there distinct sunlight reflections visible on the table surface in the new scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, distinct sunlight reflections are visible, especially on the left side of the table, influenced by the angle of the sunlight. This is evident in the glistening effect and the highlights seen on the surface of the table and also on the edges of the cups and glass, which is a common visual occurrence in direct sunlight scenes. This contributes to the overall bright and sunny atmosphere.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Can you see subtle sea wave reflections in the background or on the table surface in the new scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background clearly captures the sea and there are visible traces of shimmering light, which are reflections from the sunlight interacting with the sea waves. However, these reflections are primarily visible over the water and not notably on the tabletop itself. The depiction of the sea and its dynamic reflections adds realism and depth to the seaside setting.",
