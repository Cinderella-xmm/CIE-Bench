      "question": "Are the orange fields with black veins and white spots along the wing margins present in the butterfly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is depicted with orange wings that have black veins and what appear to be white spots along the wing margins, consistent with typical monarch butterfly patterns.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the butterfly’s forewings and hindwings in the illustration are drawn with white spots along the outer edges. This detail is consistent with known characteristics of a monarch butterfly, even though the art style is more whimsical.",

      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly illustration shows a black body with white speckles, matching the typical appearance of a monarch butterfly. Even with the cartoonish style, these features are depicted similarly to the real insect for identification purposes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is more whimsical and illustrative, focusing on anthropomorphized flowers and the interaction with the butterfly. The flowers have happy, smiling faces and do not exhibit a spiky central cone or drooping petals. This artistic choice steers away from realistic flora representation.",
      "weight": 2,

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the butterfly positioned directly above the flower, with its legs touching the bloom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is depicted as a conductor in an imaginative setting with animated flowers, which is quite different from realistic placement or positioning over a flower with its legs. The depiction is more of a thematic and symbolic interaction rather than a literal one.",
