        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a human hand with skin tones and creases visible.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird motif appears to be carefully placed in the central area of the palm. The placement is crucial for visibility and emphasis, which is a common artistic choice for objects or designs on the hand.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a background that appears plain and without any distinctive colors or distracting elements. A neutral background draws focus to the bird design on the palm, implying it remains unchanged in its neutrality and plainness.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B shows an intricately designed bird with flowing lines and details, deviating from the simple swallow-like shape visible in Image A. The swallow usually has a simple silhouette, whereas the edited image features ornate and exaggerated designs, suggesting deviation from the typical swallow shape.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fingers appear to maintain a slightly spread position, which is consistent with a natural and relaxed hand pose. The hand's position remains similar between the two images, providing the same aesthetic and spatial arrangement on both accounts.",
