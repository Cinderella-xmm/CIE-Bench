      "question": "Does the image retain the brown and white pattern characteristic of a giraffe on the nesting dolls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a set of nesting dolls shaped to resemble giraffes.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls display small protrusions on their heads, resembling ossicones, which are characteristic of giraffes.
