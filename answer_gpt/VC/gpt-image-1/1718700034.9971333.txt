    "Question": "Q1: Are the eyes blue and positioned symmetrically in the face, looking directly forward?",
    "explanation": "The face is blurred in Image B, eliminating any visual cues of eye color or positioning symmetry. Therefore, we cannot determine the characteristics of the eyes. Based solely on the analysis of visual cues in the edited image, the answer would be that there is no information available.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the nose small, rounded, and centrally located on the face, aligned with the eyes and mouth?",
    "explanation": "Similar to the previous question, the face in Image B is blurred, making it impossible to visually ascertain the nose's size, shape, or placement. Without visible features, it is indeterminable.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the mouth closed, with natural lips forming a gentle, neutral line centered beneath the nose?",
    "explanation": "The blurred face in Image B conceals the mouth region, thus providing no visual information about its state or positioning. Consequently, we cannot determine the nature of the lips.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the shirt white in color?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt appears to be a light beige or cream color rather than white. The visual cues indicate a contrast between the shirt and the wings, which are depicted in a semi-transparent, opalescent tone. Thus, the shirt does not match the description of being white.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the subject standing upright with arms relaxed at her sides and facing directly forward?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is indeed standing upright with what appears to be an outward and relaxed posture. Although the arms are not distinctly visible due to being slightly cut off, the overall visual cues suggest she is facing directly forward with an upright stance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the skin tone consistently fair and unblemished across the face and neck?",
    "explanation": "The face is blurred in Image B, preventing visual confirmation of skin tone or blemishes on the face region. However, the visible neck area seems fair and unblemished, typical for such depictions. Still, with no facial information, we cannot affirm consistency across face and neck.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the facial features symmetrically aligned along the vertical midline of the face?",
    "explanation": "Due to the blurred face, Image B offers no visible cues regarding alignment or symmetry of facial features, making it impossible to determine any details of facial structure or symmetry.",
    "answer": "No"
