      "question": "Are the pointed Gothic arches clearly visible within the stone towers of the bridge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bridge towers have taken the form of a giant stone-like creature, which lacks the architectural Gothic arches seen in traditional bridge designs. Instead, the creature's form is depicted with arm-like features, suggesting a transformation from an architectural structure to a humanoid form. This transformation does not include pointed Gothic arches. Thus, based on the visual cues in Image B, the typical architectural elements such as pointed Gothic arches are absent in the transformed version.",

      "question": "Is the American flag still present on top of the left tower of the bridge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, there is a large stone humanoid figure replacing the bridge structure, and on top of its head is an ice-crystal-like element rather than an American flag. As such, there is no American flag visible in Image B. Comparing with Image A, where the American flag is clearly present, the transformation of the tower into a stone figure in Image B does not retain this detail.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the bridge tower retain its original light gray sandstone texture with visible block patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bridge is transformed into a humanoid figure composed of stone. While there are stone textures present, they do not resemble the original light gray sandstone texture with block patterns evident in Image A. Instead, the stone texture in Image B is more uniform and fitting to the stone figure's anatomy, focusing on the natural rock-like appearance rather than architectural details. When compared with Image A, there is a significant change in texture and form.",

      "question": "Is the Freedom Tower positioned behind and slightly to the right of the bridge’s central axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background cityscape retains some elements of the original skyline, including the buildings positioned similar to their state in Image A. The Freedom Tower in Image A is visible behind the bridge and slightly to the right, a position that carries over to Image B despite the transformation of the bridge itself. Therefore, the Freedom Tower’s relative position remains similar between Image A and Image B.",

      "question": "Is there a reflective surface of water directly beneath the bridge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the focus is primarily on the transformation and does not depict a reflective surface of water beneath the construct. While Image A clearly shows water below the bridge, Image B omits these details, focusing instead on the stone figure and stylized background. Thus, the visible presence of water is absent in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the clouds in the sky distributed in a partly cloudy pattern with soft blue and white tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains a sky with blue tones and cloud elements. While the hues and distribution of clouds are not identical to Image A, the transformation retains the artistic representation of a sky with partly cloudy elements and blue tones, similar in essence to the partly cloudy pattern seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Do the surrounding skyscrapers retain visible grid patterns of windows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases skyscrapers in the background painted in a texturally artistic manner, maintaining structural likeness to typical city buildings with visible grid patterns. Similarly, Image A displays clear skyscrapers with recognizable window grids. Therefore, while artistic variation is present, the window grid patterns conceptually remain visible in Image B as they are consistent with urban building designs.",
