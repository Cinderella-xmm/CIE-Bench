      "question": "Is the white-framed window visible on the front face of the transformed structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on a fantastical creature replacing the chalet from Image A. This creature does not possess any windows since it resembles a bio-mechanical or mythical entity. The absence of a building structure also means no white-framed windows. In Image A, however, the chalet clearly has a white-framed window on its front face.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the small red structure located to the left of the main chalet still present in the transformed scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a landscape dominated by the fantastical creature, and there is no indication of any smaller structures like the small red building seen in Image A. The creature occupies a significant part of the mid-ground where the structures would have been.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the waterway flow from the bottom-right corner toward the center-left of the image, maintaining its original course?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waterway is visible and does appear to flow from the bottom-right corner towards the center-left. This suggests it maintains the original course similar to the one in Image A, which shows a stream flowing through the landscape in the described manner.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the large patch of snow located directly in front of the chalet still visible and positioned in the same place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A shows a large patch of snow directly in front of the chalet. In Image B, there is no visible patch of snow in a similar position. The focus on the creature and the altered landscape means the snow patch is not present or has been significantly altered.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are moss-covered rocks visible along the edges of the stream in the transformed scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are still elements resembling a natural landscape with watery edges that might have vegetation. Moss-covered rocks or similar textures appear along the edges of the stream, just like in Image A, which features identifiable moss on rocks near the waterway.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the transformed structure located in the mid-ground, slightly to the right of the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the large creature, which can be considered as the 'transformed structure'. This creature is located centrally in the mid-ground of the image and slightly to the right, aligning with the general location where the chalet was positioned in Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the mountain peaks visible in the background, with snow patches and mist covering their upper portions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the settings suggest mountainous terrain, the peaks themselves are not clearly discernible due to the low visibility and dense atmospheric conditions. Mist pervades the scene, but specific peaks with snow patches as seen in Image A are not distinctly illustrated. Thus, the clear visibility of mountain peaks covered in mist is not apparent.",
