    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the woman’s silver hair clearly visible and styled in a short, neat manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s hair is depicted in a simplistic silhouette style due to the papercut design, showing a neat bun rather than detailed individual strands or styling. This artistic representation only suggests a head shape rather than explicitly illustrating silver hair styled in any particular way.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both hands visibly holding the open book, with fingers wrapped around the edges of the pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the hands in a simplified manner as part of the papercut style, where the fingers are not individually detailed and appear as a singular shape holding the book. This lacks the complexity needed to show fingers wrapped around pages.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a tabby cat sitting on the red rug in the lower-right corner, facing upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "No pet is illustrated in Image B since it utilizes a stylized papercut design that primarily focuses on the woman and the surrounding books, omitting detailed objects such as the cat seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the armchair have a high backrest, padded arms, and visible wooden legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chair is represented in a basic silhouette form within the papercut art, suggesting the shape of a high-back chair but omitting details such as padding and wooden legs due to the art style's minimalist nature.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a stack of five books on the floor to the left of the chair, with a white mug resting on top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a bookshelf illustration without visible floor-level elements such as stacks of books or mugs. The papercut style focuses on overall composition without such specific objects related to physical space.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a white mug on the small wooden side table to the right of the woman?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's papercut style does not depict any small side tables or additional objects such as mugs. The art centers around the woman's figure in the chair along with surrounding shelves.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a beige knitted blanket with lace-like patterns draped over the woman’s lap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman in Image B is illustrated wearing a dress with lace-like patterns similar to a blanket's intricate design, consistent with the papercut's representation of textured clothing on her lap.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the woman seated upright with a slight forward lean, facing the viewer while reading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the woman in profile view, not facing the viewer directly. The artistic design shows her seated and reading, but not with a forward lean or viewer-facing positioning.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
