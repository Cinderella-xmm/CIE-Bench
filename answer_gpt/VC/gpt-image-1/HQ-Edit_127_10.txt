    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the intricate wrought-iron lattice structure of both Eiffel Towers?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the structure of the Eiffel Tower inside the snow globe appears in a stylized form designed for miniaturization, lacking the intricate detail found on the actual Eiffel Tower. The reduced complexity is common in miniature or decorative representations, where detailed elements are simplified due to scale limitations.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are both towers supported by a triangular base composed of four distinct pillars?",
    "explanation": "The tower inside the snow globe in the edited image does rest on a base that seems to mimic the general support structure of the Eiffel Tower, but because of the miniature style, it does not clearly display a triangular base with four distinct pillars as seen in the detailed real-world Eiffel Tower.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a clearly defined archway beneath each tower through which the path passes?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the depiction of the tower features an archway typical of the base design of the Eiffel Tower, but there is no path visually depicted passing through it, which differs from an outdoor scene where a navigable path may be present.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there exactly two Eiffel Towers present in the scene?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, there is only one Eiffel Tower visible inside the snow globe rather than two towers depicted as in the original outdoor setting. The design focuses on a singular representation due to the nature of a snow globe.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does each tower have a pointed spire at its apex?",
    "explanation": "The tower inside the snow globe in the edited image does feature a pointed top typical of the Eiffel Tower's design, maintaining the iconic silhouette of the structure with a pointed spire.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there three distinct horizontal platform levels visible along the height of each tower?",
    "explanation": "The tower inside the snow globe in the edited image is simplified due to its size, and thus it lacks the clear depiction of three distinct horizontal platform levels, which would be typical in a full-sized representation of the Eiffel Tower.",
    "answer": "No"
