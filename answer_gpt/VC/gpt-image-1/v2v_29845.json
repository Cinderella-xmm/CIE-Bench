      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image features the animal-like figure having long, upward-curving horns on its head.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the hybrid figure wearing a white lab coat on its upper body. The coat is detailed with lapels and pockets, and it extends down the body, suggesting typical full-length lab coat characteristics.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show brown trousers or black dress shoes on the lower half of the hybrid figure. Instead, the figure's lower half is covered with the fur similar to that of a cow, making it appear as a complete animal hybrid without human clothing on the legs.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hybrid figure does exhibit a forward walking posture similar to walking, but the legs are that of an animal rather than human form, and it's not specified if the right leg is lifted. The posture does imply movement similar to a bipedal stride.",
