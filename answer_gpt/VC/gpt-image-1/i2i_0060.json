      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of any elephant, baby or otherwise. Instead, the image shows a plate of food. This food presentation features a spiraled meat dish with various artistic garnishes, completely distinct from any elephants or their characteristics. Since there is no elephant or anything resembling an elephant's skin in Image B, it does not and cannot retain the baby elephant's features. Therefore, the answer is based purely on the absence of any elephant-related visual in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the baby elephant depicted with small ears compared to its body size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict any baby elephant or any form of animal life; it features a meticulously arranged gourmet dish with layers of meat and artistic garnishments. Given there is no representation of an elephant in this image, the concept of ear size, or any relative body size, does not apply.",

      "question": "Does the baby elephant retain a short trunk in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no elephant present; rather, a culinary dish with elaborate presentation is displayed. The image doesnâ€™t feature any animal characteristics, so attributes specific to elephants, like trunks, are not present. The absence of any recognizable creature negates any discussion of trunk size or presence.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B consists of a plate with food items and doesn't include any structural elements or any form of bars. The background and context of the image are solely focused on the food presentation without any architectural or enclosure features like the blue metal bars seen in Image A.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a white plate on a neutral surface, likely a table, featuring food. There is no evidence of any natural terrain or ground, including any form of dirt or soil. Image B's entire composition is centered on culinary art rather than a scene grounded in any earthly environment, let alone one covered with reddish dirt.",
