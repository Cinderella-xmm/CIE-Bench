    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are all leaf-shaped elements in the image, including those used as heads, clearly five-pointed maple leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf-shaped elements used as heads have a cartoonish design with distinct features. While they resemble maple leaves, they are simplified and stylized, emphasizing the face and body of the characters. Typically, maple leaves are characterized by their distinctive, serrated edges with multiple points, usually more than five. The cartoon nature makes it difficult to assert they are clearly five-pointed. Thus, the representation leans more towards a generic leaf shape rather than a precise five-pointed maple leaf.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are all leaf elements rendered exclusively in shades of orange, yellow, and red?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf-shaped characters are primarily depicted in shades of orange and yellow. The primary shades visible in their facial areas and other leaves include orange and yellow. These colors align with typical fall colors associated with maple leaves. There are no other color variations such as green or blue on these leaf elements throughout the image.",

      "question": "Is there a solid brown rectangular border surrounding the central illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a clear rectangular border encases the entire illustration, providing a distinct boundary between the content and the edge of the card. The color of this border appears to be brown, aligning with the question's descriptor. The border surrounds both the animated leaf characters and the speech bubbles they convey.",

      "question": "Is the background of the card uniformly white?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": " In Image B, the background of the card appears to be a pale, cream-like color, rather than a stark, bright white typical of a uniform white background. This gives the card a warmer tone, which complements the autumnal theme of the illustration. Therefore, it is not uniformly white as it deviates from pure white.",

      "question": "Is the central illustration positioned centrally within the card, bounded by the rectangular frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central illustration, which includes the cartoon leaves and text, is positioned centrally and bounded by the rectangular frame. The layout is balanced, with equitable space around the primary elements within the border. This central positioning ensures harmony and focus within the card.",
