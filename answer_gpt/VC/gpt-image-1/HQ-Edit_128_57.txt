    "Question": "Q1:Is the lion’s head medallion present at the center of the desk's front panel?",
    "explanation": "Based on the visual cues from Image B, the center of the desk's front panel features decorative patterns but does not distinctly show a lion’s head medallion. My world knowledge regarding decorative furniture suggests that such embellishments are often exquisite or symbolic additions on vintage furniture, yet in Image B, the usual visual indication of a lion's head shape isn't identifiable. Comparing Image A, where a lion's head medallion is distinctly visible, highlights this absence in Image B.",
