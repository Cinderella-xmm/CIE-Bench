      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the faces are blurred to anonymize the individuals, making it impossible to determine the shape of the eyes, pupils, or detailing such as eyeliner. Therefore, based on the visual information, I conclude that the eyes are not clearly visible.",
