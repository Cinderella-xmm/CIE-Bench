      "question": "Are the three sheep positioned near each other, with one adult sheep interacting closely with the two younger ones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, three chibi animals are positioned standing side by side, closely grouped together. Based on the visual cues, there are no noticeable interactions between one designated adult and the two younger ones as they are facing the same direction in a straightforward manner without suggesting a specific interaction or communication between any of the figures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the chibi sheep maintain their original postures, with the adult sheep standing upright and the younger ones leaning towards it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi animals are depicted in a cartoonish style, lined up next to each other. All three figures stand with a similar posture that doesn't demonstrate any leaning or distinctive posture differentiation between an adult and younger animals. Thus, within Image B, the design choice is consistent for all figures and does not reflect the described arrangement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the chibi sheep retain identifiable sheep-like body proportions, such as a rounded body and small legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates cartoon versions of sheep and goats that maintain characteristics typically associated with sheep-like body proportions, such as a rounded, fluffy body and small legs. These stylized figures uphold a universally recognizable sheep-like silhouette, despite their cartoonish exaggerations.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible interaction displayed between the adult chibi sheep and the two younger ones, suggesting care or attention?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, the chibi figures are positioned next to each other, standing uniformly. They face forward without any obvious gestures or postural adjustments that would imply interaction, care, or attention between them. The orientation is standard, lacking dynamics that would indicate a distinct connection or interaction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the chibi sheep retain a representation of their woolly texture, even in a stylized or simplified manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the sheep figure with a simplified design that reflects a woolly texture. The stylized representation, while minimalistic, uses a rounded and fluffy appearance that mimics the traditional fluffy texture common to sheep, indicating their woolly attribute even in the cartoon format.",
