      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the perfume bottle include a shade of pink that matches the \"Rose Pink\" eyeshadow in the original palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The perfume bottle in Image B is primarily a deep red with intricate leaf designs. There is no visible shade of pink that matches a typical 'Rose Pink'. Based on common shades and understanding of color palettes, 'Rose Pink' generally refers to a lighter, more pastel pink, which is not seen in the deep red bottle.",

      "question": "Is the text \"Anastasia Beverly Hills\" visible on the perfume bottle or its packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On examining the perfume bottle in Image B, the only visible text is the word 'ROSE' printed vertically on the bottle. There is no indication or visibility of the text 'Anastasia Beverly Hills' anywhere on the bottle or its external features.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the perfume bottle feature an external accent in the color \"Burnt Orange\" as seen in the palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color 'Burnt Orange' typically resembles a deep, earthy orange hue. The perfume bottle in Image B lacks such a color accent. The predominant colors are the red of the bottle and the gold of the rose cap, and neither corresponds to 'Burnt Orange'.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image of the perfume bottle in Image B is thoroughly examined, and the design exclusively features the perfume bottle with a rose top, without any visible makeup tools or accessories such as a dual-ended makeup brush.",

      "question": "Is the background of the image a soft pink gradient matching the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B of the perfume bottle is a neutral beige tone, which neither matches a soft pink gradient nor shares any pink hue that would typically be associated with the description from Image A. A pink gradient, especially a 'soft' one, would be more distinctly pink in hue.",
