      "question": "Does the Funko Pop figure retain the large hind legs characteristic of a kangaroo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Funko Pop figure (Image B) shows a stylized representation of a kangaroo. By observing the figure, it possesses larger hind legs compared to its front limbs, which is a distinctive characteristic of kangaroos, known for their powerful hind legs used for hopping. The design retains this aspect, albeit in a chibi or exaggerated style common in Funko Pops.",

      "question": "Is the long tail of the kangaroo preserved in the Funko Pop figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Funko Pop figure clearly has a long tail extending behind it. Kangaroos are known for their long, strong tails used for balance and support when moving. The tail is a prominent feature in this figure, indicating that this characteristic of the kangaroo is preserved in the design.",

      "question": "Does the chibi-style kangaroo figure inside the box include a pouch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting the chibi-style kangaroo figure inside the box in Image B, there is no visible pouch on the figure. Kangaroos typically have a pouch to carry their young, but in stylized or simplified designs, certain details like pouches may be omitted for simplicity.",

      "question": "Is the Funko Pop figure primarily colored brown to reflect the original kangaroo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Funko Pop figure in Image B is colored in different shades of brown, which are typical colors for a kangaroo's fur. This color choice aligns with the realistic depiction of a kangaroo seen in Image A. The brown color used indicates an attempt to reflect the natural fur color of kangaroos.",

      "question": "Are the hopping-related elements (hind legs and tail) depicted in the chibi-style figure inside the box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figure inside the box does display larger hind legs and a visible tail, both essential for the hopping movement characteristic of kangaroos. Despite the stylization, these features are highlighted and suggest an intention to reflect the kangaroo's ability to hop.",
