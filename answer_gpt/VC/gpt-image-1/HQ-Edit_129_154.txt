    "Question": "Q1: Are the floral and foliate engraved patterns visible on the body of the transformed owl, arranged symmetrically between vertical ribs?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanical owl features intricate floral and foliate patterns throughout its body, especially on its feathers. These patterns are ornate and offer a textured appearance, effectively contributing to its detailed design. However, they are not arranged symmetrically between vertical ribs as might be suggested if the owl had structured ribs similar to the vertical segments seen on some teapots.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the body segments of the mechanical owl divided into vertical ribs, each housing a decorative motif, mirroring the original teapot’s structure?",
