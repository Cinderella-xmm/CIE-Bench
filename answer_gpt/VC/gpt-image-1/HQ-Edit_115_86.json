      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ballerina's feet are adorned with pointe shoes which are visible and appear to be correctly positioned for ballet. The ribbons wrapped around the ankles are a typical feature of ballet pointe shoes, providing support and aesthetics.

      "question": "Is the ballerina wearing a tutu with a layered, flared skirt extending from the waist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the ballerina wearing a tutu, notable for its layered design and flared extension from the waist. Such tutus are common in ballet, often designed to be visually striking and consistent with ballet aesthetics. The artwork style presents the tutu with exaggerated features for artistic purposes, yet maintains the essential characteristics of a traditional ballet tutu.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the ballerina have her hair styled in a tight bun at the back of her head with straight bangs across her forehead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ballerina's hairstyle includes a tight bun at the back, often seen in ballet to keep hair neatly off the face during performance. The illustrations in the image consistently portray the bun; however, the inclusion of straight bangs is not evident, as the image stylizes the ballerina without visible bangs, focusing instead on a compact head-up style without fringe.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the ballerina standing en pointe with one leg slightly behind and bent, and the other leg supporting her weight in a balanced position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, the ballerina's pose suggests her standing in a ballet position, en pointe, with exaggerated stylistic elements typical of the chibi art style. However, it doesn't detail a specific ballet pose with one leg behind and bent while the other supports her weight. The illustrations emphasize standing posture and artistic depiction rather than specific ballet stance details.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the ballerina standing on a wooden floor composed of horizontal planks with visible grain and warm brown tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B primarily showcases a chibi-styled ballerina on a decorative background filled with pastel colors and floral motifs instead of realistically showing an environment, like a wooden floor. The artistic focus is more on thematic elements than a detailed recreation of a stage environment with wooden planks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the ballerina’s head tilted upward and turned toward the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized illustrations of the ballerinas do not exhibit a head tilt upward or any orientation toward the right side of the image. The positions captured tend to portray straightforward, classic ballet poses without explicit directional head tilt, remaining neutral in alignment with the focus on artistic presentation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B indeed shows tutus in a predominantly pink color palette, consistent with the stylization and thematic harmony of ballet attire. Subtle embellishments, such as glitter and decoration, complement this primary hue, illustrating a typical approach in ballet costume designs while adhering to the artistic illustration's character.",
