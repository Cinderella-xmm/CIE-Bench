      "question": "Is the golden-brown crust with visible charred edges present in the character's costume design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is dressed in a costume with a pizza theme. The hat and dress are both designed to mimic cheese pizza, with golden-orange and yellow hues. However, there are no visible charred or darkened edges that resemble the crust of a pizza, which is typically golden-brown with some charring at the edges. Thus, the character's costume does not include the detail of a charred crust.",

      "question": "Are there visible raised bubbles and browned patches on the cheese-like elements of the character’s costume?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the character’s costume seen in Image B, the cheese-like elements predominantly consist of a smooth and even pattern, lacking the visual detail of browned patches or raised bubbles that are usually seen on baked cheese. These elements are stylized in a simplistic, cartoonish fashion, so these specific characteristics are not present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the character’s body or head silhouette retain a triangular shape reminiscent of a pizza slice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the character's overall silhouette, especially the body, does not reflect a triangular shape. Both the head and the body are more rounded, as is typical for human or anthropomorphic designs, and they do not mimic the classic triangular shape of a pizza slice.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors of the character’s costume primarily golden-orange and yellow, matching the original pizza’s hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's costume predominantly utilizes golden-orange and yellow hues, capturing the color palette of cheese pizza. This color scheme is consistent throughout the character's attire, including the hat and dress, and closely resembles the coloration of fresh baked cheese on a pizza.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the cheese-like parts of the character’s costume show a textured surface with small raised bumps or ridges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The costume design in Image B presents a smooth and unified appearance for the cheese-like elements, without detailed surface textures like raised bumps or ridges that are often seen on melted or baked cheese. The depiction is more stylized to conform to a cartoon aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the character designed to represent a single pizza slice rather than a whole pizza or multiple slices?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character resembles a slice of pizza through the use of cheese-like colors and patterns in their attire, but it is not literally shaped like an individual pizza slice. The character's design focuses on a pizza aesthetic rather than representing a physical pizza slice. Therefore, the character is not directly representing a single pizza slice.",
