      "question": "Are the elephant's tusks present and curved outward in a natural arc, extending from the mouth and tapering toward the tips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's tusks are visible and show a natural outward curve, extending from the mouth and tapering to points. This appearance is consistent with real elephants, whose tusks naturally curve as they grow. There is no need to compare with Image A to establish this observation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the elephant's skin display deep, wrinkled folds across the forehead, neck, and body, consistent with natural elephant dermatology?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's skin is shown with some texture that suggests wrinkles, particularly around the forehead and neck. Although the depth of these wrinkles is less pronounced due to the small size of the model elephant, this is typical of an artistic representation aiming to depict realism. There's no direct comparison needed with Image A to answer this question.",

      "question": "Is the acacia tree present with a broad, flat canopy and extended horizontal branches above the elephant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the acacia tree is present inside the suitcase beside the elephant. However, the tree is smaller with a canopy that is not broad or flat like a real acacia tree would be. It is proportionately designed to fit within the suitcase diorama. This contrasts with Image A, where the acacia tree has a broad, flat canopy with extended branches.",

      "question": "Is the foreground covered in tall, golden-yellow grass blades that extend upward and show subtle motion from wind?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground appears to be lined with a texture designed to look like grass, but it's clearly a static material lining the suitcase rather than individual grass blades that might show motion from wind. In contrast, Image A shows a natural savannah landscape with tall grass. Therefore, the conditions described in the question apply to Image A but not to Image B.",

      "question": "Are snow-capped mountains visible in the background, forming a distant ridge line behind the elephant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background within the suitcase diorama shows a depiction of a sky with clouds but does not include snow-capped mountains. Conversely, Image A displays snow-capped mountains forming a ridgeline behind the elephant. The absence of such features in Image B leads to the conclusion that the criterion is not met.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the elephant's trunk curled at the tip and showing segmented ridges along its length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's trunk is depicted as straight with no discernible curling at the tip, and while there is texture to suggest segmentation, the segmented ridges typical of elephant trunks are understated due to the model's scale. Comparing this with Image A, the elephant there may have more pronounced features. Thus, the details described in the question do not apply thoroughly to Image B.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the elephant's ears have a large, broad, fan-shaped outline with visible internal folds and a downward flare?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's ears are modeled to appear broad and fan-shaped with slight indication of internal folds. However, the smaller scale of the model might reduce the visibility of certain detailed folds and flares that are prominent in real-life elephants. Image A, in comparison, could exhibit these features more prominently due to a larger scale and realistic depiction. Still, the basic shapes are in line with those described.",

      "question": "Is the lighting consistent with a source from the upper left, casting shadows on the right side of the elephant and grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting within the suitcase diorama suggests a generic even lighting or possibly a front-oriented source, with no clear shadows cast in accordance with a specific direction from the upper left. In a diorama involving artificial lighting, shadows are typically directed by design and may not align with those in a natural setting such as in Image A.",
