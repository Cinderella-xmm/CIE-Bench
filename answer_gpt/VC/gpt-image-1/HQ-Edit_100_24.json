      "question": "Is the dragon embroidery clearly visible on the left side of the chest, with detailed scales and a raised texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon embroidery on the dress is prominently visible.

      "question": "Are the peony and vine floral patterns visible along the right side of the dress, matching the original arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are floral patterns depicted on the dress. However, the patterns do not match the arrangement seen in Image A, where they were distinctly on the right side of the dress. Instead, Image B presents more generalized floral designs that deviate from the original arrangement. Using knowledge of the traditional dress patterns suggests variance.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face is blurred, making it impossible to discern any facial features such as the eyes, nose, or lips. This alteration prevents identification and comparison of facial features with Image A.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hands in Image B are shown in a position similar to Image A, resting gently on the waist area with fingers interlaced. This consistent portrayal indicates that the hand positioning is unchanged, providing a sense of elegance and poise typically associated with formal portraits.",
