    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the glass bulb shaped like a teardrop with visible internal filaments present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bulb is illustrated as a cartoon character and not as a realistic glass bulb. It has a humanoid depiction with eyes, mouth, and limbs, resembling a theatrical lightbulb representation rather than a functional one with internal filaments. The cartoon style and anthropomorphism suggest it does not have the true glass and filament attributes of a real light bulb.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the curved vertical bars forming a cage-like structure around the bulb present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bulb is illustrated with lines that mimic the cage-like structure found in typical industrial lamps, but they are more part of the stylized design rather than functional bars. They contribute to the aesthetic of a light bulb character rather than a realistic protective cage structure.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the dark cylindrical housing at the top of the fixture with a visible screw detail present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a cylindrical top that is part of the bulb's character design, reflecting a lamp fixture. However, due to the cartoonish nature of the illustration, detailed elements like visible screws are stylized or omitted for simplicity.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the circular cap at the bottom of the metal cage present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon representation does not explicitly show a detailed circular cap at the bottom. The focus is more on the anthropomorphic features of the bulb character and not the mechanical details found in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the glass bulb positioned centrally within the metal cage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon lightbulb's anthropomorphized design occupies the central space that would conventionally be filled by a real glass bulb within a cage. The bars around it further enforce this centered positioning within a stylized cage representation.",
