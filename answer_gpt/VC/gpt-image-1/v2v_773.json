      "question": "Is there a single dark brown seed visible in the center of the apple's cross-section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe a figure of an apple-like character with an animated, expressive face, holding a sword. The design does not include an apple with a natural cross-section where seeds are visible. The apple has been stylized into a character for the purpose of representing a fictional, creative pirate theme. Therefore, there is no realistic apple cross-section with a visible seed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the apple’s flesh show a dry, fibrous texture with visible vein-like patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apple-like character’s surface does indeed reflect a texture reminiscent of a dry, fibrous apple flesh with vein-like patterns. This is indicated by the texture details on the face of the character, which matches such a description, seemingly mimicking the characteristics seen in a matured or dried apple.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a dark brown stem attached to the top of the apple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character representation includes a dark brown stem-like feature at the top of the apple head. This is part of the design of the character, maintaining the aesthetic feature typical of an actual apple.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the apple sliced vertically, exposing a symmetrical cross-section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a stylized depiction of an apple character with a symmetrical face that resembles a vertically sliced apple. This design choice gives the impression of a symmetrical cross-section which is necessary for the stylization of the character.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the apple placed on a flat, light gray, matte surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict the apple on a surface. Instead, there is a character figure standing on what appears to be a round display base, typically used for figures. The figure itself, as well as the accompanying package, creates an environment for the character rather than showcasing it on a flat, light gray surface.",
