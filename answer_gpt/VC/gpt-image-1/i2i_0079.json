      "question": "Is the black drawer cabinet still present below the round mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a similar structure to a black drawer cabinet is clearly visible in the lower part, consisting of a six-drawer cabinet. Overlapping features such as the number, arrangement, and appearance of the drawers help confirm this structure as a drawer cabinet through common knowledge and observation. Thus, it can be deduced that the black drawer cabinet is still present.",

      "question": "Does the image still feature a large round mirror above the drawer cabinet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a large round shape situated directly above what is described as a black drawer cabinet. Based on common knowledge and visual cues, the round shape with its positioning and purpose behind the cabinet resembles a round mirror. Therefore, the image does still feature a large round mirror.",

      "question": "Is natural light still entering the room from the window on the left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not appear to show any window or significant source of natural light due to the lack of luminous areas or identifiable structures like window frames. Without relevant visual cues indicating natural light entry, it concludes that natural light is not present in this image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a small model representation, but there is no depiction of a potted plant or leaves next to the cabinet. The scene looks simplified, omitting elements like plants present in more comprehensive scenes. As such, there is no potted plant around the cabinet area in this simplified edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks visible floor areas displaying textures or patterns resembling wood. The underneath surface appears homogeneous with no distinctive texture indicative of wood. Consequently, a light wood texture is absent from Image B.",
