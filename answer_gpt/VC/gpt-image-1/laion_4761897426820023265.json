      "question": "Is the Great Wall depicted as a continuous, zigzagging structure following the contours of the mountain ridges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Great Wall is represented within a snow globe as a miniature structure that follows the ridges of hills within the globe. The wall is shown as a zigzagging path that aligns with the miniature landscape. This depiction aligns with the iconic and geographic nature of the Great Wall as it was designed to follow the natural terrain. Using world knowledge, it is understood that the Great Wall is known for its expansive and winding course across mountains. Therefore, the depiction in Image B reflects this characteristic.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the walls constructed with visible gray stone bricks and topped with crenellated battlements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a miniature version of the Great Wall within a snow globe. The miniature wall has a clear depiction with details, yet common snow globe design might not focus on realistic color rendition or intricate features like brick visibility or battlements. Instead, there might be simpler models for aesthetic appeal. The wall seems simplified for representation and may not explicitly detail gray stone bricks or crenellated battlements. Common perception when it comes to miniature items leans towards more solid and uniform colors for ease of crafting. Therefore, it can be inferred that these specific details are either absent or unrealistic.",

      "question": "Are there watchtowers visible at regular intervals along the wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a miniature representation of the Great Wall within a snow globe. In typical accuracy and design representation for such models, watchtowers might be strategically placed along the wall for realism. The model in Image B indeed features small structures that resemble watchtowers spaced at meaningful intervals along the wall, supporting the characteristic layout of the Great Wall, which includes several watchtowers or guard structures along its length.",

      "question": "Do the trees surrounding the wall display bright autumn colors, including yellow, orange, and red foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene within the snow globe presents a landscape surrounding the wall with vibrantly colored trees in various shades of autumnâ€”namely yellows, oranges, and reds. This ties closely to the typical autumn coloration of deciduous trees and enhances the visual appeal of the globe. The coloring provided in the globe indicates the trees are set in an autumn landscape, using commonly known fall colors to convey the season.",

      "question": "Is there a large, rounded rock formation embedded near the right side of the wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is the miniaturized version of the Great Wall within a snow globe. Due to the scale and stylized nature of snow globes, extraneous elements like rock formations are unlikely to be depicted unless they hold significant visual or thematic value in the model. The globe captures the essence and general features of the wall, but a rounded rock formation near the wall is not distinctly represented.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays small figures within the miniature landscape of the snow globe. These figures are placed along the path of the wall, resembling tourists or visitors. Some figures in Image B are indeed ascending miniature stairs and others are positioned standing, which aligns with common practice in staging snow globes that mirror typical human activity on the Great Wall.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature representation of the Great Wall has small figures interacting with elements of the model such as stairs. The snow globe design includes stone steps leading upward along the wall where figures are seen climbing, capturing an essential aspect of the Great Wall which features steps in many sections.",
