      "question": "Are the gorilla’s eyes golden-yellow in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image of the gorilla in Image B has a blurred region over the face, making it impossible to discern the color of the eyes. Thus, we cannot determine if the eyes are golden-yellow.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the gorilla has a crest or rounded shape on its head, but without distinct coloration details visible in the edited form, determining if it is silver-colored is not possible.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla is holding a banana bunch with multiple yellow bananas that curve outward, originating from a common stem. This visual is clear and aligns with the description.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the gorilla with both hands positioned around the banana bunch in a way that suggests they are actively holding it. This posture is indicative of grip and support for the bunch.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B portrays the gorilla as facing forward, the blurred section over the face makes it impossible to confirm direct eye contact with the viewer.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
