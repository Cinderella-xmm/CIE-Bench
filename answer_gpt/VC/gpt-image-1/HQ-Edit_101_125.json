      "question": "Are the round wire-rimmed spectacles present on the elderly gentleman's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area where the spectacles would be visible is clearly illustrated, and no round wire-rimmed spectacles are depicted on the elderly gentleman. By using world knowledge about drawing styles, especially in cartoon representations, spectacles are typically distinctly shown, and their absence here indicates that the gentleman is not wearing them.",
