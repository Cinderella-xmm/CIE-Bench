    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the subject's skin tone still dark brown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's skin tone is visible on the arms. The tone appears to be dark brown, consistent with natural African or African-American skin tones. This observation is made by recognizing the deep, rich color typical of such skin tones, confirming that the skin tone remains dark brown.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the subjectâ€™s head tilted upward with her gaze directed toward the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the face is blurred, the head position can still be assessed. The head appears to be in a neutral forward-facing position rather than tilted noticeably upward. Without clear upward tilt in the neck or a hint of skyward gaze in the body posture, we conclude the head is not tilted upward.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are both arms extended outward with hands open and palms facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the subject with both arms positioned outward, with hands open. The palms do face upwards or slightly forwards, which can be characteristic of an expression of openness or an angelic portrayal. This confirms the described pose accurately.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the subject have braided hair, even if stylized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hair is depicted in a textured, possibly braided style, consistent with the intricate designs often seen in such portrayals. This suggests the hair is indeed braided, maintaining a stylized effect.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lower portion of the garment flaring outward, suggesting motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The garment in Image B seems to have a draped appearance with flowing layers that suggest a sense of movement or dynamism. The way the fabric appears to swirl conveys that the lower portion is flaring outward, resembling motion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the subject smiling with visible teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the facial blur in Image B, determining specific expressions such as smiling or visible teeth is impossible. Without a clear facial view, it's impossible to accurately assert facial expressions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
