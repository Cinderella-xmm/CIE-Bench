      "question": "Is the metallic mask with horn-like protrusions at the temples present and retaining its original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a cartoonish illustration of horns at the temples. These horns are stylized and simplified compared to common horn designs in illustrations, which typically have more detailed features and realistic shapes. Without comparing Image A, the horns in Image B do not appear to retain a metallic texture or original shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red lips and visible lower face (including chin and jawline) clearly present and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's visual is cartoonish, with a simplified and stylized lower face and mouth area. It lacks the detail typically displayed in realistic art, suggesting changes in form from a detailed human representation to a stylized cartoon rendering. Therefore, based on Image B alone, they are not clearly present and unchanged compared to traditional illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the black hair styled in an updo with floral branches positioned symmetrically on both sides of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair is styled into an updo, which is a common traditional style, and floral branches are depicted symmetrically on both sides of the head, surrounding the hair in a balanced manner, typical of artistic renditions of such subjects. Given the symmetrical layout and clear styling, the components appear true to traditional depictions of headpieces.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are cherry blossom branches visibly integrated into the hair on both sides of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, branches featuring cherry blossoms are illustrated and positioned on both sides of the head, integrated into the hair with a stylized presentation that reflects traditional art elements. The branches are clear and predominant features in the composition, aligned with cultural representations of such accessories.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the subjectâ€™s facial skin tone fair and uniformly lit, matching the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a cartoonish rendering of the face without a clear, realistic depiction of facial skin tone or lighting. It is simplistic and uniformly patterned, typical of artistic renditions where realistic tones and lighting are often transformed due to stylistic changes. Consequently, the skin tone does not match a detailed or original depiction in realistic art.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the subject facing directly forward with a symmetrical pose and centered composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject appears to be facing directly forward with a symmetrical pose evident from the balanced composition of elements like the floral branches and the clothing design. This frontal orientation is frequent in stylized visuals where symmetry is intended as part of cultural artistry or design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the mask retain a textured, metallic surface appearance rather than becoming smooth or cartoonish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a simplified, cartoonish rendition of facial features with smooth lines and stylized shapes. This usually indicates a departure from detailed, realistic textures like metallic surfaces, which are often replaced with flat color areas in such art styles.",
