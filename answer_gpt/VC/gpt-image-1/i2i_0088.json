      "question": "Is the napkin still dark blue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the napkin appears to be a deep blue fabric, maintaining a rich color tone. The lighting and shadows provide consistency in the visual appearance of a dark blue hue. Thus, the napkin still presents as dark blue.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the napkin's fabric creases and texture preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a napkin with visible fabric creases and texture. These details suggest a continuation of the original textile nature, with folds and subtle lines indicating natural fabric behavior under lighting conditions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the new spoon occupy the same position on the napkin as the original fork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the spoon is positioned centrally on the napkin, akin to the layout observed with the fork in Image A. The alignment along the middle of the napkin suggests consistency in placement between the two utensils.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background still a solid dark blue tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background surrounding the napkin maintains a uniform dark blue shade, without variation or introduction of differing colors or patterns. The backdrop appears consistent in tone, supporting the reading of a solid dark blue background.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shadows and lighting on the spoon and napkin consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting and shadow effects observed on the spoon and napkin in Image B align with those in Image A, where lighting comes from an overhead source, creating natural highlights and shadows on the metallic surface and fabric respectively. These elements suggest a preserved and consistent lighting environment.",
