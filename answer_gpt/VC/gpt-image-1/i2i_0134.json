    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there visible steam rising from the broccoli/tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, steam is visibly rising from the broccoli. This visual cue is easily identified by the wispy, white, translucent lines ascending from the top of the broccoli. This steam effect is common in photography to suggest that the item is warm or recently cooked.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the broccoli/tree rest on a white plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the broccoli appears to be standing upright on a rich, green forest floor with moss and foliage, suggesting it is set in nature rather than on a plate. No white surface underneath the broccoli is visible, indicating that it is not on a white plate.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the broccoli/tree primarily green in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The broccoli/tree in Image B is predominantly green, which matches the typical color of broccoli. The visual information shows the broccoli in a vibrant green color, which is consistent with its natural appearance.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the characteristic florets of the broccoli discernible on the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) clearly shows the well-defined florets of the broccoli, which are visually distinct and typical of broccoli heads. These small, tightly packed green buds are characteristic of broccoli florets.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the broccoli/tree have a defined stem-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the broccoli/tree has a prominent, thick, stem-like structure at its base, supporting the florets, which is typical for broccoli. This makes it appear as if it is growing upright like a tree.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
