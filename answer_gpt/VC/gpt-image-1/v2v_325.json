      "question": "Is the blue car in the upper left position still rendered in blue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a representation of a blue car on the cereal box and as a toy car adjacent to it. While this does not directly replicate the real-world orientation of Image A, the color is still blue, consistent with the original car. By observing the toy cars which match the positions in the cereal box design, we can confirm the car related is presented as blue in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the red car in the upper middle position retain the compact sedan body shape with a sloped roofline and four doors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red car is depicted on the cereal box and as a toy with a more cartoonish style, showing animated features which abstract the design into a playful, exaggerated form with eyes and a smile. This abstraction alters the shape to a larger degree, focusing more on appeal rather than the realistic body style seen in Image A. Hence, it does not retain the compact sedan style as precisely detailed in Image A.",

      "question": "Are there exactly eight cars depicted in the final image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In examining Image B, there are four toy cars depicted in front of a cereal box. The box features designs of cars, but not all positions are matched with actual toy representations or drawings surfacing as independent vehicles in the image. Given this, the number of distinct car representations is less than eight.",

      "question": "Is the yellow car located in the upper middle-right position still yellow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a yellow toy car visible with pronounced animated features. We connect this toy to the position analogous to that in Image A, albeit the setting and perspectives differ. The retention of yellow coloring and its position as perceived on the box art justifies the color consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does each car have four wheels, with two at the front and two at the rear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features toy cars which, consistent with their animated nature, seemingly have two visible wheels from the angle displayed. Toys and illustrations often simplify designs for aesthetic purposes. The traditional configuration typical of cars, consisting of a pair of wheels on each side, cannot be accurately discerned for each toy car based strictly on the showcased perspective.",

      "question": "Is the red car in the lower right position still red and retains the compact sedan shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower-right red toy car resembles a lighthearted, stylized vehicle with distinctive playful features. These features deviate from the realistic counterpart in Image A, resulting in a loss of the compact sedan's definitive shape. Although the color red is maintained, the compact sedan design detail isn't preserved accurately.",
