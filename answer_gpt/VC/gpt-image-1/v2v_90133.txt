    "Question": "Q1: Is the background a uniform beige color without any gradient, pattern, or texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to be a uniform beige color. There are no visible gradients, patterns, or textures. This observation suggests the background was designed to be a plain, uniform color without any additional design elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the background have no visible texture, grain, or surface variation?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a smooth and consistent background with no apparent texture, grain, or surface variations. The uniformity of the color helps confirm the absence of such features.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there no shadows, reflections, or light variations on the background surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background maintains a consistent color with no visible shadows, reflections, or variations in lighting. The evenness of the color indicates that there are no such disruptions present.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the image framed with straight edges and no border or crop distortion?",
    "explanation": "Image B is presented with straight edges, and there is no indication of border or crop distortion. This is typical for digital images without manual framing issues.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the lighting on the background evenly distributed with no hotspots or directional shadows?",
    "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is evenly distributed across the background, as evidenced by the uniform color and lack of bright spots or shadows. This suggests a controlled lighting environment was used to achieve this effect.",
    "answer": "Yes"
