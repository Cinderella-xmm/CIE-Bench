    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the conical, tiered structure composed of multiple horizontal levels stacked vertically preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no presence of a conical, tiered structure composed of multiple horizontal levels stacked vertically, as depicted in the original Image A. Image B features a flat tree-shaped structure resembling the outline of a Christmas tree, indicating that the conical tiered design is not retained.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the teardrop-shaped chocolate droplets positioned at the center of each tier preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows several teardrop-shaped compartments filled with nuts, but these are part of a flat design that lacks tiers, unlike Image A where the teardrop-shaped chocolate droplets are at the center of each tier in a three-dimensional tiered structure.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the chocolate pinecone-like structures supporting each tier preserved in their original form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain chocolate pinecone-like structures that would support tiers, as the flat tree shape doesn't necessitate structural support provided by pinecone-like elements found in the three-dimensional tiered design of Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the nuts (including almonds, pecans, and hazelnuts) visibly contained within the teardrop-shaped droplets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, teardrop-shaped compartments within the flat tree outline visibly contain nuts such as almonds and pistachios, demonstrating that they are visibly contained similarly to how they are showcased in the teardrop-shaped elements of the original Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wide, circular base with a horizontal band at its edge preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no feature resembling the wide, circular base with a horizontal band at its edge that is present in Image A. The structure in Image B is flat, shaped like a tree, indicating the circular base is not preserved.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the overall color scheme dominated by deep brown tones with gold highlights preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B primarily consists of a deep brown tone with gold highlights, consistent with the color scheme of Image A. Both images reflect a similar color palette, indicating that the color scheme is preserved.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the teardrop-shaped droplets centrally aligned along the vertical axis of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teardrop-shaped compartments are centrally aligned along the vertical axis of the flat tree shape, akin to the arrangement in Image A, where teardrop-shaped droplets align centrally along the vertical axis of a tiered structure.",
