      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboarder is depicted as a chibi-style figure, which includes simplified and exaggerated features. The figure wears a black shirt.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style skateboarder is wearing blue jeans. This is indicated by the color and design of the pants in the edited figure, which mimics the typical depiction of jeans in a simplified, cartoonish styling.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the chibi figure on a skateboard with the position of the skateboard in relation to the chibi figure appearing upright, similar to the act of skateboarding. The skateboard is positioned beneath the figure as expected in a skateboarding pose.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pose in Image B, although simplified in a chibi style, is dynamic in nature, capturing the essence of movement. The arms are positioned in a playful manner and while it doesn't fully replicate the dynamic motion of Image A, it suggests an action-oriented stance typical of a skateboarding activity.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the skateboarder in a chibi style, which inherently lacks detailed textures. This style focuses on simplicity, using flat colors and simplified forms, hence it does not retain the detailed textures from Image A. The attire and skateboard are portrayed without intricate detailing.",
