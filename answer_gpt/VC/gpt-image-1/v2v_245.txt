    "Question": "Q1: Are the two jet engines mounted under the wings of the airplane present and correctly positioned?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the airplane is depicted as a toy model with one small engine under each wing. Compared to a realistic airplane, these are simplified representations but visually positioned under the wings. Given it is a toy, the positioning appears correct within the context of a toy design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the continuous row of oval-shaped passenger windows visible along the side of the fuselage?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the toy airplane features a few painted-on windows that mimic passenger windows on a real aircraft. Although they are not continuous as in full-scale airplanes, they are represented in this toy form appropriately for its scale.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the rounded nose cone with the three-part cockpit window configuration present at the front of the airplane?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the toy airplane exhibits a cartoonish rounded nose with two or three simplified cockpit windows. These windows are stylized elements common in toy designs, suitable to evoke the appearance of real airplane cockpits.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the tall vertical stabilizer (tail fin) present at the rear of the airplane?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the toy airplane with a stylized, exaggerated vertical stabilizer at the back, representing the tail fin. Its presence is consistent with both toy models and real airplanes, though simplified for the toy design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the landing gear assemblies with multiple wheels visible beneath the fuselage and wings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the toy airplane does not show any landing gear assemblies under the fuselage or wings. Toy models often omit such detailed structures for simplicity or design purposes.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the main wing structure extending from the fuselage with engines mounted underneath?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the toy airplane has main wings with engines situated below them. While these wings and engines are simplified, they maintain the positioning consistent with traditional airplane design, albeit in toy form.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the three cockpit windows arranged in a horizontal line at the front of the airplane?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the toy airplane features a simplified cockpit window arrangement, which appears to mimic the real cockpit design with multiple windows, though possibly reduced in number due to its toy nature. The horizontal line appearance is maintained.",
    "answer": "Yes"
