      "question": "Is the horseshoe-shaped grille with central mesh present on the front of the car and on the robot’s face/torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car prominently displays a horseshoe-shaped grille with a central mesh on its front, and this design element is mirrored on the robot's torso, resembling an emblem or face feature. Using world knowledge, the grille is a recognizable feature of certain luxury car designs, often replicated in the robot’s design to signify brand continuity in toy models. Since both elements are clearly visible in Image B, the observable presence of this feature on both car and robot is confirmed.",

      "question": "Are the side panels, front bumper, and door sections red, and the roof, hood, and lower body black?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the car's body color scheme includes red side panels, front bumper, and doors, with black coloring on the roof, hood, and lower parts. This is a classic two-tone style that highlights different sections of a vehicle, often used in sports car design to create visual contrast. The image clearly displays these coloring features.",

      "question": "Do both the car and robot feature five-spoke silver wheels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car visibly has five-spoke silver wheels, which is a common wheel design seen in many cars. However, the robot, while matching in color scheme and design language, does not distinctly feature such wheels visible on its parts like legs or arms, as the focus is more on circular elements representing joints or gears rather than traditional car wheels specifically shaped in a five-spoke design. Therefore, the absence of five-spoke wheels on the robot means they don't both feature this element.",

      "question": "Does the robot have gold-colored segmented armor plates on its chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's chest area does not display gold-colored segmented armor plates. Instead, the robot bears a design with black and red elements consistent with the car's scheme but lacks any distinctly colored gold segments, which might represent armored plating. The common motif is metal and toy-like elements, corresponding to a robotic design but not specifically in gold.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the robot’s arms formed from the car’s doors and fenders, and its legs from the car’s wheels and undercarriage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a robot where the arm sections are visually connected with a red seeming reflective of the car's door coloring, though not explicitly stating it forms directly from doors. Likewise, there's no visible direct formation or transformation of legs from car wheels or undercarriage. While it mimics a transformer-like conversion, the packaging and depiction do not illustrate a literal transformation. The design serves more aesthetic replication rather than mechanical transformation seen in transformer toys.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the car positioned in front of the robot, with the robot standing upright behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging design presents both the car and the robot but does not depict them physically aligned such that the robot stands upright behind the car. Both elements sit side by side within the given boxed design without any noted positional context of one being behind another. This divergence from an out-of-box display means the spatial arrangement described does not exist in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there white stripes on the front bumper and side panels of the car, and on the robot’s shoulders and face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car and robot model do not display white stripes on their respective parts such as the front bumper, side panels, shoulders, or face. The design focuses on a black and red theme, void of any distinctive white detailing that would stand out as stripes on these specific locations. This aesthetic choice keeps the models unified in color theme.",
