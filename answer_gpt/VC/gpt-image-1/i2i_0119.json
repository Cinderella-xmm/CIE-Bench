      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain features a character that has a predominantly yellow color scheme. This is evident from the uniform yellow coloration of the character's body, head, and arms, consistent with its depiction as a duck-like creature. The yellow color is a significant and identifiable feature, which is maintained in the keychain version.",

      "question": "Does the keychain version retain the large, flat duck-like bill?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain character possesses a distinctive large, flat bill which is visually similar to that of a duck. This feature is clearly presented on the character's face, retaining its original characteristic that contributes to the overall duck-like appearance. This suggests the keychain version has preserved the prominent bill feature.",

      "question": "Does the keychain version retain the wide-eyed expression and puzzled look?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the keychain character with large, circular eyes set in a manner that gives off a wide-eyed and slightly puzzled appearance. The eyes are open wide, and the character appears to be holding its head, which emphasizes the puzzled expression. This suggests that the keychain version has maintained the wide-eyed expression and puzzled look.",

      "question": "Are the small triangular ears still visible on the keychain version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain character lacks any visible small triangular ears. Instead, the character's features focus on its large, duck-like bill and wide eyes. The absence of ears in the visual depiction indicates that this characteristic is not present in the keychain version.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain character exhibits a rounded and compact form. Its body and head are smooth and rounded, contributing to a generally spherical silhouette typical of the creature. This indicates that the keychain version maintains the rounded shape.",
