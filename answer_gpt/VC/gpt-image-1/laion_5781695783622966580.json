        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat is visually wider than the one in Image A. It features a broad and outward-facing brim, resembling a hat with an artistic, exaggerated wide brim.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair maintains its wavy texture and appears to be the same shade of light brown as seen in Image A. Visual cues such as color consistency and hair styling affirm this recognition.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat has a distinct rounded crown with a consistent height in proportion to the wide brim. The visual symmetry and smooth curvature indicate a well-defined hat structure, consistent across its design.",
