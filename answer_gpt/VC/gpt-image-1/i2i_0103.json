      "question": "Is the central positioning and rectangular shape of the light blue sofa retained in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main features of the blue sofa, including its central placement within the room and its distinct rectangular shape, are preserved. The swirling patterns around the sofa do not obscure its basic shape or position. This suggests that the artist aimed to maintain these key elements while transforming the texture and appearance into a painterly style. In comparison, Image A also shows the sofa centrally positioned and rectangular, confirming consistency in both shape and location.",

      "question": "Is the framed landscape painting above the sofa still present in its original rectangular proportions and central alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a framed painting above the sofa that retains its rectangular proportions and appears centrally aligned above the sofa, similarly to Image A. The frames of both images match, and their central placement indicates that the artist kept these structural elements intact while modifying styles.",

      "question": "Are the large green leaves of the plant on the left side of the sofa preserved in terms of shape and location?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plant on the left side of the sofa is transformed using a painterly style, but the large green leaves are still recognizable in their original shape and location compared to Image A. The location next to the sofa is consistent, indicating the leaves and plant pot were retained amidst stylistic changes.",

      "question": "Is the blue-based lamp with the white shade positioned on the table to the right of the sofa preserved in terms of shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lamp on the table to the right of the sofa is painted with swirling colors but is identifiable by its similar blue base and the location next to the sofa, although its exact shape is more abstract. Image A showcases the lamp with clear shape and position, while Image B retains the position but alters the style considerably, maintaining the base idea of a lamp in that location.",

      "question": "Is the presence of the light-colored rug beneath the sofa retained in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area beneath the sofa exhibits swirling patterns in similar blue and yellow hues, suggesting a transformation of the rug into a painterly style. It does not distinctly show a light-colored rug, unlike Image A, where a tangible light rug is clearly visible, indicating this feature was not preserved in the edited representation.",
