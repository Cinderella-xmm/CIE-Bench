      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes of the figurine dark brown in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the material and visual depiction make it challenging to distinctly identify eye color, as it blends with the monochromatic texture of vanilla/off-white coloring. Therefore, it is not accurate to describe the eyes as dark brown based purely on visual cues in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the nose of the figurine black and oval-shaped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nose is not visible due to the blurred area covering the entire face region. Without a visible nose element, it's impossible to determine its color or shape.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the figurine retain the white, curly fur in a poodle-style grooming pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a figure with white, curly hair resembling a popular poodle-style groomed fur. The depiction in Image B showcases a similar hairstyle sans detailed color shifts, maintaining the visual portrayal of poodle-styled hair.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there large, layered pink ruffles on both sides of the figurineâ€™s dress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dress in a sculpted depiction where the material is monochromatic, integral to the carved design, eliminating color distinctions like pink. The ruffles are present but lack any pink hue.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a detailed silver brooch located at the center of the chest area of the dress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, due to its sculptural nature, lacks any color distinctions. There is no visible silver brooch; the surface detailing is uniform in the presented style.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the figurine in a side profile pose with the head turned slightly forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B is positioned facing forward, suggesting a straightforward display within the arch, as opposed to any side profile or turning.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the dress maintain a pastel color scheme with light blue and pink hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the dress in an intricately carved form, stripped of all color attributes, resulting in an overall vanilla/off-white appearance instead of pastel hues.",
