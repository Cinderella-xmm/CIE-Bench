        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show a dog figure with a large head and expressive eyes, positioned in a pose that suggests a playful interaction with a tennis ball.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis ball is visibly green with a prominent pink stripe, maintaining its distinctive look and color scheme.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the dog figure with oversized eyes directed towards the tennis ball, positioned in a way that suggests a playful interaction or observation.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The posture of the dog in Image B, with its body low and head directed towards the ball, conveys an intention of play or attention to the ball. Despite being a stylized rendition, the depiction retains the essential body language cues of a dog's focus on an object of interest, reinforcing the impression of a playful, engaged stance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tennis ball in Image B is rendered in a smooth, uniform color with no visible texture detailing typical of felt. The ball's appearance has been stylized to match the overall aesthetic of the cartoon-like design, which does not feature any textural elements that would suggest a felt-like surface. Thus, in this simplified artistic representation, the texture is not present.",
