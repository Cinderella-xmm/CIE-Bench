      "question": "Does the edited image retain the swirling vortex texture in the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is dominated by swirling patterns and vortex-like shapes, characteristic of Van Gogh's 'The Starry Night.' This texture appears visually similar to the original and retains the dynamic swirls that are iconic to the piece. Thus, the edited image maintains this signature swirling vortex texture.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tall, dark cypress tree that is originally located on the left side of the image in Van Gogh's painting remains present. The shape and texture of the tree, with its upward-reaching branches, remain consistent with the original.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both the original image and Image B, a village with distinct structures and a prominent church steeple is visible. The layout and position of the village, central within the composition of the image, appear to remain unchanged.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background of the composition features rolling hills, which are characterized by the undulating shapes and thick brushstrokes familiar from the original image. These hills add depth and dimension to the landscape and are an integral aspect of the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image retain the original blue and yellow color palette and thick brushstroke texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a color palette dominated by blues and yellows, mirroring the original painting. The brushstroke texture is also thick and distinct, maintaining the impressionistic and textured quality of Van Gogh's style. The addition of the squirrel does not alter the base palette and texture of the background.",
