      "question": "Is the ornate embossed pattern on the typewriter’s base clearly visible and preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the typewriter is depicted in a stylized manner, more akin to a vintage illustration rather than a photographic representation. While the artistic design of the typewriter maintains a sense of ornate detailing, the specifics of the embossed pattern are more simplified and illustrative due to the graphic style. This means that while there is detailing present, it is not as explicitly and clearly visible as it would be in a more realistic depiction.",

      "question": "Are the cylindrical metal keys arranged in a QWERTY layout with visible spacing and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the typewriter is illustrated, and while the keys are depicted in a manner reminiscent of vintage typewriters, the arrangement and individual detailing, such as spacing and depth, appear less precise and more stylized. The overall artistic portrayal does not emphasize realistic detailing, hence the clarity and specificity of a QWERTY layout with visible spacing and depth are not present.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a blank sheet of paper inserted into the typewriter’s roller mechanism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the typewriter is part of an artistic illustration where instead of a realistic depiction with a blank sheet, there is a stylized emanation or design element emerging from the typewriter. This artistic flourish replaces any realistic representation of a blank sheet of paper.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the ceramic mug with a visible logo or design present on the desk to the left of the typewriter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a graphical representation, where a ceramic mug can be seen on the left of the typewriter. However, due to the stylized, illustrative style of the image, the detailing is minimal, and no specific logo or design is explicitly visible on the mug.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the table lamp with a beige fabric shade and classical columnar base positioned to the left of the typewriter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a table lamp is indeed depicted to the left of the typewriter. The illustration maintains an old-fashioned sentiment, but due to the nature of the artwork, the specifics of the lampshade's material and the base's classical design are less explicit and detailed compared to a realistic depiction.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the wooden desk surface with natural wood grain and light reflection clearly visible beneath the typewriter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the desk surface is illustrated in a stylized manner, coherent with the vintage look of the entire illustration. While the artistic rendering includes conceptual representation of a desk, the specific details such as natural wood grain and light reflection are not as distinctly elaborated due to the style of the graphic.",
      "weight": 1,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several framed artworks are part of the overall background illustration. However, due to the artistic and less detailed nature of the illustration, the specific content such as a detailed landscape painting with a winding road and green hills is not clearly delineated.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, behind the typewriter, a round element resembling a clock is present. However, due to the artistic style, which tends towards stylization over realism, the specifics such as visible hour markers and hands are not distinctly illustrated.",
