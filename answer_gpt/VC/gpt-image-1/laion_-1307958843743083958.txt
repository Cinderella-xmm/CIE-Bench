    "Question": "Q1: Are the cheetahs in a seated position with bent hind legs, tucked tails, and upright front paws?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetahs are identified as gold figurines designed like perfume bottles, with a streamlined shape that does not clearly indicate specific bent hind legs or tucked tails. Instead, they appear smooth and stylized, not showing detailed limb positions. The common knowledge from the sleek shapes indicates a modern interpretation rather than a realistic stance. In Image A, the cheetahs exhibit clear seating posture with bent legs and tucked tails, which contrasts with Image B's design.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the head of each cheetah turned slightly to the side, away from the central divider?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, each cheetah's head is indeed turned slightly away from the center, as seen in their angled muzzle facing outward, indicating a consistent design choice to have the cheetah heads turned. Image A also shows outward-turned cheetah heads, confirming consistency across both images.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does each cheetah rest on a two-tiered base with a black upper section and a bronze-colored stepped lower section?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetahs are positioned on a black base with 'SAVANNA ESSENCE' written on it, and there is no apparent bronze-colored or stepped lower section. Image A shows a black and bronze stepped base. The base in Image B does not follow the two-tiered characteristic.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the cheetah figures positioned symmetrically, one on the left and one on the right, equidistant from the center?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of the figures is symmetrical: the cheetahs are placed equidistantly from the central vertical element, suggesting a deliberate and balanced design, consistent with common practice in product display. Image A also presents a symmetrical layout, reflecting balance in both images.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there exactly three vertical panels positioned between the cheetahs, with two narrower ones flanking a wider central one?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a singular central vertical element dividing the cheetahs. The design does not depict three distinct panels or any variance in width. Image A has visible separation with design patterns suggesting multiple panels, but Image B maintains a singular look.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the tail of each cheetah curve upward and rest on the base behind the body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the design is minimalist, and the cheetah figures do not distinctly show tails due to their sleek perfume bottle shape. Traditional cheetah tail placement, as seen in Image A where tails curve and rest on the base, is not present in Image B's stylized version.",
    "answer": "No"
