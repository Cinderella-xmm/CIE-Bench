      "question": "Does the edited image retain the deep, blocky lug pattern of the tire treads?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) features a robotic armadillo-like creature composed of metal and rubber elements. Its body parts, specifically the shell elements and limb coverings, have the deep, blocky lug pattern reminiscent of tire treads. This pattern resembles that typically found on off-road or rugged vehicle tires, designed for traction. Hence, the deep, blocky lug pattern of the tire treads is retained in this edited image in a stylized form.",

      "question": "Is the embossed text \"ROCKS TIRE\" and \"SUPER SWAMPER\" visible on the sidewalls of the tires?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the focus is on the creative depiction of a mechanical creature. There are no traditional tire sidewalls visible with embossed text. The elements resembling tire features do not include such specific text details as 'ROCKS TIRE' and 'SUPER SWAMPER' visible in the original tires from Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the mechanical creature does not have visible wheel hubs or any spoke designs. The design focuses on mechanical features mimicking an armadillo, without integrating the specific five-spoke wheel hub design present in the original image (Image A). As such, the five-spoke designs are not present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) portrays a creature with a hard metallic appearance, rather than the matte, rubber-textured surface found on tires. The texture present on the body parts of the creature is metallic and structured, matching the aesthetic of a robotic design rather than rubber texture.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the tread blocks have been creatively reimagined as part of a mechanical armadillo-like design, where they conform to the contours of the creature's body rather than a tire's circular shape. The spacing and proportions are adapted to fit the artistic representation, which differs from the proportional consistency of tire treads in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) does not depict four tires as in the original stack (Image A). Instead, it illustrates a single robotic creature. There are no individual tires or a stack of them visible within the edited design.",
