    "Question": "Q5: Is the player holding a black baseball bat with both hands?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character is shown with a black baseball bat, which is a common aesthetic choice in animated portrayals to create clear visual separation between the character and the equipment.

    "answer": "No"
}

    "explanation": "In Image B, a white baseball with red stitching is indeed shown approaching the character.

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the player in a crouched batting stance with knees bent and torso twisted forward?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted in a playful rather than a realistic stance due to the chibi style. While the character is in motion and adopting an athletic pose, it's more about emphasizing movement and action through the portal rather than adopting a detailed, realistic crouched batting stance.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Are both hands gripping the bat near the handle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, because the character is a chibi-style portrayal, the bat appears to be held in a non-traditional way due to the exaggerated nature of the representation and the dynamic scene, unlike in realistic depictions. Therefore, it doesn't show a grip near the handle with both hands traditionally.",
    "answer": "No"
