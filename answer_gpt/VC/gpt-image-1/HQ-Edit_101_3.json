      "question": "Is the bird rendered in a vibrant yellow color matching the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is illustrated with a bright, vibrant yellow color. This is evident from the uniformity and saturation of yellow on the bird’s body. By comparing with Image A, the bird in Image A also features a vibrant yellow plumage. Thus, Image B maintains the same vibrant yellow color as observed in the original Image A.",

      "question": "Are there distinct black stripes visible on the bird’s wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird has clear black stripes on its wings. These stripes are depicted as sharp, dark lines against the yellow wings, providing a contrast that defines them distinctly. In Image A, the bird similarly has distinct black markings on its wings, thus confirming that Image B accurately represents this feature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the bird have a clearly defined round black eye?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bird with a distinctly outlined black round eye. This stylized illustration emphasizes its roundness and blackness, typical of simplistic or animated styles. In Image A, the bird's eye is also black and prominently round, reinforcing the observation that the eye's representation is consistent across both images.",

      "question": "Are the cherry blossoms depicted with five rounded petals and a pale pink color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossoms are designed with five rounded petals each and are pale pink in color. This is a common representation of cherry blossoms, reflecting their delicate and soft appearance. Similarly, in Image A, the flowers also have five rounded petals and exhibit a light pink hue. Therefore, both images reflect a similar portrayal of cherry blossoms.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the bird’s feet orange-yellow in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to its stylized nature, the bird's feet are shown in a simplistic form and might not distinctly display rich color details evident in natural depictions. However, they appear in a brown shade. Comparing this to Image A, the bird's feet are visibly orange-yellow, indicating that Image B does not reflect the same color fidelity for the bird's feet.",

      "question": "Are the bird’s feet positioned as if gripping a branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's feet are positioned such that they appear to grip the branch, evidenced by their placement and curvature around the branch. This mimics the natural stance of perching birds. Similarly, in Image A, the bird also displays the natural pose of gripping the branch, confirming the consistency in posture between the two images.",
