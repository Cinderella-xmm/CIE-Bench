      "question": "Are the glass cups transparent and maintain their cylindrical shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image B shows two glass cups that exhibit transparency, allowing visibility of their contents and surroundings. Their shape is cylindrical, which is evident from the curvature of the glass and the uniform round base. This aligns with typical characteristics of glass cups designed for holding beverages, confirming their shape and material.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the beverage inside the cups retain its brown color and smooth texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beverage within the cups is visibly brown, suggesting it might be a type of coffee or tea. Its surface appears smooth, without any visible particulates or irregularities, indicating the liquid's uniform consistency. These observations are consistent with common hot beverages that are usually smooth and brown in color.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the steam visibly rising above the cups in a natural manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts steam wafting upwards from the cups, with a fluid, swirling motion that suggests natural steam behavior. The steam trails are thin and wispy, rising steadily, which is typical of freshly poured hot beverages. This observation is consistent with the usual depiction of steam rising from hot drinks.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the cups sit firmly on the wooden surface, showing their shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a metal outdoor table rather than a wooden surface. The cups are positioned securely on this table, with discernible shadows cast under them due to the lighting. The presence of shadows indicates a solid surface interaction and stable placement, complying with the typical dynamics of objects placed on a flat surface under light conditions.",

      "question": "Does the image retain a warm tone, highlighted by the steam and beverages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays an outdoor scene with a wooden cabin and snow, where a warm tone is accentuated by the sunlight and the contrasting colors of the beverage. The warm morning or evening sunlight enhances the warmth in the image, influencing the perception of the steam and beverages. This forms a visual warmth in a cold setting, typical of images leveraging natural light for warmth.",
