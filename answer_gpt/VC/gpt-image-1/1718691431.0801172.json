      "question": "Are the two upright, pointed ears with black outer edges and pinkish-red inner patterns present on the mask?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two upright, pointed ears that are clearly visible on both sides of the mask. The ears have black outer edges with intricate pinkish-red inner patterns, consistent with the coloring and design style typically associated with artistic or cultural representations of animals, particularly fox masks.",

      "question": "Are the human eyes clearly visible through the eye openings in the mask?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eye openings on the mask do not reveal human eyes. Instead, they are stylized and consistent with the design of the mask, which is inspired by animal features. The eyes appear more artistic, suited to the representation of a fox mask rather than showing actual human eyes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono has a V-shaped neckline and appears to be well-structured with wide sleeves extending from the shoulders. This is typical of traditional kimono designs, and the stylized representation captures these elements elegantly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono design does not feature a visible wide sash (obi) horizontally across the chest area. Instead, the kimono design is linear and structured without highlighting a central wide sash.",

    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mask design does not include distinct whiskers that alternate in black and white. The design of the mask focuses more on geometrical shapes and lines rather than detailing small features like alternating colored whiskers.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nose is centrally positioned below the artistic eye openings and is depicted as a small black oval. Beneath it, there is a faint mouth line, which is stylized and fits the overall symmetry of the mask design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the overall composition symmetrically balanced along the vertical axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
