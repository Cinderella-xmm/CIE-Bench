    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the three distinct mountain peaks—two broad and one sharp—present and positioned in the same relative layout as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on a fantastical creature against a night sky; there's no visible landscape featuring mountain peaks as in Image A. Therefore, the distinct mountain peaks present in Image A do not appear in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the lake located in the same basin with the same irregular shape, including the curved western edge and shallow extension toward the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains an otherworldly scene with a creature, and there is no visible natural body of water, such as a lake, with the described irregular shape. This makes the lake seen in Image A absent in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the trails maintain their original routing pattern across the slopes, including their connection to the lake and convergence points?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible depiction of natural terrain or trails as seen in Image A. The focus on the creature suggests an absence of natural trails or paths.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible human figures present near the shoreline of the lake, consistent with their placement in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the imaginary scene does not depict any human figures or a recognizable shoreline, unlike Image A where humans are present near the lake. Hence, such elements are absent in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the rocky outcrops and boulders visible along the shoreline and slopes, maintaining their original distribution and size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not illustrate a natural landscape with rocky outcrops or slopes. The focus is instead on a fantastical creature, lacking these landscape features that appear in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the green vegetation cover present across the slopes, maintaining its general distribution and density as seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any vegetation or natural slopes as seen in Image A. The scene is centered on an imaginative creature without such natural features.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the sky clear blue with scattered wispy clouds, matching the original atmospheric conditions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is depicted as a nighttime scene with stars, which differs from the clear blue sky with clouds present in Image A. This indicates a different atmospheric condition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
