    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the original facial features including the eye shape, nose contour, lip fullness, and symmetrical jawline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features in Image B are completely obscured due to the blurred region. We cannot see any details regarding eye shape, nose contour, lip fullness, or jawline symmetry. Therefore, the facial features cannot be retained as they are not visible.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the white hair still present, flowing down past the shoulders, and positioned naturally around the head and neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image B appears to be a mosaic artwork where the depiction of hair is stylized. Unlike the original representation of flowing white hair past the shoulders seen in Image A, Image B uses a different artistic style that abstracts this element. Therefore, the specific depiction of white hair with its positioning can't be seen.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the crown still present with its original angular, symmetrical design and central gemstone at the apex?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crown is present but depicted differently due to the mosaic style. Although the angular, symmetrical design is abstracted, the central gemstone is not clearly discernible. The mosaic style alters the detail seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the wings still symmetrically extended from the shoulders with the same broad, upward-curving shape and full span?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts wings that are symmetrically extended from the shoulders and have a broad, upward-curving shape, appearing consistent with the original image characteristics despite the different artistic representation.",
      "weight": 3,

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the figure still standing upright with arms at the sides and facing directly forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image retains the basic figure posture with the upright stance and arms positioned at the sides facing forward, maintaining the essence of the scene.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the original skin tone preserved, and does the facial expression remain neutral with a slight hint of serenity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mosaic artistic style in Image B abstracts the representation of skin tone and facial expression, making it impossible to identify the preservation of the original skin tone or facial expression.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the body proportions, including the torso width, arm length, and breast shape, consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a mosaic style to depict the body, which stylizes and alters the detailing of body proportions including the torso width, arm length, and breast shape. Detailed body proportions are abstract, and not consistent with the original image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
