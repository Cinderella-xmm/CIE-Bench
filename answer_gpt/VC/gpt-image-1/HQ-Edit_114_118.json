      "question": "Does the ship retain exactly three masts, with sails arranged in tiers on each mast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship inside the glass dome is depicted with three masts, each having multiple sails arranged in a tiered fashion, which is characteristic of traditional sailing ships. By combining this visual information with common knowledge of ship designs, it is clear that the ship retains the classic look of a vessel with three masts. Therefore, the setup meets the criteria of having sails in tiers.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the ship’s hull shaped with a raised stern and a decorated, upward-curving prow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship within the globe does appear to have an upward-curving prow, which is a classic design element of traditional ships used to cut through water. Its stern also appears relatively raised, indicating a typical hull design of historical ships aimed for navigation and stability. Therefore, these design aspects are consistent with the description.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there multiple sails on each of the three masts, with at least two tiers per mast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By observing the ship in Image B, the masts are seen filled with multiple sails, with at least two levels of sails on each mast, indicating a structured tier system typical of sailing ships designed for maximum wind capture and efficiency.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there at least five seagulls visible in flight around the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a scene of several seagulls in flight around the ship under the glass dome. Counting these birds, there are indeed more than five seagulls depicted, which are commonly associated with maritime environments and are a visual element added for aesthetics or thematic cohesion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the ship oriented such that the bow points toward the left side of the image and is slightly elevated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship within the display does have its bow pointed slightly to the left, with an evident rising angle, as it appears to be cutting through imaginary waters. This position emphasizes traditional marine navigation imagery, contributing to the directional cue of forward movement.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible portholes along the sides of the ship’s hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction within the glass dome suggests some detailing on the ship’s hull, which would normally include portholes, a traditional feature in ship design for ventilation and light. However, upon analysis, the specifics of portholes aren't distinctly visible due to the model's miniature and artistic style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the ship positioned above the surface of the water/resin layer, appearing to float?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship appears to reside above the water-like resin layer within the glass dome, simulating the appearance of floating. This presentation likely reflects both an aesthetic choice and a representation akin to a ship in open water, true to marine craft displays.",
