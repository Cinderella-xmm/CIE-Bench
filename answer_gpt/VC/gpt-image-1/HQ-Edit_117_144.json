      "question": "Is the elderly man depicted with a full white beard and white hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly man has been drawn in a simplified, cartoon style, and we can observe that his hair is shown as white. The beard appears similarly in the same style, suggesting that if there is a beard, it would be white. However, the beard appears more stylized as lines rather than full detailed volume.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the man standing upright with his right hand holding an object and his left hand in his coat pocket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted in a cartoon style. He is portrayed standing upright, with his right hand holding what appears to be a staff or cane. His left hand is positioned in a manner consistent with being in a coat pocket. The key visual cue is the simplified and stylized cartoon presentation showing this posture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the man wear a long overcoat over a sweater vest, shirt, tie, and trousers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the man in a cartoon format, wearing what seems to be a long overcoat with visible layered clothing beneathâ€”specifically, a sweater vest, a shirt, a tie, and trousers. The clothes are simplified due to the cartoon style, but they remain consistent with the layered outfit described.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background does not feature a detailed oval-shaped pool; instead, the figure stands on a stylized cobblestone path with no indication of a reflective pool. The cartoon scene focuses on the character rather than environmental detail.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the cartoonish representation of Image B, the man is indeed standing on what appears to be a cobblestone path. The path is simplified to stylized blocks and stones evident underneath the figure's feet.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is standing on a cobblestone path, and no pool is depicted behind him. The figure is shown facing forward in terms of orientation, but without the context of a pool's edge.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question": "Is the man holding an object in his right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is seen holding a staff or cane in his right hand. The cartoon style ensures this object is clearly depicted, aligning with typical representations of such a figure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a pool, so no ground surrounds a pool in this image. The ground where the man stands is stylized cobblestone. This depiction does not extend to a pool area.",
