      "question": "Does the robot still have two distinct upward-pointing antennae on its head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot is a miniature model encased in a glass container labeled 'RX-78.' The head of the robot still features two distinct upward-pointing antennae. This is visually consistent with typical Gundam designs, such as the RX-78-2, which are known for having such antennae. The intricacy in design and sharpness of the model's head confirm the presence of these antennae.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a blue-tinted visor visible on the robot’s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area where the robot's face would be located does not show a distinct blue-tinted visor. Instead, the face area appears to be detailed with metallic and grey tones without any clear blue tinting visible. This absence is noted based on the model's design characteristics visible in this image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there red glowing elements present on the robot’s chest and eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the robot as a non-illuminated miniature model, suggesting a static and detailed portrayal without dynamic elements such as glowing lights. The chest and eye regions do not exhibit any glow or distinct red light, which implies that there are no such red glowing elements present on the model in the given image.",

      "question": "Are the segmented armor plates with visible panel lines and rivets still present on the robot’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot in Image B includes detailed segmentation, replicating armor plates with visible panel lines and rivets, typical of a scale model designed to mimic the mechanical detail present in full-sized science fiction robots. This segmentation is a key feature observed in the robot's design, showcasing attention to detail and realism in model construction.",

      "question": "Is the distant city skyline with tall towers and construction cranes visible in the miniature landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a model within a glass display, with a miniature environment at the base. However, the landscape depicted is small and does not feature any elaborate city skyline or distant towers with construction cranes. Instead, the setting is simple and minimal, focusing more on the robot model itself rather than any extensive backdrop.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there small green trees present in the foreground and midground of the miniature landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the miniature scenery of Image B, there are indeed small green trees positioned among the earthy and natural-looking ground. This inclusion suggests an attempt to create a sense of scale and realism typical of such model settings, reinforcing the presence of these miniature trees.",

      "question": "Is there a visible dust cloud beneath the robot’s right foot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the robot in a static, miniature, and encased setting which does not allow for dynamic elements like dust clouds. The base upon which the robot stands appears solid and stable, with no indication of movement or displacement of elements like dust, which supports the inference that there's no dust cloud present.",
