      "question": "Is the helmet equipped with two curved horns and a central white feather-like adornment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in question is inside a snow globe, where a small character designed in a 'chibi' style appears closely related to a Viking or Norse theme. The typical Viking helmet is characterized by horns and sometimes has adornments. However, in this particular context, the small character has a helmet, but there is no visible central white feather-like adornment.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character inside the snow globe is holding a round shield. A central boss is common in shields for deflecting blows and rivets are typically used to hold parts together. The snow globe character's shield does not have a central boss or rivets.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in the snow globe is shown holding a small sword, but there is no visible sword sheath or hilt indicated at the back of the character. The character is in a snow globe, simplifying the details due to the chibi style.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow globe character doesn't have a shoulder pauldron or any detailed armor components. Chibi figures generally have minimalistic designs that often omit intricate patterns like Norse engravings.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character within the snow globe does not wear traditional armor, nor does it present a metallic texture or finish. The chibi style simplifies the design, usually reflecting a matte texture rather than metallic.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
