      "question": "Is the lid of the piano open and angled upward, revealing the internal structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the piano appears to be constructed from a gingerbread material, characterized by ornate decorative patterns. The lid is present, but rather than revealing an internal structure like strings as in a real piano, it displays more of these decorative elements, which are typical for a gingerbread model. World knowledge about gingerbread models suggests that they focus on external aesthetics rather than replicating the functional internal details of the objects they mimic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the piano have four legs, each ending in a golden caster, supporting the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gingerbread piano exhibits four legs that are intricately decorated but end in rounded feet instead of casters. In a gingerbread model, such stylistic choices are aligned with the artistic representation rather than functional mimicry, opting for ornamental balls rather than casters for aesthetic appeal.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there exactly three pedals positioned in a row beneath the keyboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gingerbread piano has three distinct pedal-like decorations beneath what would be the keyboard area. These appear stylized to reflect the typical pedal arrangement on a grand piano. While they might not function as pedals, their presence emulates the traditional visual setup.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the keys arranged in the standard piano pattern of alternating white and black keys across the full length of the keyboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's gingerbread piano shows a keyboard area, but instead of the standard piano pattern of alternating white and black keys, it features minimal decorative marks that might suggest keys, as world knowledge of gingerbread constructs often involves reducing complex details for artistic simplicity.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a music stand attached to the top front edge of the piano body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is no visible structure resembling a music stand, often characterized by a flat base with a back support for sheets. In this artistic gingerbread representation, the focus is more on the ornamental allure than on replicating functional elements like a music stand.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the lid connected to the piano body via a visible hinge mechanism near the rear edge of the keyboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no visible hinge mechanism connects the lid to the body of the gingerbread piano. Typically, a gingerbread model emphasizes decorative continuity rather than functional design features like hinges, which might not be replicated in such a model.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the piano maintain the same elongated, curved-body silhouette and proportional dimensions as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A, the gingerbread piano shares a similar silhouette to the grand piano in Image A, with an elongated body and gentle curves suggesting a faithful attempt at maintaining the recognizably grand piano shape, even if dimensions are not precisely matched due to artistic and material constraints.",
