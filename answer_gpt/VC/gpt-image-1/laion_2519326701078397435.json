      "question": "Is the bust oriented in a side profile facing to the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bust appears to be facing to the left rather than the right. The orientation is a frontal view with a slight tilt but doesn't show a side profile facing right. Typically, a side profile would depict a clear perspective of the ear and jawline from one side.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the neck, shoulders, and chest remain consistent with the proportions that are typically found in classical bust sculptures. The edited version maintains an anatomically realistic and artistically traditional form.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base in Image B is detailed with gears and motifs giving it an industrial aesthetic, deviating from a simple cylindrical form with flat top and rounded bottom. This is a distinct stylistic departure from traditional cylindrical pedestals.",
