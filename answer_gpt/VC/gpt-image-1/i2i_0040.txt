    "Question": "Q2: Does the bike still have a rear rack attached to it?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, attentive observation of the bike's rear section shows an illustration of a rear rack.

    "Question": "Q3: Is the bike still leaning against a wooden log?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a wooden surface parallel to the ground positioned next to the bike, similar to a bench or log.

    "Question": "Q4: Are there grass and scattered leaves visible in the foreground?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground is graphically represented with uniform green shading, typical of grass in illustrations. Unlike real life, where leaves might be individually depicted, the stylization omits detailed textures like scattered leaves. Therefore, the scene shows grass but not scattered leaves as per typical graphical interpretations.",
    "answer": "No"
