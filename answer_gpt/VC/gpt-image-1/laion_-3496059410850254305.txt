    "Question": "Q1: Is the Fender logo visible on the headstock?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character depicted is wearing a costume that resembles a guitar, but as a stylized superhero representation instead of a literal guitar. The helmet features a symbol resembling a treble clef, indicating a music theme, but not explicitly suggesting the Fender logo since the character design does not include any elements that typically showcase brand logos.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are there exactly six strings running from the bridge to the tuning pegs?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a fictional character designed to look like an anthropomorphized guitar superhero; therefore, the concept of physical strings running from the bridge to tuning pegs is abstract and blended into the overall design. Although the superhero's chest is designed like the body of a guitar, common sense about guitar anatomy using visuals from Image B doesn't clearly define six strings running from bridge to tuning pegs.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a cutaway on the upper right side of the guitar body?",
    "explanation": "Image B portrays a superhero with the body resembling a guitar, but given the artistic representation, the elements like cutaways in a typical guitar shape don't align accurately with the features of the character. The design does not include the characteristic cutaway found in guitars intended for easier access to higher frets.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the soundhole located in the center of the guitar body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the center section of the character's chest features a round shape, resembling a soundhole. However, this is part of a stylized design of a superhero and not an actual guitar body. Although it takes the place neat the center of the chest, the concept within the character design overtakes functional layouts typical in instruments.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the neck extend directly from the body to the headstock without significant deviation?",
    "explanation": "The guitar neck in Image B is conceptual rather than physical; the character's design incorporates guitar-like features prominently along the chest, but the integration is abstract and superhero-themed, thus no direct guitar neck extending naturally in the same fashion as an instrument.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there three tuning pegs on each side of the headstock?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the headstock feature is absent, and so are tuning pegs. The creative art does not recreate these mechanical parts of a guitar but presents a superhero character based on the thematic elements. Thus nothing in Image B resembles literal 'tuning pegs'.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the guitar body retain the classic dreadnought shape with a rounded lower bout and a cutaway on the upper right?",
    "explanation": "The superhero depiction in Image B incorporates elements that loosely resemble a guitar design but does not accurately display the typical dreadnought shape with distinguishing features like rounded lower bouts or cutaways due to its imaginative representation.",
    "answer": "No"
