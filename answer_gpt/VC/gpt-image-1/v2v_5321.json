      "question": "Is the character wearing a long-sleeved shirt with evenly spaced horizontal black and white stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is modeled in clay with clear horizontal black and white stripes across the arms and torso, indicating a long-sleeved shirt. The recognition of stripes comes from the alternating black and white pattern, a commonly known representation of this type of apparel. Thus, it is evident that the character is indeed wearing a long-sleeved shirt with horizontal stripes.",

      "question": "Is there a black beret on the character’s head with a small pin or button at the front edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted with a black beret on its head without any visible pin or button detail. The texture and form suggest it's a beret, which is consistent with cultural depictions of stereotypical attire worn by mimes. There are no visible additional details on the front edge of the beret.",

      "question": "Are there terracotta-colored rooftops and chimneys visible in the background behind the character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features clay-like representations of rooftops and buildings, which exhibit terracotta color tones. The visual cues suggest a stylized urban scene reminiscent of typical European architecture, known for terracotta tiles and chimneys. This indicates that rooftops and chimneys indeed occupy the background.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is shown with a noticeable red clay bow tie centered at the neck position. The contrast between the bow tie and the other elements of the outfit makes it easy to identify as a bow tie. Its positioning and color saturation imply it is bright red.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character with both hands depicted in a lighter, almost white clay texture, indicating gloves covering both hands. White gloves are often part of traditional mime costumes, further reinforcing this depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, black suspenders can be seen running over the shoulders and down to the waist where they meet the trousers. The three-dimensional details show a point where clasps would logically connect the suspenders to the waist, typical of this type of outfit.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B is holding a black clay model of an old-style cellphone with an antenna. The device is held up to the character's right side, which, when orientation is considered, corresponds to the character's right ear. This is consistent with the imagery of a person talking on a large phone.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of clay buildings, constructed without precise detailing found in real-life structures but lacking any explicit dome shape. The artistic style may obscure exact architectural forms, but no dome explicitly stands out in the skyline's composition.",
