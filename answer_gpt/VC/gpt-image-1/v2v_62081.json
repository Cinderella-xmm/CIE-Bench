      "question": "Is the portrait of the gentleman contained within an oval shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the portrait of the gentleman is clearly depicted within a rectangular shape, not an oval. The outer border surrounding the portrait is a stark rectangular frame. Through world knowledge, we understand that the oval shape is usually prominently displayed, making its absence evident here.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gentleman is depicted in profile, facing toward the left side of the portrait. The arrangement of facial features like the ear, eye, and the contours of the face suggest he is facing left. The profile view of faces displays one side and is indicated by the visible left-facing silhouette of his head.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cravat tied in a typical bow fashion around the gentleman’s neck. The bow shape associated with cravats is prominent and located beneath the chin. World knowledge suggests cravats are often tied this way during certain historical periods.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the gentleman with dark hair, but there are no visible sideburns extending to the jawline, nor is there a visible mustache. The area regarding facial hair is clean and the side profile shows no additional detailing of sideburns or a mustache.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gentleman is depicted wearing a coat that covers his shoulders and upper back. The broadness and contours of the fabric extend across these regions. Based on world knowledge, coats typically cover the upper body, and what is shown here corresponds to that understanding.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right side of the gentleman’s face does not display the nose, jawline, or eye due to the artist’s rendering of the left profile. The jawline and facial features are only evident on the left side, with the focus primarily on that profile.",
      "weight": 3,

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no oval portrait enclosed within a rectangular frame. The boundary around the portrait itself is a rectangle without any oval outline. This differs from common portrait arrangements where a rectangular frame might encase an oval, which is absent here.",
