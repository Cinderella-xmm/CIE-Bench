      "question": "Are the eyes of the figure still bright blue with clearly visible irises?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is depicted inside a snow globe and the face is blurred. Given this context, the eyes cannot be clearly assessed, hence we cannot determine their color or iris visibility.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the facial texture still characterized by deep, horizontal and vertical wrinkles and a cracked, stone-like pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is a stylized depiction with a blurred face, and features like deep wrinkles and cracked patterns cannot be assessed from the available details, considering the artistic portrayal inside a snow globe.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's hair is depicted to be flowing and extending past the shoulders. The long, white hair aligns with this portrayal, although the artistic style implies a more stylized version.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the blurred face and the stylized nature of the depiction, details such as a full white beard covering the lower face cannot be confirmed.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blurred face and artistic representation do not provide clear definition of facial features such as jawline or cheekbones, making it difficult to compare them with the original.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, within the artistic depiction of the snow globe, the neck is not visibly defined nor structured in the same detailed manner as Image A, given the stylized presentation.",
