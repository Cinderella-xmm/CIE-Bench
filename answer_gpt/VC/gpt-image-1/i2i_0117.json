        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character wearing a suit that features a panther-scale texture, noted for its intricate woven patterns that resemble the hide of a panther.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the character with arms raised, rather than relaxed downward, as they are holding a device, likely taking a selfie. The confident stance is still implied by the posture, but the arms are actively engaging in an action, which is inconsistent with a relaxed downward position.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the sharp lines and contours of the suit design, as seen in the precise tailoring and angular elements that define the suit's structure. The contours emphasize the character's form and the sleek design, synonymous with the Black Panther's style, is well preserved.",
