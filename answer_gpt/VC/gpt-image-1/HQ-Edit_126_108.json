    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the two large dark boulders positioned in the foreground grassy area near the cliff edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground contains prominent purple crystals instead of dark boulders, which are typically recognizable by their solid, opaque appearance and dark color. These crystals are not the dark boulders mentioned, indicating a transformation in the scene's elements. Hence, the original boulders are not present.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a visible dirt path curving through the grass toward the cliff edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no continuous path visible in the grassy foreground leading towards the cliff edge. The area is primarily occupied by purple crystals and a large elemental figure, which dominates the scene and likely obscures or replaces any such paths.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are tree branches extending from the top-left corner into the frame, casting shadows over the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no tree branches extending from the top-left corner into the frame as characterized in natural settings. The focus is on the large elemental creature and accompanying crystals, with no visible tree branches or shadows over the foreground.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sunlight illuminating the scene from the right side, casting warm golden light on the waterfall and mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunlight seems to illuminate the scene with a soft warm light; however, the source appears more ambient, highlighting the elemental figure and the crystals rather than directly casting a golden light from a specific direction.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a wide river flowing across a flat plain above the waterfall, with scattered green islands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wide river flowing across the flat plain with scattered green islands is noticeable. This setting contributes to the mythical theme presented by the elemental creature and magical crystals.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there dark, layered mountains visible in the background under a partly cloudy sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are dark, layered mountains observable in the background. They create a natural backdrop under a sky with scattered clouds, consistent with typical landscape depictions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there visible mist rising from the base of the waterfall and diffusing into the air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible mist rising from the waterfall's base. The scene is heavily fantastical, focusing on supernatural elements rather than natural physics like mist formation.",
