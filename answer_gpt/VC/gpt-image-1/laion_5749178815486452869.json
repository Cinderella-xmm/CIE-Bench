      "question": "Does the open umbrella retain its circular canopy shape with visible radial ribs converging at a central hub?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no open umbrella depicted. Instead, the focus of the image is a surrealist composition with floating elements like a large apple and flowers under a starlit sky. Therefore, there are no umbrella ribs or a circular canopy shape visible. This contrasts with Image A, where a circular umbrella with ribs was present. By using world knowledge about the typical appearance of an umbrella, it's clear that Image B doesn't contain these features.",

      "question": "Is the closed umbrella present with a black casing, wrist strap, and metallic tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no closed umbrella visible at all. The image is a surreal painting featuring various natural elements and surreal objects, like a large apple and a trapezoidal structure, without any umbrellas. This is different from Image A, which featured a closed umbrella with distinguishing elements like a black casing and wrist strap. Common knowledge about a closed umbrella and visual inspection confirms its absence in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the starlit sky with visible stars and nebulae still present as the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does retain a starlit sky with visible stars. This sky transcends into a surrealistic background with floating objects. Similar celestial elements were present in Image A. By using knowledge of starry backdrops and nebulae, it is clear that both images share this feature, enhancing a dreamy, surrealist ambiance.",

      "question": "Is the scene composed with flowers in the foreground, a hill in the midground, and the sky in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are flowers in what can be considered the foreground, a floating island where the apple sits in the midground, and a starry sky in the background. This layout somewhat matches the description but with notable surrealism. While Image A featured a realistic hill, Image B employs a floating terrain. Using common pictorial composition and the transition from the bottom (foreground) to the top (background), the scene holds similar structural composition.",

      "question": "Are the black support ribs visible and extending from the central hub to the edge of the canopy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's no visible umbrella or its components, such as black support ribs and a canopy. The painting showcases an artistic scene devoid of umbrella structures. This contrasts with Image A, where such elements were visible and pertinent to the depiction of an umbrella. Knowledge of umbrella anatomy confirms their absence in this inventive portrayal.",

      "question": "Are yellow coneflowers and red poppies present in the foreground of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features yellow coneflowers and red poppies, with both types clearly depicted amongst other elements like the floating apple. These flowers are stylized but recognizable, similar to Image A where these variants were present. Real-world flower identification affirms their presence, contributing to the vibrant, fantastical aesthetic of the painting.",
