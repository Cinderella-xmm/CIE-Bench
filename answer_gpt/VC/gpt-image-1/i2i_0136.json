      "question": "Does the edited image retain the green stem at the top of the orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a keychain model styled after an orange is visible. The top of the keychain features a green section resembling a stem, which suggests the retention of the orange's original stem. Based on visual cues and common knowledge of orange keychain designs, this part is modeled to imitate the stem of the actual fruit.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glossy texture of the orange still present on the keychain model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the keychain exhibits a glossy surface, evident from the reflections and highlights seen on its orange segment. This glossy appearance mirrors the textures seen on real oranges and aligns with typical keychain design aesthetics, where shine indicates a polished finish.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the keychain primarily colored in an orange hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a keychain modeled after an orange, with the main body of the keychain being a vibrant orange color. This is consistent with the design intention to mimic the appearance of an orange fruit. Commonly, keychains designed to look like specific fruits retain the primary color of that fruit.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the surface imperfections and texture patterns of the orange persist on the keychain model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain features dimples and surface textures similar to those found on an actual orange, maintaining the appearance of imperfections characteristic of the fruit's peel. This is evident in the designed texture patterns seen on the keychain, usually employed to enhance realism in novelty items.",

      "question": "Does the keychain maintain a proportional size and shape relative to the plate it rests on?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A, Image B shows the keychain alone on a flat surface, which doesn't provide the context of a plate for proportional comparison. Therefore, without an appropriate reference, the size and shape relative to a plate cannot be determined in the edited image.",
