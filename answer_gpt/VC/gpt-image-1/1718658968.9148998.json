    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the two tall towers positioned symmetrically on either side of the central section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two towers are visually identical and are located equidistant from the central section of the structure. This symmetry suggests they are positioned in balance, which is common in castle architecture for aesthetic and structural reasons.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a centrally located arched doorway with a wooden door beneath a rounded arch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an arched doorway located at the center of the structure where the arch has a smooth rounded shape, and there is no wooden door visible. Given this observation, the answer is based on the absence of a wooden door.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does a set of stone steps ascend from the water level directly to the arched entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the castle sits on a wooden base rather than near water, and the steps lead up to the entrance as part of the wooden puzzle structure, rather than from water. Therefore, in this context, water is not present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there multiple rectangular windows with dark frames aligned vertically on each tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each tower has windows, but they're designed to be part of a wooden puzzle with uniform earth tones rather than having dark frames. The puzzle style may not clearly distinguish dark frames, suggesting an absence of such detailing.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the tops of both towers feature flat surfaces with crenellated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the towers have flat tops and the edge features puzzle-piece-like crenellations mimicking true crenellations often found in castles, which are designed to look interlocking as part of the wooden design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a low stone wall extending horizontally from the right side of the castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure includes extensions horizontally from the castle on a wooden base, but the entire composition appears as wooden rather than stone. The design integrates the puzzle piece aesthetic, suggesting the choice of material visually represented.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
