    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the stylized \"P\" logo with a cart-like shape and circular wheel present on the surface of both tarts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which is an illustration, there is a cheesecake depicted with a smiley face rather than any stylized logo. This suggests a whimsical or fictional representation typical for illustrations and does not include specific logos that one might expect in commercial or real product images like in Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the word \"PABLO\" written in uppercase letters beneath the logo on both tarts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tart features a smiley face instead of a logo, and the setting seems to be a fantasy environment, implying no commercial branding or text beneath logos, contrasting with the original image of the real tarts.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the top surface of each tart display a bright yellow layer covering most of the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustrated tart indeed has a bright yellow top, which is colorful and typical for depictions of cheesecake. This characteristic is similar to the real cheesecakes in Image A, where bright yellow surfaces are evidenced.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible white creamy filling beneath the yellow top layer in both tarts, especially in the sliced portion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cheesecake is not sliced to reveal any interior filling. Instead, it is a single whole tart with a smiley face and animal figures, suggesting a fictional depiction without the emphasis on internal texture. This contrasts with Image A, where the real tart is sliced, showing white creamy filling.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the crust of both tarts exhibit a golden-brown color with a flaky, uneven edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration in Image B shows a tart with a golden-brown crust as part of its whimsical style, making it similar to the real crust's color in Image A, though it appears stylistically smoother rather than flaky.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the rear tart partially sliced to reveal the internal cross-section of the filling and crust?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a cartoon depiction and does not show multiple tarts or any partially sliced ones. It contrasts with Image A, where the real tart is sliced to show the cross-section clearly.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the whole tart positioned in front of the partially sliced tart, with the latter slightly elevated and angled toward the back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fictional setting in Image B features only one complete tart and tiny animals on top, not multiple tarts with a specific arrangement. This contrasts with Image A's arrangement of tarts as described.",
