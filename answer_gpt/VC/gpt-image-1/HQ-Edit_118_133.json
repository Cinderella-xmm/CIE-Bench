      "question": "Is the complex scrollwork and floral engraving pattern visible on the body, lid, and spout of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object showcases detailed and ornate designs, especially noticeable across its glossy black and gold surface.

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the object have a domed lid topped with a small finial at the apex?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts an object that appears to be a decorative candle holder designed as a teapot. The top of this object has a domed structure with a decorative finial at the apex. This is a common element in opulent teapot designs that aim to replicate the look of classic teapots.",
      "weight": 3,

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the object supported by a three-legged pedestal base with decorative feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a base is visible that supports the object, but it seems continuous and singular in nature rather than being segmented into three distinct legs. Instead of individual feet, there is a seamless pedestal base that extends smoothly from the body of the object, which refutes the characteristic of being supported by three legs. This indicates a more cohesive structure as opposed to a traditional teapot with legs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B clearly presents a curved handle attached on the left side of the object. This handle takes a familiar form, looping upward and backward, consistent with traditional teapot designs where handles facilitate easy gripping.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a long, curved spout extending from the right side of the objectâ€™s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design of Image B includes a long, gracefully curved spout emerging from the right side of the object's body. This element maintains the illusion of functionality associated with vintage teapot designs, emphasizing luxury and detail.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the object resting on a wooden surface, which reflects its base and lower body. The polished quality of the surface is evident by the visible reflection of the object, suggesting its smoothness and gloss typical of polished wooden furniture.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, while the handle appears ornate and fitting with the overall aesthetic of the object, there are no explicit decorative metal fittings at the attachment point to the body of the object. The object appears to be a single, cohesive piece integrating ornamental design without separate metal junctions.",
