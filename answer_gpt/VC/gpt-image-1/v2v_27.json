      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image displays the bear's distinct facial features, including the recognizable snout and ears, illustrated in a clear and cartoon-like style.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the bear is wearing a green Hawaiian shirt adorned with large orange polka dots, and a straw hat with a black band, similar to the original image.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features tropical background elements such as hibiscus flowers, typically associated with an island or beach theme. These flowers are smaller and placed as motifs rather than a full background but are still recognizable alongside palm frond patterns behind the bear in each pose.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image showcases different poses of the bear with potentially varied expressions capturing emotions rather than interactions with objects like a drink or chair seen in the original image. The focus is on expressions rather than actions or interactions with items, which is different from the original, where the bear was holding a drink and sitting on a chair.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images exhibit a vibrant and cheerful color palette featuring warm tones that enhance the tropical and cartoon-like atmosphere. The edited image applies such colors consistently across the bear's various expressions, with bright backgrounds for each pose, maintaining the cheerful and dynamic feel from the original.",
