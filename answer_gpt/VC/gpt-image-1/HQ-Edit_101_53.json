      "question": "Are the characteristic forehead wrinkles of the pug present and accurately represented in the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture of the pug shows pronounced lines and carvings on the forehead that mimic the typical wrinkles seen in pugs. These lines are distinctly represented, indicating an effort to retain these specific breed characteristics. Image A displays a live pug with natural skin wrinkles on its forehead common to its breed. Comparing both images, the carved lines on the sculpture effectively replicate the natural wrinkles, thus accurately representing this characteristic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the black muzzle and surrounding facial marking (including under the eyes and around the nose) preserved in the same location and shape as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture is entirely made of a dark wood color which blends everything into one unified color without differentiating a black muzzle or specific facial markings that include the areas under the eyes and around the nose. In contrast, Image A showcases a live pug with a distinctively black muzzle and facial markings. Thus, these facial markings are not preserved in the sculpture in terms of color differentiation and detail.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the large, round, dark eyes with clearly defined pupils preserved in the same position and shape as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture presents large, round, dark eyes that mimic the eye shape and position commonly found in pugs, as seen in Image A. The pupils in the sculpture are not as distinctly defined as in the live image but are nevertheless suggested by the shape and carving. Thus, the position and shape of the eyes are consistent with the original.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the floppy black ears positioned symmetrically on top of the head and shaped as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B has ears that are symmetrically placed and shaped like those in Image A. However, the sculpture’s wooden material results in the ears being the same color as the rest of the figure, thus lacking the distinctive black coloration. Despite this, the shape and position are preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the pug depicted in an upright sitting position with both front paws placed forward, matching the original stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the pug is depicted in an upright sitting position with both front paws placed forward. The artistic representation in the sculpture of Image B maintains this position, making the stance consistent with the original pug's posture in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the fawn-colored body area preserved in the same region as the original, contrasting with the black facial mask?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B does not preserve the fawn-colored body as it is made of a single-toned wood material. This results in a uniform color throughout the sculpture, unlike Image A where the pug shows a natural fawn color contrasted with a black mask. Therefore, the color contrast is not preserved.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the head-to-body proportion consistent with the original pug, maintaining a broad head relative to the compact body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the sculpture with a broad head relative to its compact body, which is consistent with the natural proportions observed in Image A’s live pug. Both images reflect the typical pug body type with a large head size relative to their sturdy, compact torso.",
