      "question": "Is the horse depicted standing on the elephant's back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe a horse figure placed directly on top of an elephant's back. The visual cues clearly depict the horse standing with its four legs evenly spaced on the back of the elephant, characteristic of an animated or chibi style. This spatial arrangement suggests that the horse is indeed standing on the elephant's back.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the elephant shown in a posture that supports the horse on its back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elephant in Image B is illustrated as a chibi-style figurine with its back perfectly flat and proportionally large, which visually supports the horse standing on it. The posture is consistent with supporting an object, like the horse, in this stylized depiction.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the background retain a photorealistic appearance with a grassy field and sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a background that mimics a realistic landscape with a grassy field and blue sky with clouds, similar to painted or cartooned representations. The presence of clouds and grassy textures gives the impression of realism within a stylized context but does not present photorealism as seen in natural photography.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the spatial relationship between the horse and elephant preserved, with the horse positioned above the elephant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is depicted as being positioned directly on top of the elephant, preserving the spatial arrangement from the original concept where the horse is above the elephant. This maintains the height order of the horse figure standing atop the elephant figure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes an ornate photo frame, which encircles the scene containing the horse and elephant figures. The frame adds a decorative element distinct from the initial open field presentation.",
