      "question": "Are ocean waves present and breaking onto the sandy shore?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized waves are depicted as curving lines with a crest, suggesting the form of ocean waves. Even though this is an abstract illustration, the visual representation implies breaking waves. Therefore, using world knowledge about wave illustration, the image suggests that ocean waves are present and breaking onto the shore.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the sandy beach present and curving from the foreground toward the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a stylized beach that curves from the foreground to the right. The lighter toned area represents the sandy beach, and its curve is consistent with the transition from one part of the coastline to another, typically indicative of a shoreline. Knowledge of beach aesthetics in art verifies its existence and curvature.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are palm trees visible along the coastline on the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Palm trees are clearly visible in Image B, depicted as simple stylized shapes along the right side. Their iconic silhouette and placement along the coastline on the right match the description. Knowledge about common stylized forms of palm trees helps confirm their presence along the beach.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there three distinct rock formations visible in the foreground sand, clustered together near the right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features three stylized shapes in the foreground sand that resemble rock formations, clustered together on the right side. Their darker color and position imply rocks. Understanding of common rock formations in artistic representation leads to the conclusion that these are rocks.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are footprints and ripple patterns visible in the wet sand near the waterâ€™s edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no explicit visual cues of footprints or ripple patterns in the sand near the water's edge. The abstract nature does not include these details. Without these specific indications, the sand remains plain. Artistic interpretation does not imply such features.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the coastline visible as a curved line extending into the distance, with green hills rising behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a series of curves in the background, with green coloration indicative of hills. These hills rise behind a curved line, likely the coastline. The stylized representation implies a shift from the foreground to the hills, consistent with typical landscape layout.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the sky visible above the horizon, featuring clouds with warm orange and pink tones near the horizon and transitioning to blue higher up?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B shows stylized clouds with warm tones like orange, and the sun suggests this color near the horizon. However, it does not transition noticeably to blue higher up, appearing more uniformly toned instead. Artistic choice focuses on simplification rather than a detailed color gradient.",
