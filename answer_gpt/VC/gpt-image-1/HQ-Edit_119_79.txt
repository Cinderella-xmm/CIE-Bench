    "Question": "Q1: Is the calico pattern of orange, black, and white patches preserved in the same spatial arrangement across the cat’s body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cat appears to be made of crystal, and the calico pattern is emulated through the use of colored crystal segments. While the colored crystals reflect the orange, black, and white calico pattern, the spatial arrangement may not precisely match natural fur patterns due to the faceted construction of a crystal sculpture, leading to a different visual presentation compared to the natural, blended appearance in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the eyes still green and positioned symmetrically in the center of the face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal cat has large, green crystal eyes positioned symmetrically on its face. Their placement is central and balanced, similar to a real cat’s face, keeping the appearance consistent with the positioning in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the cat in an upright seated position with both front paws placed directly in front of the body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal cat is depicted in an upright seated posture with its front paws positioned in front of the body. The posture mirrors that of a natural seated position in cats, as seen in Image A, supporting the idea that this characteristic remains consistent.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the pink nose present at the center of the face, surrounded by white fur on the muzzle?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a small pink crystal at the center of the face, functioning as the cat's nose. Although the surrounding area is composed of clear crystals and not white fur, the visual analogy is maintained, keeping the pink hue of the nose consistent with the natural appearance as in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the cat seated on a vertical wooden block that supports its full weight?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is placed on a round wooden pedestal rather than a vertical wooden block. This differs from Image A, where the cat is on a weathered wooden stump, indicating that while both are wooden supports, they differ in form and appearance.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the tail curled to the right side and displaying alternating orange and black bands consistent with the body pattern?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal cat's tail is composed of segmented colored crystals designed to emulate a patterned appearance. It is not depicted curling to the right in any notable direction and lacks the distinct patterning consistency seen in natural fur; thus, it deviates from Image A's depiction.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are both ears upright and pointed forward, symmetrically placed on the top of the head?",
    "explanation": "Both Image B and Image A show cats with upright, forward-pointing ears placed symmetrically on the head. Despite being crafted of crystal in Image B, the structure mimics this typical anatomical cat feature accurately.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Is there a large white fluffy area on the chest extending from the neck down to the front paws?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chest area of the crystal cat is rendered with clear crystals, which differ from the fluffy white fur seen in Image A. The lack of textual softness due to the crystal material cannot mimic the fluffy appearance of the fur, illustrating a distinct difference.",
    "answer": "No"
