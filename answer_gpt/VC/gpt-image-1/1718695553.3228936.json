    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the orange and black tiger stripe pattern present on the hippo’s body, head, and limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hippo toy is dressed in a design mimicking a tiger's stripes. The tiger stripe pattern is present on the hippo's body, head, and limbs, which is visually evident from the distinctive black stripes over the orange surface covering all these areas. This patterning is consistent throughout the entire plush toy, confirming the presence of the stripes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the visible knitted texture with distinct stitches present on the hippo’s body and the beach ball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hippo toy and the beach ball both exhibit a knitted texture. This is identifiable by the visible stitched pattern seen across their surfaces. The distinct stitches form the tiger stripes on the hippo and the multicolored sections on the ball, indicating a knitted material.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the face, belly, and limbs of the hippo rendered in light gray color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face of the hippo is rendered in a light gray color, which is part of its design. Similarly, the depiction of its nose and inner areas around the muzzle also suggests a light gray tone. However, the belly and limbs of the hippo are covered in the tiger stripe pattern, with no light gray visible, contradicting the question's claim.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the beach ball have red, yellow, and white horizontal stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beach ball features a pattern with red, yellow, and white stripes, however, these stripes are vertical, converging at the poles of the sphere, rather than horizontal. This distinct arrangement is clear from the design of the ball shown.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the hippo positioned leaning forward with its front limbs near the beach ball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hippo toy is displayed in a relaxed standing pose, without any specific leaning forward motion or contact with a beach ball. The hippo stands upright next to the toy ball rather than being positioned in a way that suggests leaning forward.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the beach ball round and approximately the same height as the hippo’s torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beach ball is perfectly round and situated next to the hippo. The ball is indeed smaller compared to the hippo, but when evaluated by relative scale and common toy proportions, it closely aligns with the height of the hippo's torso, making this observation plausible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the hippo have large dark eyes, a small curved smile, and small rounded ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hippo is indeed depicted with large dark eyes that are prominently placed, along with a small, curved smile indicated by the stitching of the plush. Additionally, the ears are small and rounded, completing the depiction of a friendly and approachable toy character.",
