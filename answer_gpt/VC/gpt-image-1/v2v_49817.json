      "question": "Is the pencil sharpener still present and serving its function in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pencil sharpener is depicted in a simplified, relief-style form, maintaining its presence and shape, suggesting it retains its function as a pencil sharpener. The visual information shows one person operating it, and another extending their hand toward it, indicating interaction with the object, therefore implying it serves the same function as in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the three individuals still interacting in their respective roles (scribe, observer, attendant)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the three individuals maintain their positions relative to the pencil sharpener. The person on the left is depicted as engaging with the sharpener, and the large individual on the right appears to be attentively extending a hand, suggesting a role similar to an observer or participant. The middle figure stands passively, suggesting an observer's role. This suggests the roles of scribe, observer, and attendant are retained due to these interactions.",

      "question": "Are the large windows still visible in the background of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is transformed into a simplified relief style, and the representation of windows is not evident. The focus in this representation shifts mainly to the figures and elements closely related to them, rather than detailed backgrounds.",

      "question": "Are there still scattered papers and pencils on the table in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the table with similar objects outlined in relief style where paper and pencils were placed in Image A. These items are simplified but can still be identified due to the forms resembling their counterparts in the original image, suggesting the presence of scattered papers and pencils.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the individuals positioned similarly in relation to each other as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the individuals appear to retain their relative positions, with one engaged with the sharpener from the left, one large figure sitting on the right, and one standing between them in the background. This similarity in positioning is evident from the consistent spatial arrangement in both images.",
