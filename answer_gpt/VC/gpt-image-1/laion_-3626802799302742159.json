      "question": "Are the cookies still golden-yellow in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects depicted, especially the cookies, are personified, taking on a more cartoon-like appearance with faces and bodies. Despite this transformation, the fundamental color of the cookies remains a consistent golden-yellow tone. This color consistency is crucial for maintaining the identity of the cookies even in their animated form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a red jam filling in the center of each cookie?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the cookies are personified, there is no visible red jam filling in the center of each cookie. Instead, the cookies have been given facial features and limbs, which changes their appearance from the original design shown in Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the mug white with black speckles and a handle on the right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mug retains its shape and basic form, with a corresponding handle on the right side, similar to Image A. However, the mug exhibits a pink hue rather than white, and the black speckled pattern seen in Image A is stylized and less pronounced, consistent with its animated style.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the plate pink with a speckled texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plate has been transformed into a different scene with a floral-patterned tablecloth and not a standalone pink plate with a speckled texture as seen in Image A. The setting diverges from the real-life depiction to an animated scene where environmental details differ from the original plate.",
      "weight": 2,

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are some cookies inside the mug and others arranged on the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original presentation of cookies inside a mug and others on a plate has been replaced by a single cookie in the mug, appearing sad, while other cookies are seated around a table. This is a departure from the arrangement seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do both the mug and the plate have a speckled surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mug lacks the explicit speckled detail seen in Image A, leaning more towards a solid pink hue. The arrangement no longer includes a singular plate but rather a scene with a floral tablecloth, differing from the speckled texture in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the mug smaller than the plate and positioned centrally on it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition has shifted to a playful animated scene without distinct separation of a smaller mug placed on a larger plate. The mug appears central but is not directly comparable in scale to a plate beneath it, as it shares the scene with a cloth and a small table setup.",
