    "Question": "Q1: Is there a river running down the center of the image from the foreground to the distant mountains?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a bold, linear feature that starts from the foreground, running down the center towards the background. This feature, depicted with parallel lines converging at a point, represents a stylized river perspective heading towards the mountains. This visual cue, when combined with knowledge about landscape art styles, confirms the presence of the river in Image B.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there two large mountain peaks visible in the background, one on the left and one on the right side of the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are two prominent triangular shapes in the background, each located on either side of the central vertical axis. These shapes are typically used to depict mountain peaks in stylized art. Based on the position and visual cues provided, it's reasonable to conclude that these are indeed representations of mountain peaks.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a bright circular light source positioned near the center of the horizon line in the background?",
    "explanation": "Image B prominently features a large circular shape in the upper central part of the image, which is consistent with a sun or light source depiction in this type of stylized artwork. Its positioning near the center of the horizon line, emphasized by radiating lines, supports this interpretation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there trees present on both sides of the river, extending along the banks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are multiple vertical shapes along both sides of the river path, which can be interpreted as trees given their resemblance to the style of trees common in simplified or geometric landscape art. Their positioning along and extending with the river confirms their existence along the banks.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there visible rock formations or landmasses within the river, breaking the water surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the river is depicted with a clear, unbroken surface, represented by smooth lines and consistent patterning without any interruptions or distinct shapes that could indicate rocks or landmasses. This simplified, stylized approach suggests there are no visible obstacles within the water.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the river reflect the trees and sky above it, maintaining a mirrored image across the water surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the river's depiction includes lines and colors that suggest interaction with its surroundings, but it does not show distinct reflections due to its geometric, stylized nature. Instead, emphasis is on pattern and symmetry rather than specific reflective details.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the trees on the riverbanks colored in warm autumn tones such as red, orange, and yellow, with dark green conifers interspersed?",
    "explanation": "Image B features trees that are shown in a palette of red, orange, and yellow tones, indicating autumn foliage. The presence of darker hued shapes resembling conifers interspersed among these warmer colors aligns with a typical autumn landscape scheme using stylized artistic methods.",
    "answer": "Yes"
