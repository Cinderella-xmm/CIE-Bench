      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is represented as a figure with dark brown hair. The hair is depicted as wavy, which is characteristic of many figurines that utilize simple, sculpted shapes to indicate texture.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the figure wearing a light blue outfit, consistent with the color of a shirt in the style depicted. By visual comparison, the bright color matches the concept of 'light blue'. This is reinforced by the similarity to commonly used color palettes for miniature figures. Yes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure does not have a visible chest pocket on the shirt. Such details might be simplified or omitted due to the compact and simplified design of figurines, where intricate features like pockets are often not replicated. No chest pocket is visible. No.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction shows the figurine's hands near a laptop but not directly interacting with the keyboard; they rest in front or on the table, which aligns with standard toy design where the hands are often not in detail-positioned states. No.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's head is oriented towards the laptop. However, a figurine's position remains static without the ability to show nuanced directional changes, so the assessment involves assuming the default forward pose of a figurine with head orientation slightly towards the laptop due to its simplified design. Yes.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a depiction of a laptop on a desk in front of the figurine. This visual cue is directly observable and matches world expectations for workplace settings, particularly for miniature models. Yes.",
