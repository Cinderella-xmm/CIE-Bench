      "question": "Is the \"DATSUN\" text visibly present and centered on the front of the decanter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the decanter shows the 'DATSUN' text clearly visible and placed prominently on the front of the design. This positioning is central and mimics the actual placement on the real car, as seen in Image A. These design elements are meant to highlight the brand and maintain a central visual focus, which is common for product replicas.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the \"240Z\" script visible on the side of the decanter near the front wheel well?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is no '240Z' script visible near the front wheel well or elsewhere on the decanter. This area is typically where specific model designations might be located on a real vehicle (as seen with the 'DATSUN 1600' in Image A), but this particular script is absent from the decanter design, likely because the decanter represents a different model.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the decanter maintain the long hood and short rear deck proportions of the original car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B with Image A, the decanter maintains a similar long hood and short rear deck characteristic. These proportions are indicative of sports cars like the one represented and are successfully mirrored in the decanter's design, providing aesthetic and thematic continuity with the original car.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are vertical slats visible on the front of the decanter, mimicking the original grille pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the decanter has a smooth appearance without the vertical slats that are present in the original car in Image A. The grille of the decanter does not replicate the vertical pattern but rather has a simplified, smooth design, which slightly deviates from typical grille aesthetics for ease of production in non-functional replicas.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the \"DATSUN\" emblem positioned centrally on the front face of the decanter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the 'DATSUN' emblem is indeed positioned centrally on the front face of the decanter, emphasizing brand representation and authenticity. This central placement is consistent with typical branding placement strategies to ensure high visibility, similar to the car in Image A.",
