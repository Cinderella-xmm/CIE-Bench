      "question": "Does the image retain the natural wool texture of the sheep?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep are drawn in a cartoon style, lacking the realistic wool texture that real sheep have. Instead, they feature smooth, stylized outlines typical of cartoon characters, which do not accurately depict the natural fibrous look of sheep wool. Therefore, Image B does not retain the wool texture of the sheep from Image A.",

      "question": "Do the sheep retain their darker facial and leg markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts sheep in a cartoon style, maintaining contrasting markings on the face and legs characteristic of the sheep's breed seen in Image A. Image B shows darker ears and eyes consistent with Image A's facial markings, although they are stylized rather than realistic, thus retaining the signifying features of their breed.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the grassy field setting retained, including the distribution of sheep?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not retain the grassy field setting or the natural distribution of sheep seen in Image A. Instead, it features a minimalistic background without any grass or sheep dispersed in the field, focusing solely on two cartoon sheep characters set against a neutral backdrop.",

      "is_correct": false

      "question": "Is the tree line marking the field's border retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is simplified and does not depict any tree line or other elements marking a field's border, which are present in the natural setting of Image A. Image B lacks such environmental details, focusing more on stylized cartoon frames.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sheepâ€™s natural behaviors, such as grazing or standing, retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict sheep engaging in natural behaviors observed in Image A, such as grazing or casually standing. Instead, the sheep characters appear upright and engaged in anthropomorphic behavior, holding rackets, and shaking hands as though participating in a social activity, which is distinctively different from natural sheep behavior.",
