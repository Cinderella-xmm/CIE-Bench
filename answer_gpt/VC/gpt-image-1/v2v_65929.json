      "question": "Is the spatial arrangement and relative positions of the machinery consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the machinery is transformed into whimsical, candy-like structures, yet they maintain a similar position and arrangement as those in Image A. Observing the sequence and placement reveals that despite the transformation, the spatial arrangement and relative positions have been preserved. This consistency indicates that the underlying layout remains unchanged even though the visual aspect has transformed drastically.",

      "question": "Are the ceiling trusses still providing structural support in the same manner as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ceiling trusses are depicted as candy cane structures, retaining their original form and function as seen in Image A. The orientation and layout suggest they still provide structural support similar to the metal trusses in Image A. Despite the decorative transformation, the essential supportive role is implied to be unchanged.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the overall proportions and layout of the room match the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the room retains a similar shape and perspective as seen in Image A, with the width and height of the space appearing consistent. The candy-themed transformation does not seem to alter the room’s fundamental proportions or layout, indicating that the structural dimensions remain the same.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the position and extent of the wall (now transformed into gingerbread) consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wall in Image B, now appearing as gingerbread, aligns with the position and extent as seen in Image A. The visual transformation alters the material but not the structural placement or dimension, suggesting that the wall’s position and extent are consistent across both images.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the floor (now a river of chocolate) still serve as a base for the machinery in the same way as the original concrete floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floor is illustrated as a river of chocolate, presenting a drastic transformation from the concrete floor in Image A. While it conceptually supports the machinery as a floor should, the fluid nature of chocolate compared to solid concrete suggests it might not function in the same supportive manner.",
