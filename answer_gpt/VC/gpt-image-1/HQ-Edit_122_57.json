      "question": "Is the vase's overall shape preserved, including its three-panel body, twin scrolled handles, and flared neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is rendered in clear glass with intricate patterns that suggest a luxurious and ornate design. Upon close inspection, the vase does not display a three-panel construction. Instead, it has a seamless decorative glass work with twin handles but no distinct panels are evident. The handles, while present, lack the distinctive scrolled character evident in more traditionally ornate vases. The neck appears modestly flared but blends into the body without sharp definition. Comparatively, Image A’s vase presents a decorated three-panel body visible with distinct scenes and scrolled handles. Thus, Image B lacks the described features.",

      "question": "Does the bouquet extend beyond the rim of the vase, creating an overflowing effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bouquet within the vase has flowers that rise above the rim and spread outward, reaching significantly beyond the confines of the vase. This creates a visual impression of fullness and vitality typical of arrangements designed to feel abundant. Comparing Image A, where the bouquet similarly rises well above the rim and has an overflowing appearance, Image B maintains this expansive arrangement approach. The bouquet’s outward reach and composition in both images align with an overflowing characteristic.",

      "question": "Are there scattered flowers on the surface of the pedestal, including at least one pink poppy and blue blooms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the pedestal below the vase holds several flower elements, distinctly separate from the main bouquet. Among these, a pink flower, which could be interpreted as a poppy given the color and shape, as well as a few distinctly blue flowers, are noticeable. To compare with Image A, where flowers such as a pink poppy and blue blooms are prominently scattered at the base, Image B mirrors this setup with recognizable similar elements and colors.",

      "question": "Is the vase positioned centrally on the pedestal within the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of the vase appears to be aligned centrally on top of a mirrored pedestal. The symmetry of the glass design in relation to the mirrored base and the balanced distribution of the bouquet contribute to this central placement. Comparing this with Image A, where the vase is similarly centered on the pedestal, the parallel alignment and balanced presentation in both images support a central positioning in both cases.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do some of the flowers rest directly on the surface of the pedestal, separate from the main bouquet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, it is clear that some floral elements, notably a few flowers, are situated directly on the pedestal surface, independent of the bouquet contained within the vase. This is visually evident through the distinct separation of these flowers from the main arrangement. Observing Image A, similar floral placement on the pedestal also occurs with flowers outside the main bouquet. This clear distinction between the primary arrangement and the individual flowers on the pedestal exists in both images.",
