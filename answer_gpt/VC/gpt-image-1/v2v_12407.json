    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the mango depicted with an oval shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object in the center is depicted with a rounded, elongated form that is consistent with an oval shape. This shape is often seen with mangoes. The pixelated art style still maintains the essential contours that indicate an oval, despite the detail loss.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a small stem visible at the top of the mango?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the mango does not show any visible protrusion or differentiation that would suggest a stem, possibly due to the pixelated nature of the image which simplifies details for stylistic effects.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the paper towel folded into a cradle-like shape beneath the mango?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a shape beneath the mango that suggests a wrapping or holding form, reminiscent of a cradle or nest. This appearance is consistent with how objects are supported within folded paper towels.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there four clearly defined flaps extending from the paper towel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are shapes around the lower part that appear to form four distinct sections extending outward, giving the impression of four flaps like in a folded paper towel.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the mango positioned in the center of the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the vague depiction of the surroundings and lack of table boundary details, the mango appears centrally placed within the visible area but not necessarily the exact center of the table.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the table show a horizontal wood grain pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pixels are colored in a way that suggests horizontal lines, typical of a wood grain pattern. This aligns with how wooden surfaces are often depicted, indicating the presence of such a pattern.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is a wooden chair partially visible behind the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From Image B, a form in the background consistent with the structure of a typical chair can be seen, though it lacks detailed features due to the pixel art style, it's enough to indicate a wooden chair presence.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is there a diagonal shadow cast by the mango onto the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains color variations on the table surface that suggest shadows cast by light. These variations suggest the presence of a diagonal shadow, likely from the mango, consistent with lighting effects.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
