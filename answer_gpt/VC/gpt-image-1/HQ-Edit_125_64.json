      "question": "Is the pyramid visible in the background to the right of the Sphinx, with a clear triangular silhouette against the sunset sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a pyramid is indeed visible in the background to the right. However, the subject is not a traditional Sphinx; instead, it is a stylized, golden Sphinx-like figure with additional features like wings and a radiant disk for a head. The pyramid appears distinct and maintains its triangular silhouette against the vibrant sky.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the sun positioned low on the horizon, directly behind the Sphinx, emitting a bright circular glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sun is indeed positioned low on the horizon. However, the primary source of bright circular glow is a radiant disk atop the stylized creature rather than the natural sun, which is off to the side. Still, the sun itself is visible slightly off-center and emits a circular glow as part of the sunrise/sunset scene.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a dense layer of clouds below the Sphinx, appearing illuminated with orange and pink hues from the sunset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a dense layer of clouds below the stylized Sphinx-like figure. These clouds appear to be illuminated with warm hues of orange and pink, consistent with the sunset lighting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the Sphinx facing toward the right side of the image, with its profile visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Sphinx is a stylized version with a radiant disk and wings facing the left instead of a traditional Sphinx facing the right. This shift in orientation means its profile is not visible in the traditional sense.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the sky show a smooth gradient from warm orange near the horizon to cooler purple and pink tones at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky does exhibit a gradient, transitioning from warm tones of orange near the horizon to cooler purple and pink hues towards the top.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entity in question is a stylized, fantastical version of a Sphinx and does not feature traditional erosion lines or layered textures typically observed on historical structures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there sand visible around the base of the Sphinx, particularly near the front paws and lower body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible sand around the base of the Sphinx-like figure. Instead, the base seems to blend into the clouds, which dominate the scene and replace any ground-level details such as sand.",
