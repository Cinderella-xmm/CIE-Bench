    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the subject's face, including the almond-shaped eyes, straight nose, and closed mouth with red lips, preserved in the same position and form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face details like almond-shaped eyes, straight nose, and closed mouth with red lips are not visible due to blurring. This makes it impossible to confirm if the original facial features and their positioning are preserved.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the subject’s hair color (reddish-brown) and tightly curled, rounded hairstyle preserved exactly as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual elements show reddish-brown hair that appears curly, and its placement suggests a rounded hairstyle. However, exact details could differ due to proximity differences and artistic interpretations.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the jeweled headpiece with a single dangling pendant at the center of the forehead preserved in the same location and form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks any visible indication of a jeweled headpiece with a dangling pendant at the center of the forehead, suggesting there is no preservation of such a headpiece.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the right hand positioned on a decorative object (such as a hilt) and the left hand resting on the lap, maintaining the same relative placement and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right hand appears to rest on the chest, and the left hand is situated between the waist and thigh area, indicative of a posture drastically differing from any descriptions involving decorative objects.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the subject’s skin tone (pale with subtle rosy blush on the cheeks) preserved without significant alteration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Biased by the blurring of the facial area, close observation of skin outside this zone suggests a pale tone; however, without detailing specific cheek coloration, it's difficult to ascertain if it's exactly preserved.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the torso's attire and posture suggest a forward-facing, symmetrical stance, displaying compositional balance that aligns with upright posturing assumptions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
