      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat depicted has upright ears as part of its toy-like or cartoonish design. The ears are positioned correctly for a cat, straight and attentive, without any abnormal tilting or flattening. Based on world knowledge of cat anatomy, upright ears are typical in relaxed or alert states, and the design in Image B maintains this typical appearance. Thus, observing the visual setup in Image B, it is reasonable to conclude that the cat does retain upright ears.",

      "question": "Are the cat's large expressive eyes preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cat in Image B is shown with comically large, expressive eyes which resemble a stylized cartoon character. This involves exaggerated features that are meant to capture attention and express emotion clearly, which aligns with the concept of expressive eyes. Utilizing world knowledge of stylized character designs, large eyes are a common feature used for expressiveness. Therefore, image B does preserve large expressive eyes.",

      "question": "Is the cat's sleek fur texture retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a finely crafted toy with a smooth surface meant to imitate fur in a simplified manner. Instead of realistic fur texture, the design suggests a minimalistic approach that conveys the idea of fur without fine details. The use of materials emphasizes a smooth textile instead. Given this observation combined with common design choices in character models, the sleek fur texture as originally presented is not retained.",

      "question": "Does the cat maintain its upward gaze and posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat character displays a forward-facing posture, looking at the viewer, which does not convey a specific upward gaze. As per the elements of the design, the head position suggests engagement with the observer rather than an upward focus. Based on understanding figurines and stylized representations, gaze direction is an important expressive detail, and this differs from the supposed upward gaze in another context. Hence, the upward gaze and posture are not maintained.",

      "question": "Are the cat's whiskers still visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cat with simplified whiskers as part of its cartoon-like design. Whiskers are depicted in a straightforward style, maintaining a presence though without realistic detailing. World knowledge tells us that whiskers are a prominent feature in feline imagery and are retained in simpler forms for stylization, so based on its visual representation, the image effectively maintains visible whiskers.",
