      "question": "Is the bottle’s main body still a transparent rectangular glass container with softly rounded edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle's main body is clearly visible as a transparent glass container with softly rounded edges. The rectangular shape is characterized by its flat surfaces and corners that are not sharp. This is consistent with typical glassware design where such shapes are used for elegance and practicality. Therefore, the bottle in Image B maintains these design features, indicating it is a transparent rectangular glass container with softly rounded edges.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the interior of the bottle filled with a golden-yellow translucent liquid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the liquid inside the bottle is visually identifiable as having a golden-yellow hue and is translucent, allowing some light to pass through but diffusely scattering it, which is typical for such colored liquids in bottles. This observation aligns with common appearances of liquids in glass containers, thus confirming the interior of the bottle is filled with a golden-yellow translucent liquid.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the black box with the arched cutout and gold text \"CADENHEAD'S\" at the top and \"ESTD. 1842\" at the bottom still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a box next to the bottle, but it is dark green, not black. While it does have an arched cutout, the text 'CADENHEAD'S' at the top is present, but the bottom text 'ESTD. 1842' is replaced with 'HOME DIFFUSER.' This indicates a change in the box's design and color differentiation from the original black box.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible reflections and highlights on the glass surface of the bottle indicating transparency and smoothness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass bottle displays reflections and highlights that suggest it is smooth and transparent. These optical effects are characteristic of glass materials as they interact with light, confirming the material's texture and transparency.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the bottle positioned to the left of the box, with the box’s arched window aligned to frame the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning shows the bottle situated to the left of the box, which indeed has an arched window. This alignment between the bottle and the box is evident as the arched cutout frames the bottle, maintaining a consistent presentation style.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the bottle have a flat, thickened base that rests stably on the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the base of the bottle appears thick and flat, a typical design choice to ensure stability when rested on a surface. This structural detail prevents the bottle from tipping over easily, thus confirming a flat, thickened base.",
