      "question": "Is the blue herringbone-textured jacket retained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl character does not wear any clothing similar to a human jacket, specifically not a blue herringbone-textured jacket as seen in Image A. Instead, the owl has feathers. Human clothing items, especially those with specific textures, like the herringbone design, aren't represented in the owl illustration which features cartoonish elements.",

      "question": "Are the collar and lapel shape of the blue jacket preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image B consists of a cartoon owl that is not wearing a jacket, so there is no collar or lapel to be seen. Image A, however, features a clearly visible jacket with distinct collar and lapel shapes. Such design features do not translate into the cartoon representation in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are two microphones visible in front of the speaker in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains only one microphone in front of the owl character. The owl is depicted as standing in front of a single microphone, indicating a difference from Image A, which shows multiple microphones. The cartoon style of the owl replaces multiple microphones with a singular one.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the speakerâ€™s right hand raised with an open palm in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl raises its wing in an expressive manner similar to a hand gesture, given its posture. However, the natural anatomical differences between owl wings and human hands make it impossible to mirror the open palm gesture seen in Image A. The absence of a human-like hand gesture in a cartoon owl illustration is expected.",

      "question": "Is the circular emblem with a blue center, gold border, and star pattern visible on the podium in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display a podium or any emblem resembling the one in Image A. It focuses on an owl illustration with no hints of a podium or emblem, emphasizing thematic designs apart from the formal setting of Image A.",
