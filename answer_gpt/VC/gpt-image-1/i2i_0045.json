        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl is depicted in a dynamic pose as she is captured mid-action, throwing a frisbee. Her posture shows an outstretched arm for the throw and a coordinated balancing stance on the stone platform.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone platform appears stable and adequately positioned under the girl's foot, supporting her posture as she throws the frisbee. The platform's rectangular shape and consistent texture suggest it is unchanged in shape and position.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The captured frisbee in Image B is flying through the air with a clear circular shape, which is typical for frisbees, and its bright yellow color is vibrant and stands out against the blue sky. These elements indicate preservation of the frisbee’s original design.",
