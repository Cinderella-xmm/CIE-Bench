      "question": "Is the man depicted holding a newspaper open with both hands and looking at it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, each depiction of the man shows him sitting on a bench and holding a newspaper with both hands in front of him, thereby reinforcing the pose. The common portrayal in such imagery is that the person is engaged in reading the newspaper through visual attention. The consistent positioning of the newspaper and the man's hands strongly suggests he is looking at and holding the newspaper open with both hands.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the object being read clearly identifiable as a newspaper with columns and printed content?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the visual representation features the man holding rectangular objects with lines indicative of text or column layouts in a manner typical of newspapers. Such depictions often imply printed content and organized layout characteristic of newspapers, providing a clear inference through visual representation.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a tan leather shopping bag with two handles placed on the bench to the man’s right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there is no representation of a tan leather shopping bag with handles on the bench. The man is depicted alone with a newspaper, similar across different panels. This indicates that in the edited image, items such as shopping bags are not included in the visual context.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the man seated on a wooden park bench with slats and armrests?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, multiple panels depict the man seated on a wooden park bench. Each bench is illustrated with slats visible on the seat and backrest but does not display armrests as part of its design. The illustrations focus on bench slats rather than armrests.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are red, orange, and yellow maple-shaped leaves visible on the bench, ground, and surrounding trees?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, although autumn-themed visuals are predominant, the illustration depicts stylized trees and leaves without showing specific ground or bench details with fallen leaves. The panels capture the essence of the season but maintain focus on the man reading a newspaper, with illustrative leaves floating around the man.",
      "weight": 3,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the man's attire features a brown overcoat or outerwear garment, structured to suggest he wears a tie based on typical formal depiction styles. Given the illustration's stylized nature, the color choice of ties is unclear due to the similar hues used rather than distinct mustard-yellow identification.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, stylized illustrations show the man with shoes sketched in a formal style that aligns with common slip-on loafers, characterized by their low-cut appearance. These details provide strong evidence of fashion choice through illustrated design focusing on the loafer's appearance.",
      "weight": 1,

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, despite the stylized portrayal attempting to simplify features, the man’s eyeglasses are not prominently illustrated in round, wire-rimmed style. Focus is placed on general attire and activity without detailed attention to explicit eyewear configuration.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, thematic autumn leaves are suggested through imagery but not directly illustrated as accumulated on the ground beneath benches. The focus remains on seasonal ambience via tree and floating leaf imagery rather than ground coverage.",
