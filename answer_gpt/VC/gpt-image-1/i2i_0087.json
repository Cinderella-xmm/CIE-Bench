    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the clock face still white after the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face is visibly white as seen in the center of the clock. The background is blue, which contrasts with the white face, confirming its color. Common knowledge tells us that a white clock face is often used for clarity, making reading the time easier.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both the hour and minute hands still black after the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows both the hour and minute hands of the clock distinctly as black. Examining these hands, they stand out against the white clock face. Black is a conventional choice for clock hands for clear visibility, thus the color remains unchanged.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there still a red second hand on the clock after the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, there is a thinner, red hand present among the clock hands, which is typically associated with the second hand due to its distinct color often used for differentiating from the hour and minute hands.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the orange pivot point still present after the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the center where the clock hands meet, a small circle is visible at the pivot point, colored orange. This is in line with traditional designs where a contrasting color is used at the center for aesthetic differentiation and functionality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a clean clock face with no visible numbers or markings. This design choice of minimalism implies ease in visual aesthetics and can be seen when analyzing modern or artistic clock designs.",
