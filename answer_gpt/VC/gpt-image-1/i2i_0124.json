      "question": "Does the image retain the cylindrical, elongated shape of the baseball bats?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the baseball bats are represented with an elongated, cylindrical shape, consistent with their typical physical characteristics. Analyzing the visual cues, the wooden shafts in Image B still depict a realistic baseball bat form. By examining Image B, the bats retain a consistent appearance, demonstrating the traditional slender and long characteristics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the black taped handles of the bats still distinctly visible against the wooden shafts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ends of the bats feature a change to a different hue and texture, distinctly from the rest of the wooden shaft, depicted with the black color usually associated with tape wraps on bat handles. This distinct color change provides a clear visual separation, indicating that the black taped handles are visible against the rest of the bats' wooden sections.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the two baseball bats remain parallel to each other in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two baseball bats that appear to run parallel from the handle to the end. The alignment of the bats in relation to each other, where neither crosses or diverges extensively in visual presentation, visually reinforces the parallelism maintained in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the bats still placed on a grassy surface, indicating an outdoor setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bats are illustrated to be lying on a textured green background that resembles grass, suggesting an outdoor environment by common visual indicators associated with grassy surfaces. The portrayal of grass in Image B is in line with a typical outdoor setting where such sports equipment would be found.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bats maintain their slight angle toward the viewer, preserving perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bats angled such that the thicker end is more prominent than the handle end, indicating they are situated to appear larger at the foreground and recede slightly into the background, preserving the sense of perspective towards the viewer. This angular view aligns with the visual technique used to convey dimensionality and depth.",
