      "question": "Is the neck of the swan-shaped object still curved in an elegant S-shape, extending upward and backward from the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object appears to have a swan-inspired design with a neck that shows an elegant curvature, typical of a swan, extending from the body. The design mimics the graceful S-shape known from real swans, which is an intentional replication for aesthetic purpose. Therefore, the neck maintains this S-shape effectively.",

      "question": "Are the pink berry-like accents visible on the evergreen sprigs surrounding the base of the swan?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the evergreen sprigs adorned around the base of the swan-shaped bottle do not show pink berry-like accents. Instead, there are red poinsettia flowers and other decorative elements. Image A, on the other hand, had pink berry-like accents which are absent in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, we find a white snowflake-shaped ornament near the base of the swan-shaped bottle. This ornament is part of the decorative elements around the base, contributing to its winter-themed design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background and surface upon which the swan-shaped bottle rests do not display any texturing or snow-covered characteristics. The surface appears smooth and lacking texture, unlike Image A where the swan was resting on a snow-covered surface.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is devoid of any human figures or strings of colorful lights. It has a plain, neutral backdrop which isolates the focus on the swan-shaped bottle itself. Image A included blurred figures and colorful lights which are absent in Image B.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the swan-shaped bottle is oriented such that the head of the swan points towards the left side of the image. This orientation is similar to Image A, maintaining the position and direction of the swan's head.",
