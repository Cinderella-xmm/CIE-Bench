    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the carrot slices clearly circular in shape with visible concentric rings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot slices are visibly circular, displaying a central circle surrounded by a distinct ring, which gives the appearance of concentric circles. This is a common characteristic of carrot slices due to their cylindrical structure when cut horizontally.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the cauliflower florets retain their natural branching structure and clustered bud formation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cauliflower florets exhibit a natural branching structure with multiple small buds clustered together, which is typical of cauliflower when cut into florets. This structure is easily recognizable due to the small, compact groups of cauliflower buds.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are all the carrots and cauliflower florets contained within the bowl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a glass bowl with all visible carrot slices and cauliflower florets securely contained within its edges. There are no vegetables spilling over the side of the bowl, indicating that they are all fully contained.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the arrangement of vegetables in the bowl natural and non-symmetrical, with both carrots and cauliflower present in similar quantities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of the vegetables appears natural, without any structured or symmetrical pattern. The quantities of carrots and cauliflower appear similar, with both types of vegetables mixed throughout the bowl, making the arrangement look random and natural.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the carrots distinctly orange and the cauliflower distinctly white in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts carrots with a vibrant orange color, contrasting sharply with the distinct pale white of the cauliflower florets. These distinct colors are characteristic of fresh, raw carrots and cauliflower, assisting in visual differentiation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there multiple distinct carrot slices and cauliflower florets visible in the bowl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows multiple carrot slices and cauliflower florets distinctly visible within the bowl. Instead of seeing singular pieces, the bowl contains a variety of both, with clearly separate carrot slices and florets.",
