      "question": "Does the blue owl still have large white eyes and a yellow beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl has been artistically redesigned with a more intricate and patterned style. However, it still prominently features large eyes, which are a focal point of the design. These eyes are large and white, matching the common stylistic depiction of eyes in such designs. The beak, although nestled amid patterns and details, retains a central position and is colored yellow, which is visible though muted compared to the more vibrant original. This is consistent with traditional owl imagery.",

      "question": "Are there still smaller owls present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, below the main owl there are smaller owl figures integrated into the ornamental design, visible amidst the swirling foliage patterns. These smaller owls retain key owl characteristics such as big eyes and rounded shapes, allowing them to maintain their identity despite the stylized approach.",

      "question": "Is the text \"OWLEGORIES\" still present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title 'OWLEGORIES' remains prominently displayed. It retains its central placement and recognizable font, though the style has adapted to the new ornamental and intricate theme of the image. This allows the title to remain a focal point and integral part of the design.",

    {

      "question": "Is the owl still holding a book?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B shows that the owl does not appear to be holding a book. The decorative design prioritizes symmetry and ornamental style rather than depicting any specific object directly being held by the owl. This differs from Image A where the owl's holding of a book was explicit and specific.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the phrase 'SHOP NOW!' is incorporated into the design, forming part of the complex pattern and layout. Its presence is stylistically adjusted to fit the theme but remains identifiable as text, allowing it to serve its intended purpose as part of a call to action within the design.",
