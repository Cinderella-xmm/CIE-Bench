      "question": "Is the sun-shaped ceiling light fixture present and positioned at the center of the ceiling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ceiling light fixture is visible and designed in a sun shape, with light rays pointing outward, which is positioned near the center of the ceiling. The design and placement indicate it is a focal point for lighting the room. This knowledge aligns with typical interior design for centralized ceiling lighting.",

      "question": "Is the wooden bedside table located to the right of the bed and supporting a lamp and flower vase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a wooden bedside table is clearly visible on the right side of the bed. It is supporting a lamp and a small vase with flowers. This arrangement is typical in bedroom settings for easy access to lighting and decorative elements. A similar arrangement is present in Image A, also indicating standard bedroom decor.",

      "question": "Is there a dark rectangular rug positioned directly beneath the bed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a dark rectangular rug visible positioned at the foot of the bed rather than directly beneath it. The position is typical for accent rugs in bedroom settings, often placed for aesthetic purposes and to provide a soft surface, usually extending from beneath the bed. However, the phrasing of 'directly beneath' suggests coverage closer to the central underside of the bed.",

      "question": "Is there a window with sheer white curtains visible on the left side of the room?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left side of the room does not show a window with sheer white curtains. Instead, the focus on decor such as the lavish bed and drapery takes precedence, and no visible window is present. The comparison with Image A shows a window with sheer white curtains on the left, common for sunlight filtering in bedrooms, but such is absent in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the floor covered with tiles that appear light beige and are arranged in a square grid pattern. This layout is typical for tiled flooring, providing a uniform and clean look often seen in bedrooms and various interior spaces for a neutral aesthetic. The same pattern is visible in Image A, confirming uniformity.",

      "question": "Is there a lamp with a patterned shade and metallic base on the bedside table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lamp on the bedside table has a more ornate design with an elaborate lampshade, but it does not clearly indicate a patterned shade associated with a metallic base as described. Rather, it matches the luxurious and vintage theme prevalent in Image B with detailed craftsmanship, unlike the simpler lamp in Image A.",
