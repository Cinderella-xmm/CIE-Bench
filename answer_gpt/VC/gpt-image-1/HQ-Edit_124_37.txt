    "Question": "Q2: Is the subjectâ€™s head tilted upward with her gaze directed toward the sky?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, although the face is blurred, the head position can still be assessed. The head appears to be in a neutral forward-facing position rather than tilted noticeably upward. Without clear upward tilt in the neck or a hint of skyward gaze in the body posture, we conclude the head is not tilted upward.",
    "answer": "No"
