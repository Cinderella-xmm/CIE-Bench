        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a clear, symmetrical reflection of the dragonfly visible on the water surface directly beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main subject appears to be a humanoid with insect-like features rather than a dragonfly. The water surface shows a reflection of this figure. In Image A, a dragonfly is directly reflected on the water's surface, but the edited image lacks this characteristic reflection of a dragonfly.",
      "weight": 3,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure resembling a humanoid with wings is shown over the waterâ€™s surface, but it is not parallel to the water plane like a hovering dragonfly might be. Image A, however, shows a dragonfly with its body parallel to the water plane. This is common in images depicting dragonflies in realistic settings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a bright light source in the upper part, creating a diffused lighting effect over the scene. This visual feature is typically used to create an ethereal and lively atmosphere similar to sunlight filtering through foliage.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the context of slender green stems and leafy structures extending from the water is less emphasized. While such elements are present in Image A, Image B focuses more on its subject, with minor emphasis on stems and supporting structures for flowers.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the background composed of blurred green foliage with visible patches of sunlight filtering through?",
      "choices": [
