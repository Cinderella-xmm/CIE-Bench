    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the plaid pattern (with red, blue, and black intersecting lines) on the left tie preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see a plaid pattern on the tie of the figure on the left. This pattern features diagonal intersecting lines, similar to a tartan design, which suggests that the original plaid pattern is preserved. In Image A, the tie has a distinct plaid pattern, confirming its presence in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the green and yellow bear-shaped emblem on the right tie preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the emblem on the right tie appears to be a simple shape, rather than the intricate green and yellow bear design seen in Image A. This suggests that the emblem is not preserved in the edited image.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both ties are depicted as vertical, non-tapered extensions of the head, rather than the traditional necktie shape seen in Image A, which includes a tapered and diagonal appearance across the chest.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
