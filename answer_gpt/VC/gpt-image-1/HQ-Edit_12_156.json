      "question": "Does the structure retain four distinct legs forming a wide base that converge upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure is reminiscent of the Eiffel Tower and features a single base that is elaborately decorated rather than having four distinct legs as observed in traditional structures like the original Eiffel Tower. The visual cues, including the complex floral design, indicate a merger into a singular base rather than independent legs. Thus, based on the visual cues and known architectural styles, the structure does not exhibit four separate legs converging into one main tower.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the tower’s shape vertically tapered, narrowing progressively from base to spire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a tower structure that follows a vertical tapering pattern, narrowing from its broader base upwards towards a pointed spire, consistent with typical tower designs, including fantasy and real-life structures. The tapering effect is visually accentuated by the decorative elements that spiral upward, contributing to the visually perceived narrowing of the structure.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there three distinct horizontal levels or platforms visible along the tower’s height?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the design incorporates intricate decorations and lacks clear horizontal platforms that divide the structure into levels. Each segment of the tower appears to be adorned with floral elements, devoid of defined horizontal platforms seen in conventional tower architecture, such as the original Eiffel Tower. Therefore, based on these observations, the image does not display three distinct horizontal levels.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tower centrally positioned in the image, aligned with the center of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower is prominently situated at the center of the frame, acting as the focal point of the image. The symmetrical composition aligns the tower with the center, a common technique in art and photography to emphasize subjects. This positioning, coupled with the background celestial and landscape elements, collectively indicate a central alignment.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a straight, symmetrical pathway extending from the foreground directly toward the base of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there appears to be a circular decorative element at the base of the tower without any visible straight, symmetrical pathway leading towards it from the foreground. This circular motif contrasts with the expected straight pathway usually associated with entranceways leading to towers in landscapes. Therefore, based on the lack of direct and linear pathway indicators, the answer would be no.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the light source (sun or equivalent) located directly behind the base of the tower, creating a halo effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction includes a radiant body, possibly the sun or a similar light source, placed directly behind the base of the tower. This positioning creates a striking halo effect due to the light illuminating the outline of the tower and its intricate design against the backdrop of a vivid sky. The ensemble of visual elements, with the light source centered behind the tower, supports this conclusion.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a visible cityscape in the background, extending horizontally behind the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B primarily showcases a celestial background filled with stars and nebulae, lacking the horizontal expanse of a cityscape seen in urban settings or the original image. The artistic choice features a fantastical sky beyond the tower. Therefore, through the visual interpretation of the sky and its elements, no cityscape is discernible in the backdrop.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the tower significantly taller than all other structures in the image, dominating the vertical space?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the tower as the dominant vertical structure in the composition, standing significantly taller than any surrounding elements, which are mostly low landscape patterns or decorative motifs. This prominence is accentuated by the vertical tapering feature, making it not only the central element but also vertically dominant within the spatial confines of the image.",
