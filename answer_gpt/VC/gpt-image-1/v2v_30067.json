      "question": "Is the clock face present with Roman numerals I through XII arranged in a circle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the clock face is clearly visible and is designed with Roman numerals ranging from I to XII arranged in a circular fashion, which is typical for many traditional clock designs. This arrangement helps indicate time by positioning the numbers evenly around the clock dial.",

      "question": "Is the clock face located directly above the central arched opening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the clock face is positioned directly above a large central arched opening, which appears to be a prominent architectural feature of the tower. This placement is typical for clock towers, as it provides visibility for the clock dial and allows it to be a focal point of the structure.",

      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the top of the tower feature a pointed gable with finials at each corner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top structure of Image B consists of a pointed gable, which is a triangular architectural element often used in church towers and similar buildings to add height and distinction. Additionally, there are finials at each corner of this pointed structure, which are ornamental features that enhance the overall aesthetic and help emphasize the tower's silhouette.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there two arched windows on the left and right sides of the tower, positioned symmetrically below the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two arched windows symmetrically positioned below the clock face, enhancing the architectural balance of the tower. These windows, one on each side of the central arched opening, contribute to the vertical symmetry and aesthetic appeal of the tower.",

      "question": "Is the undamaged stone surface of the tower uniformly light gray with visible cracks and rough texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone surface of the tower appears uniformly smooth and light-colored without visible cracks or rough texture. The fa√ßade looks almost newly rendered, which contrasts with a weathered surface characterized by visible cracks and roughness. This indicates that the edited version has a pristine finish.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there an intact arched opening directly above the clock face, forming a decorative frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no arched opening directly above the clock face. Instead, the clock is framed by a solid architectural section leading to the pointed gable at the top of the tower, creating a coherent vertical design. The decorative features together enhance the symmetry and completeness of the form.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the tower with a tall and narrow vertical profile consisting of distinct horizontal divisions. These divisions correspond to architectural segments typical in tower designs, providing visual breaks and structural reinforcement along the height of the tower.",
