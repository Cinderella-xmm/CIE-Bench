    "Question": "Q6: Is the child’s gaze directed toward the tablet on the table?",
    "explanation": "Image B illustrates the figure in a static pose holding a device resembling a tablet. Although it is holding it directly rather than having its gaze toward a separate tablet, the intended depiction in simplified toy form generally represents focus directed at the device.",

}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is there a black tablet placed on a small wooden table in front of the child?",
