      "question": "Are the child’s eyes almond-shaped with dark brown irises and a visible light reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object appears to have been designed in the style of an animated figure or toy commonly known as a 'chibi.' Characters in this style typically include large, round eyes rather than almond-shaped eyes. The eyes in Image B are notably large and circular, characteristic of this design style. Therefore, they are not almond-shaped.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the child’s hair light brown and styled in a low ponytail with loose strands around the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited figure's hair is styled as a low ponytail, consistent with common portrayals of simple hairstyles. The color of the hair appears to be light brown, similar to brown tones seen in hair styling. Loose strands around the face are not particularly detailed in such chibi toy designs; however, the style implies casualness.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the child wear a short-sleeved, rust-colored t-shirt with a round neckline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The attire in Image B appears to be a rust-colored t-shirt with short sleeves as commonly outlined in simple animated toy clothing design. The neckline is round, fitting within typical casual clothing styles.",

      "question": "Are the child’s pants blue denim jeans?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pants in Image B exhibit a blue hue consistent with blue denim jeans. The simplified design and color align with common representations of blue jeans in figure designs.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the child sitting cross-legged with her hands clasped between her knees?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The toy in Image B shows the child-like figure sitting cross-legged as typical for such animated or figurine depictions, which often include hands clasped between the knees for stability and aesthetic appeal.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the child’s gaze directed toward the tablet on the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the figure in a static pose holding a device resembling a tablet. Although it is holding it directly rather than having its gaze toward a separate tablet, the intended depiction in simplified toy form generally represents focus directed at the device.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a black tablet placed on a small wooden table in front of the child?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a black tablet-like object is visibly held by the toy figure itself, not placed separately on a table as depicted in Image A. Thus, the toy representation conflates holding the tablet rather than having it placed on a table.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toy is depicted without any visible shoes or footwear. Chibi toy figures often represent characters in a simplified and casual manner, indicating no shoes sometimes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "question": "Is the floor and table made of light-colored wood with visible grain patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B depicts a toy rather than an actual environment, it does not illustrate flooring or the table. Instead, the box or packaging of the toy does not feature such light-colored wood patterns relevant to an environment.",
