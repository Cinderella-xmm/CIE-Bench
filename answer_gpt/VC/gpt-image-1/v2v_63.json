      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi dolls in Image B are shown with blue pants, matching the original blue pants worn by the woman in Image A. This suggests that the color of the pants has not been altered in the edited version.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi dolls display brown hair, similar to the original hair color of the woman in Image A. This indicates that the hair color has been preserved in the transition to the chibi style.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi doll's hand is not visible on the top edge of the TV, whereas in Image A, the woman's hand clearly rests there. This lack of a similar depiction in the chibi version indicates a change in hand placement.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the background wall appears consistent in its off-white color. This lack of variation suggests that the wall retains its plain off-white characteristic.",
