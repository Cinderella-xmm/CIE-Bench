    "Question": "Q3: Does the water surface reflect the orange-red gradient of the sky, creating shimmering patterns that mirror the sunset?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the water surface displays a visually distinct blend of colors that mirror the warm tones of the sunset sky, with reflections creating a dynamic shimmering effect typical of water under sunset lighting conditions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
