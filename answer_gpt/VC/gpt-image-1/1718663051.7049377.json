      "question": "Is there exactly one tree positioned in the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe a tree that is positioned centrally within a stylized stained glass design. The tree is the focus of the artwork, depicted prominently in the center. World knowledge about stained glass art indicates that central positioning often signifies importance, which supports the observation. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is exactly one tree positioned in the center of the image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the tree have a clearly defined layered canopy structure with multiple horizontal tiers of foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tree in Image B is depicted with branches that spread out horizontally in distinct layers, which is common in stylized representations, particularly in stained glass. The visual presentation creates a structured appearance resembling multiple horizontal tiers of foliage. This description matches the criteria of a tree having a clearly defined layered canopy structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the tree positioned in front of the mountain range in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree is depicted in front of the background landscape, which includes mountains. The tree is the primary subject, and mountains are rendered behind it, consistent with the visual tradition where a central object like a tree is foregrounded against a backdrop. This indicates the tree is indeed positioned in front of the mountain range.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible shadow extending from the base of the tree onto the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which is designed as a stained glass representation, there is no realistic depiction of lighting effects such as shadows. The image is composed of color blocks typical of stained glass, without gradient or shadow effects. Therefore, no shadow from the tree onto the ground is depicted.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a flat grassy plain beneath the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses the stained glass art form characterized by large colored panels to depict the scene. The ground area beneath the tree is segmented into angular panels, representing terrain. While each panel represents grass, the style does not clearly show a flat plain but rather a stylized, segmented grassy area. This does not precisely match the description of a flat grassy plain.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there mountains visible in the background behind the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B, designed in stained glass style, includes stylized geometric shapes that suggest a mountain range. The segmented nature and positioning of the colored panels are used to illustrate mountains behind the central tree. This confirms the presence of mountains in the background.",
