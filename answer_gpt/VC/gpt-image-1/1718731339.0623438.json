      "question": "Are the two prominent curved horns on top of the helmet still present and retaining their original shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the faceplate still skull-shaped with clearly visible, glowing red eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the faceplate does not resemble a skull design with glowing red eyes. Instead, any facial detail is obscured due to a deliberate blurring effect, significantly changing its appearance compared to a possible skull shape in Image A.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoulder pauldrons have transitioned into a more streamlined design that lacks the clear, aggressive spikes and the intricate red vein-like patterns evident in Image A. Instead, the structure is more decorative rather than menacing.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chest armor appears more uniform and less mechanical, lacking the detailed rivets and joints that give a mechanical and layered appearance seen in Image A. This suggests a stylistic shift from mechanical to a more monolithic design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gauntlets have a more ornamental and solid appearance. They do not have the sharp, pointed fingers characteristic of clawed gauntlets as seen in Image A, indicating a design change.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armor has a cleaner, polished appearance with a consistent texture throughout, lacking the weathered and scarred details observed in Image A. This shows a visual shift to a more uniform finish without signs of wear.",
