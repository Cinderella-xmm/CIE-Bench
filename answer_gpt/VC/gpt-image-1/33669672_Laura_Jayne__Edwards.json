      "question": "Is the background a solid turquoise color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to be a consistent and uniform turquoise color. This is determined by observing that there are no visible variations, patterns, or objects disrupting the color across the entire backdrop. Turquoise is a shade commonly associated with a mix of blue and green, which matches what is seen in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors teal, red, pink, white, and black present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dominant color of the background is turquoise. The sculpture itself is represented by a bronze-like color that doesn’t distinctly match teal, red, pink, white, or black. The image's color palette mostly consists of bronze-like and turquoise tones. Therefore, these specific colors are not prominently featured.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the subject in a diagonal stance with the right arm extended forward and the left leg behind?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is depicted as a sculpture with its right arm extended forward and the left leg positioned diagonally behind. This is observed through the pose resembling a dynamic motion, often seen in dance or athletic stances, where the limbs create angles suggestive of movement in a particular direction.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there decorative elements attached to the boots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's boots do not have any additional ornamental or decorative elements visible. The boots appear sleek and uniformly bronze without any attached objects or accessories, contrasting with any expectation of decoration.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the boots have high heels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boots of the sculpture feature high heels. This is evident from the sharp elevation at the back of the boot, designed to elevate the heel above the toe, a defining characteristic of high-heeled footwear, which is apparent even in sculptural representations.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there bracelets on the subject’s wrists?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture shows a bracelet-like band around the subject's wrist, suggesting the presence of bracelets. This is verified upon viewing the wrist, where the arm is decorated with bands which often resemble the form and placement of bracelets.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the subject have long black hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture's depiction does not include any detailed rendering of black hair. Instead, it features a streamlined form where the hair is styled in a ponytail sculpted similarly to bronze with no indication of natural colors such as black. Hence, the flowing ponytail does not match the specific characteristic of 'long black hair'.",
