      "question": "Does the locomotive retain its green color and the \"ROVES 1621\" label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the locomotive is still green, and the label on the front reads 'REVES' instead of 'ROVES.' The numbers are not clearly visible. Based on my knowledge of trains, this suggests an intentional edit to a different label. Therefore, the original label has been altered.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train remains on the tracks, and its orientation indicates it is moving towards the observer. The perspective of the train, aligned with the tracks and capturing its frontal view, confirms this direction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a group of people standing on the platform, positioned near the stationary train. By analyzing their posture and placement, we can confirm that a group of people remains on the platform.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the long shadows and the warm quality of light suggest that it is either late afternoon or early evening. This is typically characteristic of the time of day when the sun is lower in the sky, which creates the observed shadow angles and lighting ambiance.",
