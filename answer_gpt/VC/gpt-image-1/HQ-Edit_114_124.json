    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the recognizable coastline shape of North and South America, including the Gulf of Mexico and the narrow isthmus of Central America?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the map appears to depict the continent shapes of North and South America in a recognizable way. This includes the Gulf of Mexico and the narrow connection of Central America. The coastline shape is clear enough to identify these geographic features based on their typical representation in cartography and maps.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the latitude and longitude grid lines still visible or clearly implied in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the map shows faint or stylized grid lines that seem to imply the presence of latitude and longitude lines characteristic of older styled maps. Although they might not be as explicitly defined as in modern maps, the presence of such lines is suggested through the grid pattern.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the aged parchment texture, including stains and discoloration, preserved in the background of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses colors and shading that suggest an aged texture similar to parchment paper. This includes browns and beiges that imply wear and an antique look, characteristic of old maps or documents that have been weathered and stained over time.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the original sepia, gold, and green tones preserved as the dominant color palette in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B primarily utilizes sepia tones for the map and other elements, with gold hues for embellishments and green for minor accents. This maintains a similar color palette seen in traditional or vintage navigation and exploration-themed imagery.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are at least two of the original handwritten script labels or ship illustrations visibly present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, although the design elements reflect exploration themes, specific handwritten script labels and ship illustrations from the original image are not distinctly present. The focus is more on the overall theme rather than preserving these specific details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the transformed compass (now a ship’s wheel) retain the golden metallic finish and intricate engraved patterns seen in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the compass is replaced by a ship’s wheel. It retains a similar golden finish and appearance of intricacy typical to navigational tools used in exploration. The metallic look is consistent with luxury and historical artifact styling as seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the map oriented such that North remains at the top of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presentation of the map suggests standard map orientation with North positioned at the top, in line with conventional depictions of cartography.",
