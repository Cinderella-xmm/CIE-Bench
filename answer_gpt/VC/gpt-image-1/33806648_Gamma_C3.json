      "question": "Is the fallen log still present in the foreground, lying diagonally across the cave floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is primarily on the large dragon-like creature, and no fallen log is visible in the scene. The area where a fallen log might have been present is covered by the creature or altered due to the creature's presence. Comparing to Image A where the log is present, Image B does not show any signs of it. Thus, based on visual analysis, the log has been removed or obscured.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does sunlight still enter from the arch opening and illuminate the right side of the cave interior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an overall warm illumination inside the cave due to the light emanating from the dragon-like creature, but it lacks distinct sunlight illuminating the right side as it did in Image A. Instead, the light seems more diffused across the scene. The source of light inside appears to come more from the creature rather than external sunlight entering from the arch.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the rocky, uneven ground surface visible beneath the arch and extending toward the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the large creature dominates the scene, the rocky, uneven ground surface is still discernible beneath the arch extending slightly towards the foreground. This characteristic of the cave floor remains consistent with Image A despite alterations within the image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bright sky and distant tree-covered hillside still visible through the arch opening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a dragon-like creature with significant focus on its presence; however, through the arch opening, a small portion of the bright sky and the silhouette of a distant tree-covered hillside can still be perceived. These elements are consistent with what's seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the cave interior structured with converging rock walls and a clear path leading toward the arch opening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the appearance of the large creature in Image B, the caveâ€™s basic structure with converging rock walls remains. A path leading toward the arch can still be inferred from the visible layout and orientation, similar to Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the surrounding rock walls still composed of layered sedimentary rock with natural weathering patterns and beige-to-brown coloration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surrounding rock walls in Image B maintain the same appearance as in Image A, with clearly layered sedimentary rock showing natural weathering patterns and beige-to-brown coloration. These characteristics remain unchanged and are visually consistent across both images.",
