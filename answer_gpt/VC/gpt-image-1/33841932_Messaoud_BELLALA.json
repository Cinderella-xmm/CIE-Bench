    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the curved, tapering silhouette of the central golden skyscraper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central bookmark has a curved and tapering silhouette resembling the unique structure of the skyscraper visible in Image A. This suggests attention to retaining key design features. By observing the golden and curved shape, we can conclude that it reflects the tapering silhouette of the original building.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the sharp, asymmetrical top of the leftmost skyscraper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bookmark on the far left in Image B reflects the sharp and asymmetrical top of the corresponding skyscraper in Image A. The visual similarity in the angular and pointed design helps confirm this retention.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the stepped, rectangular form of the building next to the central tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In comparing Image B to Image A, the second bookmark from the left does not exhibit a stepped, rectangular form but rather appears more streamlined without distinct steps. The buildings in Image A show definite steps in their design, which are not mirrored in the bookmark.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the vertical light strip pattern on the right-side skyscraper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The right-most bookmark in Image B does have patterns resembling light strips, yet they are more generalized and do not distinctly replicate the vertical strip patterns observed on the skyscraper in Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the bookmark preserve the height-to-width ratio and tapering proportion of the central skyscraper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central bookmark in Image B maintains a similar tapering proportion and height-to-width ratio as seen in the central skyscraper in Image A. This is suggested through the elongated and narrow design, reflecting the proportions of the original structure.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the wider base of the central skyscraper compared to its upper section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bookmark does not prominently display a noticeable wider base compared to the upper section, unlike the central skyscraper in Image A, where a discernible variation in width between the base and the top is visible. Therefore, this particular feature is not retained.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the red buoy present in the final image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, representing the bookmarks, there is no presence of elements such as a red buoy, which is a distinct feature visible in Image A's foreground. Thus, the buoy is absent in the final image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
    }
