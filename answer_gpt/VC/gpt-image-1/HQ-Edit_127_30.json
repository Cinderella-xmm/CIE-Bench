      "question": "Are the two symmetrical f-hole shapes present on the body of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object depicted in the edited image does not have any visible f-hole shapes typically found on the body of a violin. Instead, the body has a solid appearance without the characteristic sound holes. This conclusion is reached by analyzing the surface of the object's body, which lacks the cutouts or openings that f-holes would create, and noting the design focus on other aesthetic elements instead.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the scroll with four tuning pegs located at the top end of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top part of the object in Image B does not feature a scroll or tuning pegs, which are typical characteristics of a violin. Instead, the top end has a smooth, continuous shape without the winding scroll or protrusions that would indicate the presence of tuning pegs. This observation helps conclude that the object is stylized or modified from the traditional violin structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the object retain the classic violin silhouette with distinct upper and lower bouts and a central waist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an object that maintains the overall contour of a violin, including the upper and lower bouts and a slender waist, which collectively form the quintessential violin silhouette. Despite possible artistic modifications or embellishments, the fundamental outline mirrors that of a classic violin, assisting in identifying the shape based on common violin structural features.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a clearly defined bridge area located between the two f-holes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no clearly defined bridge area present, as the object does not feature f-holes. The absence of f-holes implies that there is no intermediate point between them for a bridge to be positioned as traditionally seen in violins. The object's design focuses on other aesthetic or structural elements that do not include a traditional bridge section.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the object positioned diagonally across the support surface, with the scroll pointing toward the upper right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B is positioned upright on a stand rather than diagonally across the surface. The absence of a scroll on the object and its vertical placement indicate that it does not follow a diagonal orientation typical of how a violin might be displayed. The analysis focuses on its alignment with the visible axis of the support surface, confirming its upright stance instead.",
