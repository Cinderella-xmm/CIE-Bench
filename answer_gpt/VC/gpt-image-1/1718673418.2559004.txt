    "Question": "Q1: Is the elevated rocky outcrop forming the base of the island still present with its original silhouette and position?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scene depicts an imaginative setting characterized by giant mushrooms with houses sheltered beneath them.

    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the houses arranged in a dense, tiered cluster ascending the slope of the island?",
