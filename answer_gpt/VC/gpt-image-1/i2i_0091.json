      "question": "Is the original lighting style, including the placement and intensity of shadows, preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting in the cathedral-like hallway is dramatic and accentuates the architecture with shadows cast by the window grid pattern onto the floor. The shadows are prominent, suggesting strong, direct lighting. To compare, analyzing Image A, the lighting is also natural but characterized by softer shadows due to the broader light source from the side windows, typical of a contemporary interior setting. Given these differences in lighting style, particularly the intensity and placement of shadows, the lighting style has not been preserved between the two images.",

      "question": "Are the items on the chest of drawers arranged in a similar fashion to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on the hallway's architecture rather than furniture arrangement. Image A features a contemporary styled chest of drawers with decor such as vases and books placed on it. Image B does not have a comparable piece of furniture with items arranged similarly; instead, it has benches and wooden chairs in alignment with the wall. Thus, there is no similarity in the arrangement of items on a chest of drawers.",

      "question": "Is the wooden parquet flooring texture still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stone or tile flooring typical of a hallway in historic or ecclesiastic architecture, without the characteristic wooden texture. In contrast, Image A has a clear display of wooden parquet flooring, identifiable by its pattern and texture. Therefore, the edited image does not retain the wooden parquet flooring texture.",

      "question": "Is there a large piece of furniture serving as the primary storage unit in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the furniture present consists of benches and chairs without any large storage functionalities. In Image A, the prominent feature is a chest of drawers used for storage. Since Image B lacks a similar storage unit and instead has seating furniture, there is no large piece serving as the primary storage unit.",

      "question": "Is natural light still illuminating the scene from the same direction as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, natural light streams in from the left side through tall windows, casting patterned shadows across the floor, indicative of morning or afternoon light. Image A also shows light entering from the left, but through a more domestic-sized window, casting different shadows. While both images have light sourcing from the left, the type and intensity of light differ. However, since the direction is the same, the natural light direction remains unchanged.",
