    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image depict exactly eight arms extending from the central head mass?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, we observe a series of sculptures that resemble octopus tentacles but separate from a central mass, totaling six arms. Since the question asks if there are eight arms, the image clearly shows absence of exactly eight arms. In Image A, the original octopus has the expected eight arms. Thus, the edited image does not depict eight arms.",
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a distinct, rounded central head mass from which all arms originate?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals several standalone tentacle-like sculptures without a central head mass. This contrasts Image A, where a clear central head mass is seen from which all arms originate. Therefore, Image B lacks the presence of a central head mass.",
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the arms exhibit a flowing, undulating arrangement that mirrors the wave patterns of the original ocean scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sculptures display a smooth, curled form rather than the dynamic, flowing arrangement of the octopus arms in Image A. The wave-like patterns of Image A are dynamic, while Image B showcases rigid, static sculptures. Therefore, Image B does not mirror the wave pattern of Image A's ocean scene.",
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there visible surface textures on the sculptures that mimic the original skin's ridges and suction cup patterns?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows sculptures with surface textures, resembling some ridged patterns. However, the detailed suction cups evident in Image A's octopus are not visible in Image B. This indicates the absence of a fully mimicked texture from the original octopus.",
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the sculpture maintain the same general silhouette and proportional relationship between the head and arms as the original octopus?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts freestanding tentacle sculptures without a proportionate central mass or the same silhouette as Image A's octopus, which shows a unified head and arms structure forming a proportionate silhouette. As such, Image B doesn't preserve the same silhouette or proportions.",
    "answer": "No"
