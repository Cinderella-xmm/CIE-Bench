      "question": "Is the rooster’s comb present on top of its head in a prominent, upright position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rooster features a comb that is bright red and prominently positioned on top of its head. This is typical for a rooster and is characteristic of the species’ anatomy. The comb has an upright stance, making it a noticeable feature. The conclusion is drawn from these visual characteristics combined with knowledge of rooster anatomy.",

      "question": "Are the red fleshy wattles visible under the rooster’s beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beneath the rooster's beak, there are noticeable red fleshy wattles, which are common features in roosters, serving as a distinctive anatomical element. These wattles are prominently visible, suggesting their presence below the beak area.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The beak in Image B is clearly shown at the front of the rooster's face. It has a pointed tip, which is typical for birds such as roosters, used for pecking and feeding. The position and shape are consistent with common knowledge of bird anatomy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the rooster have two legs with three forward-facing toes and one rear toe on each foot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the rooster with two visible legs. These legs are anatomically accurate, each featuring three forward-facing toes and one rear-facing toe, consistent with typical rooster leg structure. This observation is backed by visual cues of the legs and toes visible in the image.",

      "question": "Is the rooster standing on a dark gray asphalt surface with visible debris such as leaves and small plant fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the rooster standing against a dark background, but it's more artistic and abstract, not detailed and textured like an asphalt surface. This abstract style lacks visible debris such as leaves or plant fragments. Given the fantastical artistic elements, it's not reasonable to conclude the background is a literal gray asphalt surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rooster is depicted in a proud stance, head upright and slightly raised, which indicates an alert posture. While the artistic style makes the position of the feet less explicit, the body posture suggests one foot is slightly forward inherent in such artistic depictions.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the rooster with an elaborate tail flowing with visual dynamics, extending from the rear of the rooster’s body and curving dramatically upwards. The tail features characteristic rooster aesthetics even within its artistically exaggerated style.",
