    "Question": "Q1: Is the man's left arm still wrapped around the woman's back, supporting her in a ballroom dance hold?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the man's entire left arm is visible, and it is positioned at a more formal upright posture typical in historical or classical dance depictions, resting at the waist level rather than wrapping around the woman's back for support.

This reflects an older style of dance where the hold focuses on maintaining grace and formality.",

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the man's left foot forward and the woman's right heel raised off the ground?",
