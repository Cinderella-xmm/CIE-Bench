      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gnome is depicted with a beard that appears to be vertically striated, which means it has lines running downwards, giving it texture and fullness from the chin to the chest area. This style of beard is characteristic of the traditional depiction of gnomes.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gnome is shown in a standing position rather than a seated one, as indicated by the fact that it is holding items and standing on a surface.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no emphasis on footwear, as the gnome is depicted in a standing position amidst boxes labeled 'seed packet' and holds objects in its hands. The focus is on its actions rather than detailing its footwear, which means the description does not visibly include round boots with stitching.",

      "explanation": "Image B depicts the gnome in a warm, sandy color palette, common in illustrations and artwork. The texture is added artistically, but it is not uniformly represented as textured variations. Rather, the image's design is stylized to match the overall thematic elements of garden gnomes.",
