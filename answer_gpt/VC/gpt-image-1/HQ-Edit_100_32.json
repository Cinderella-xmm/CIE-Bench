      "question": "Is the Olympus brand name visible on the top of the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera shows the name 'OLYM' on top instead of the full 'Olympus' name. Focusing on visual cues, it seems partially obscured or intentionally abbreviated, possibly due to artistic style adjustments made for the edited image. Image A clearly shows the full name 'Olympus'. Through this logical deduction, we conclude the brand name is not fully visible in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera has a distinct large circular lens depicted in the front, highlighting the central focus feature typical of cameras. Image A also shows a prominent circular lens at the center. Thus, both images feature a large lens, and recognizing this component of cameras, it is clear such a lens is present in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two hands gripping the camera body, one hand around the lens and the other around the edge of the camera, mirroring typical hand placements for holding a camera. Image A similarly has both hands on the camera. Using visual cues, both hands are indeed depicted holding the camera in Image B, much like in the original image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a brown strap that runs from the camera, suggesting it extends upwards and over the shoulder, characteristic of typical camera straps. In Image A, the strap is clearly visible, confirming its presence. Comparison clarifies this feature remains similar, showing the strap in Image B.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts two flap pockets on the front of the denim jacket, positioned symmetrically, which is typical of denim jackets. Image A also has similar pockets. Based on this consistent characteristic, both images reflect similar design features of the jacket.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white blouse is illustrated with vertical lines, indicative of ridges or pleats, which is again evident in Image A. Recognizing attributes of formal blouses, these visual lines point to pleats in both images.",
