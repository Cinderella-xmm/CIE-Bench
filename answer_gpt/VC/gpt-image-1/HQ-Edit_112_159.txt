    "Question": "Q1: Does the car retain the distinctive angular LED headlights and central grille intake characteristic of the McLaren 720S?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the car resembles the McLaren style with angular designs but is incorporated into a small display or model, making definitive identification challenging. The headlights appear as stylized elements consistent with hyper-realistic or model depictions, lacking the sharp definition of actual McLaren headlights. Without clear angular LED headlights and the central grille intake visible due to scale and stylization, these features are more representative rather than definitive of a McLaren 720S.",
