    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the dress shown with clearly defined, flowing fabric folds that cascade from the shoulder down to the floor and pool on the windowsill?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress has visible folds that suggest the concept of flowing fabric, but it appears more stylized and simplified compared to realistic depiction. In the context of Image B, the fabric does not cascade naturally to the floor nor pool on the windowsill, which matches more with a stylized illustration rather than real. Based on this analysis, the stylization simplifies these elements, initiating a visual disconnect between flowing motion and rigid form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the window frame and surrounding border decorated with organic, swirling floral patterns and gentle arches characteristic of Art Nouveau design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B depict swirling floral patterns along the edges of the background design, conforming to the ornamental and gentle arches typical of Art Nouveau style. This artistic movement is known for its organic elements and curved lines, both of which are explicitly presented in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a small vase with pale yellow flowers and green leaves positioned on the windowsill to the left of the woman?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a depiction of a vase with stylized floral arrangements to the left of the woman. The flowers appear simplified and part of the illustration art style rather than being three-dimensional objects. Thus, both criteria of arrangement and specific coloring match.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dominant colors in Image B can be identified as soft pastels, involving hues like cream, off-white, muted golden tones, and greens. This color palette is uniformly applied across various elements including the dress, background, and decorative sections, maintaining consistency.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's posture appears upright, maintaining a formal stance typical of portraiture or illustration without a significant forward lean. She does not exhibit a downward gaze or a prominent position towards the left side, illustrating a more neutral posture.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observation, Image B lacks a figure visible through the illustration background. The design elements are stylized, focusing on decorative patterns without any additional ghostly appearances or figures discernible.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration in Image B demonstrates a style devoid of natural lighting effects, focusing instead on color density and flat shading typical of this artistic depiction. Therefore, typical lighting attributes such as diffusion or shadow elements aren't visibly present in the design integrity of the illustration.",
