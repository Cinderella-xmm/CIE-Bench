      "question": "Is the number \"1423\" clearly visible on the front of the train?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the train is stylized in a pop art fashion with bold colors and outlines. The number '1423' is prominently displayed in blue on a yellow background on the front of the train. The use of contrasting colors makes the number stand out clearly against the design, making it clearly visible. The positioning is typical for identifying numbers on trains, reinforcing the clear display of the number.",

      "question": "Does the train have two circular headlights below a central white circular light on its front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the train is illustrated with a pop art style, using distinct and bold shapes. The image shows two small yellow circular shapes that represent headlights placed symmetrically on either side of the train's front. There is also a large black circular shape which is positioned centrally, representing a light, but it's not white as described. This setup suggests a representation intended to depict multiple lights, similar to a typical train setup.",

      "question": "Are there multiple vertical rows of white-framed windows on the side of the barn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the side of the barn is depicted with repetitive rectangular shapes outlined in black, filled with yellow, suggestive of windows. The arrangement mimics vertical rows which could represent window panes. Utilizing pop art colors (red, blue, yellow) emphasizes the contrast, but the pattern and arrangement betray the intention of representing multiple windows in a stylized manner. This pattern aligns with the traditional appearance of farm buildings having rows of windows.",

      "question": "Are there two large wooden doors centered on the lower part of the barn’s front facade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the barn is illustrated in a colorful and stylized manner. There is no distinct representation of large wooden doors on the lower part of the barn’s front facade. The focus is on using geometric shapes and bold colors, which may abstract these details. In a pop art representation, simplicity and abstraction often replace detailed structures like doors; hence, no large doors are visible in the illustration.",

      "question": "Do the railway tracks extend forward from under the train and curve gently to the right into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the railway tracks are stylized with strong black outlines, yellow and blue stripes running parallel, representing tracks. They extend forward from under the train and visibly continue straight into the distance, without any indication of a curve to the right. Pop art style abstracts and omits curves, showcasing linear elements predominantly.",

      "question": "Is the yellow triangular warning sign with a blue border and the \"50\" speed limit sign visible near the track on the left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of a yellow triangular warning sign with a blue border or a '50' speed limit sign near the tracks on the left side. The focus is on bold, vibrant elements without intricate signage details, typical in stylized pop art where practical elements are often abstracted or omitted.",

      "question": "Is the train positioned directly on the railway tracks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train is visually placed atop the railway tracks with bold, defining lines, maintaining the visual narrative of a train moving along tracks. The pop art stylization maintains the logical layout and spatial relation of the train staying on the tracks, essential for depicting movement and direction in a simplified form.",
