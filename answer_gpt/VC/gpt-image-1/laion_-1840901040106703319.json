      "question": "Are the three triangular windows positioned at the apex of the A-frame roof clearly present and maintaining their triangular shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the architecture is dominated by a blue crystalline structure, where the upper section's design still indicates the presence of triangular elements at the apex, resembling windows similar to an A-frame roof style. These visually stand out as triangular due to their location at the peak and their form, which aligns with common architectural elements of this style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the cabin structured with a raised deck on the upper level and a garage on the lower level, maintaining the same vertical separation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystalline structure clearly shows an upper level with an outdoor balcony-like feature, indicative of a raised deck. The lower level seems to be less emphasized for functionality like a garage in traditional sense due to the artistic crystalline aesthetic, but it maintains the appearance of being a separate level distinct from the upper level, thus maintaining vertical separation visually.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the garage door located on the right side of the lower level, adjacent to the main entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's design replaces traditional elements with stylized crystalline features, and there is no visible element akin to a garage door in the typical sense. Therefore, in the context of typical architectural features, the garage door as identifiable in Image A, located at the right, is no longer distinct or present in that form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the cabin symmetric about its central vertical axis, with the roof peak, main entrance, and supporting columns aligned centrally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image presents a symmetric crystalline structure about the central axis, which is typical of symmetrical architectural designs. The apex of the roof, the apparent central entrance, and the visual alignment of structural elements suggest that symmetry is maintained.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the vertical support columns beneath the deck present and positioned at regular intervals along the front facade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the crystalline structure of Image B, the vertical elements that might correspond to support columns are present and seem to be regularly positioned along the front, reinterpreted in the artistic crystalline style, thus illustrating a form of continuity with traditional supporting columns.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the small rectangular window located on the lower level, to the left of the main entrance, still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a highly stylized crystalline form with no clear depiction of a small rectangular window. Although there are multifaceted surfaces resembling windows, the specific small rectangular window next to the entrance typical in Image A does not appear evident.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the stone retaining wall made of large, irregular boulders visible on the right side of the cabin's base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystalline structure in Image B does not show a stone retaining wall. Instead, it appears as though the crystalline and marble base design replaces any natural stonework that was present in Image A, removing the visual indications of a stone retaining wall.",
