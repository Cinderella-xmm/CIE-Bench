      "question": "Is the pink flamingo-shaped mug with a white beak and curved neck present in the same position relative to the cereal bars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flamingo mug with a curved neck and white beak is depicted as a cartoon character with smiley features, interacting with the cereal bars. In Image A, this mug maintains its same position relative to the cereal bars. By recognizing its unique shape and position, I deduce the mug's relative positioning remains unchanged.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the words \"freee\" and \"corn flakes\" visible on the cereal box, along with the bird logo above the brand name?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cereal box is illustrated in a cartoon style with 'Charming Cereal Creations' written prominently instead of 'freee' and 'corn flakes.' Thus, the brand name and logo from Image A do not appear in the edited version.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the circular illustration of a bowl filled with corn flakes visible on the front of the cereal box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a cartooned cereal box with different graphics, replacing the realistic illustration of a bowl filled with corn flakes from Image A with characters and artwork that do not include a circular illustration. Analyzing these visual differences confirms the absence of such a bowl illustration.",
      "weight": 2,

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the light-colored wooden surface visible beneath the cereal bars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cereal bars in Image B are set against illustrative graphics with no visible wooden surface. Meanwhile, Image A shows the cereal bars arranged on a light-colored wooden surface for this purpose. Comparing these backgrounds confirms the absence of a wooden surface in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the off-white wall visible in the background behind the cereal box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is filled with a stylized illustration, replacing any real setting like the off-white wall seen in Image A. This shift in the environment confirms that no off-white wall is visible in the edited image contextual space.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the pink flamingo mug positioned behind the cereal bars and to the left side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Referencing Image B, the flamingo-shaped mug is drawn with expressive elements, repositioned engagingly in a cartoon arrangement, differing from Image A where the mug sits leftmost and behind the cereal bars. The comparative alteration indicates the mug is not positioned as in the original image.",
