      "question": "Is the winged \"B\" logo visible on the rear of the vehicle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a metallic object resembling a yacht with the Bentley logo prominently displayed on its side. This is a 3D model, not a vehicle, and the logo appears as part of its design. Analyzing Image A, the winged 'B' logo is visible on the rear of the actual Bentley vehicle. Since Image B depicts a different object entirely, there is no winged 'B' logo on the rear of a vehicle in this image.",

      "question": "Is the \"BENTLEY GREENWICH\" text visible on the rear license plate area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object takes the form of a metallic yacht, with no license plate area visible because it is not a vehicle. In Image A, the vehicle shows 'BENTLEY GREENWICH' clearly on the rear license plate area. The discrepancy in object types means there is no corresponding text in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the vehicle retain a silver metallic color as its primary surface tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a silver metallic object that resembles a yacht, rather than a vehicle, but its primary surface tone is indeed silver metallic. Image A displays a vehicle with a silver metallic color. Since Image B's primary surface is silver metallic, the analogy for this quality is maintained.",

      "question": "Is there a continuous chrome trim line visible along the lower side of the vehicle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no visible vehicle with a chrome trim in Image B, as it displays a metallic yacht-like object without features typical of a vehicle, such as trim lines. Image A's vehicle shows a discernible chrome trim along the lower side. As Image B is not a vehicle, this feature is absent.",

      "question": "Is the vehicle displayed on a circular black platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object shaped like a yacht is not displayed on any platform; it stands alone with a basic background. In Image A, the vehicle is placed on a circular black platform. Since Image B does not feature a platform, such a setup is absent.",
