      "question": "Is the fountain located at the exact center of the garden layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fountain is prominent but not centered; it is positioned towards the center but slightly off due to the presence of two mystical tree figures that dominate the garden's symmetry. The fountain's location supports a harmonious layout but does not follow a strict centrism commonly found in traditional garden designs. By examining the garden's design logic, its off-centering fits within the more fantastical elements introduced.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the hedges and flowerbeds form a symmetrical radial pattern centered on the fountain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the garden’s hedges and flowers seem to form a symmetrical radial pattern similar to structured designs observed in gardens. While more mystical in appearance, the logical placement of hedges accommodates the fountain’s ambiance, adhering to typical symmetry focused on a central water feature used in garden designs.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there an arched gateway at the far end of the central path, aligned with the fountain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the layout has been transformed into a mystical scene. The garden entrance is decorated with magical figures, and no visible arched gateway is aligned with the fountain along a central path. The removal of typical gateways aligns with the edited image’s ethereal theme.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a magical setting without any traditional houses visible. The contrasting visual style and absence of architectural features like thatched roofs or chimneys suggest a different narrative approach, omitting residential structures and focusing on the fantastical elements within the garden itself.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, pink roses are indeed clustered prominently in the immediate foreground, closest to the viewer. This arrangement draws the viewer's eye first, highlighting a vibrant entrance to the garden area and adding vivid color to the mystical scene.",

        "No"
      ],

      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible arrangement of purple lavender forming a ring around the fountain. The fantastical elements and changed focus nearby the fountain exclude such cohesive traditional garden setups, maintaining a mystical design instead.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entrance is more magical and lacks traditional topiary landscaping. The focus has shifted towards tree-spirits, circumventing the standard garden signage like cone-shaped trees, typically used to mark garden entrances.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the image is depicted in a fantastical, ethereal setting devoid of a visible horizon line. The background has transformed into a mystical scene, prioritizing swirling energy and magical ambiance, which avoids traditional landscape elements such as a horizon line.",
