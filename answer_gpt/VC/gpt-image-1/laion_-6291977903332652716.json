      "question": "Are the dark wooden beams forming geometric patterns on the facades of the buildings clearly visible and structurally accurate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings are depicted within a glass ball as a miniature representation of the structures in Image A. The dark wooden beams on the building in Image B create a clear, distinguishable pattern typical of half-timbered construction. They form geometric shapes and are placed logically to support the structure, which is common in traditional European architecture. Given this accurate miniature representation, the wooden beams are indeed structurally accurate and visible.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the buildings feature steeply pitched gabled roofs with dormer windows positioned at regular intervals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents miniature representations of the buildings, but no detailed depiction of dormer windows is evident in this portrayal. The roof structures appear simplified for the miniature effect, and there aren't visible dormer windows as there are in the original Image A. While the roofs have a basic A-frame or gable appearance, the regular dormer windows as seen in traditional structures (like those in Image A) are missing.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a pedestrian bridge spanning the canal in the mid-ground, connecting the two sides of the street?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature depiction includes a small pedestrian bridge connecting the two sides of the canal, consistent with the real-life setting shown in Image A. The bridge is evident in the center of this miniature as a connecting element matching the placement in the real scenery from Image A, thus accurately representing it.",

      "question": "Does the canal surface reflect the surrounding buildings and sky with clear, mirror-like fidelity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the canal within the glass ball does not capture detailed reflections as seen in Image A. The water's surface in the miniature is not rendered to reflect the surroundings with mirror-like clarity; it is more solid and opaque due to the artistic style of the miniature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there flower boxes containing green plants visible along the balcony of the large building on the right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a simplified version of the buildings where intricate details like flower boxes are not prominently visible. Unlike Image A, which clearly shows flower boxes with greenery, the miniature effect focuses more on structural elements over smaller decorative details like plants.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are stone bases and metal railings present along the canal edges beneath the buildings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature adequately depicts stone bases and limited railings along the canal, capturing the architectural elements to a reasonable extent for a miniature. However, it does not explicitly show metal railings in detail, focusing instead on the broader structure representation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the windows arranged in vertical and horizontal lines on the facades, matching the timber frame divisions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, the depiction of the buildings shows windows placed in relation to the timber frame divisions. They are arranged in vertical and horizontal lines consistent with traditional design, similar to Image A. Even though it's a miniature, the arrangement maintains this recognizable structure.",
