      "question": "Is the dog depicted with a black coat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dog in Image B is shown as black, based on the visual cues indicating a dark, consistent color across its body. In animation or cartoon art style, black coloring is typically filled in uniformly to represent a black coat, confirming the dog's coat color as black.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is illustrated in a lying-down position with its legs tucked and eyes closed, suggesting a calm and relaxed demeanor. This posture is commonly associated with resting in animals, particularly dogs.",

      "question": "Is the bench depicted in green?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the bench in a dark shade that aligns with typical green coloration, often used in cartoon art for benches. The use of this color implies that the bench is intended to be green, consistent with the common depiction of outdoor bench colors.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is drawn laying down in front of the bench, but not directly beside it. Although the bench and dog share the same scene, the dog's position appears contingent or slightly distanced from the bench, not directly positioned next to it as 'next to' implies close proximity beside the bench.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays a radio, a container labeled 'Orange Juice,' and a trash bag all occupying space atop the bench. Each of these items is artistically rendered to fit on the bench, reflecting their presence there distinctly.",
