    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the three figures positioned such that one is on the left, one in the center, and one on the right from the viewer's perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the three figures depicted are arranged from left to right as observed by the viewer, creating a composition where one figure is on the left, another in the center, and the last one on the right. This arrangement is common for group portrayals, providing a balanced visual presentation.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the central figure standing fully upright with both feet on the rock and facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central figure in Image B is depicted as standing upright, with both legs grounded firmly on the rock, indicating stability and strength, commonly used in artwork to convey confidence. The figure is facing forward, a typical representation to indicate dominance or central position.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the ocean visible in the background behind the figures, with waves breaking against rocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no direct visual depiction of an ocean with waves breaking against rocks in the background. Instead, a stylized or abstract backdrop is used, which might suggest an otherworldly or epic scene but does not directly indicate a realistic oceanic landscape.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the figures standing on dark, jagged rock formations in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the figures standing on jagged structures that resemble rock formations. These elements are stylistically represented to enhance the dramatic and majestic quality of the scene, commonly seen in mythical or legend-themed art.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sun positioned directly behind the central figure, creating a bright glow between his legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure is surrounded by a radiant backdrop, but it is not explicitly designed such that a bright sun glow is precisely emanating between his legs, as the image uses dramatic sky colors as a halo around the figures.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a clear horizon line separating the sky from the ocean in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there isn't a clear demarcation or horizon line as it presents an artistic blend of colors and elements, giving a sense of depth without a realistic horizon line to distinguish between sky and ocean specifically.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the figure on the right have long, wavy hair extending past the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure on the right is stylized with a helmet or intricate headgear, consistent with a fantasy theme. Therefore, long, wavy hair is not explicitly portrayed in the artwork, as it is concealed by the armor-like attire.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Does the figure on the left have curly, light brown hair reaching past the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left figure's head is adorned with an elaborate helmet or ornate headgear, fitting the art style's theme. Hence, specific details like curly, light brown hair visible and flowing past the shoulders are not presented as in a more realistic depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
