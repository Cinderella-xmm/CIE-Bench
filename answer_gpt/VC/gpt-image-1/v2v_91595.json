      "question": "Is the \"Nikon\" logo clearly visible on the top of the camera body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Nikon' logo is prominently visible on the upper part of the camera body, precisely where it typically appears on Nikon cameras. The stylized owl design does not obstruct the logo, allowing it to be clear and distinct. Recognizing brand logos is common knowledge, and here, the logo is unmistakably displayed on the camera.",

      "question": "Is the \"Nikon D800\" text visible on the back label of the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the back part where the original label would be is now adorned with an owl design which obscures any label markings that might indicate the model name 'Nikon D800'. Thus, there is no visible text stating 'Nikon D800' on the camera.",

      "question": "Is the battery compartment door open and hinged on the left side of the camera body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a visible open compartment on the left side of the camera similar to a battery compartment. This observation aligns with how camera battery compartments are usually designed to open from one side, providing evidence that it is open and hinged appropriately.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the orange plastic tab visible inside the battery compartment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the space inside the battery compartment reveals an intricate arrangement of gears rather than a typical battery compartment structure. This unique design does not include any orange plastic tab visible, indicating a significant design alteration from standard camera equipment.",

      "question": "Is the black EN-EL3e battery partially inserted into the battery compartment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Assessing Image B, a battery-like section is present underneath the camera; however, it's characterized by mechanical gears and appears to be part of the artistic design, rather than the standard EN-EL3e battery. Thus, it is not a partially inserted EN-EL3e battery.",
      "weight": 2,

      "question": "Does the camera body retain a matte black finish across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the camera body with a dominant matte finish consistent with the appearance of standard camera materials. The embellishment with detailed owl designs doesn't alter this finish entirely but integrates within, preserving the matte black aesthetic across most of the surface.",

      "question": "Is the textured rubber grip visible on the handgrip of the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the standard location for the textured rubber grip on a camera's handgrip does not exhibit the typical visible texture seen on camera handgrips, as it's transformed by an overlay of the owl's design. This alteration conceals the conventional grip texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals the lens mount area prominently, transformed into a detailed mechanical and owl-themed configuration, including a silver metallic ring that remains centered on the front of the camera, simulating a lens mount design.",

      "question_id": "Q9",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the area where the label would traditionally exist is wholly occupied by artistic detailing with no visible space or text for a label indicating 'MADE IN JAPAN' or displaying the serial number '6003450'. The total redesign conceals any such details.",
