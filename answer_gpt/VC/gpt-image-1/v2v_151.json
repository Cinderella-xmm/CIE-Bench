        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger is depicted as a cartoonish, chibi-style character. The stripes are simplified and stylized, but they are still present. Cartoon or stylized depictions often maintain recognizable features, albeit in exaggerated or simplified forms. Despite the change in art style, the distinctive stripe pattern, characteristic of a tiger, is still visible.",

      "question": "Is the tiger still holding the skateboard in its paws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger, albeit in a chibi-style form, is depicted holding the skateboard in its paws, similar to the position seen in more realistic settings. The depiction of a character holding an object in a specific manner is often retained even in stylized versions to maintain coherence with actions or attributes. Therefore, the tiger continues to hold the skateboard.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard clearly features the yin-yang symbol on its underside. The symbolism is iconic and recognizable, making it a consistent element likely to be retained in various artistic styles to maintain thematic or narrative continuity. The yin-yang symbol is a central feature of the skateboard in both images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger is drawn wearing a cap that resembles the one in Image A. The military-style cap in Image A is detailed, while the one in Image B is simpler but retains distinctive features like a brim and a badge star, making it recognizable as the same type of cap. Simplified depictions frequently maintain key features to ensure recognition.",

      "question": "Does the tiger maintain a seated posture similar to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the tiger standing rather than seated. The artistic conversion from a realistic style to a chibi style often involves changes in posture to suit the new aesthetic, usually favoring dynamic or cute poses over static ones like sitting. The tiger in Image B does not retain the seated posture from Image A.",
