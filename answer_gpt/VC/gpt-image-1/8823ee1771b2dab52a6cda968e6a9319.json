      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine is in a static pose with one arm resting on a column, and there is no indication of the head's position due to the blurred face. The posture suggests she is in a semi-frontal pose, typical of a three-quarter stance, but the head's direction can't be reliably determined.",
