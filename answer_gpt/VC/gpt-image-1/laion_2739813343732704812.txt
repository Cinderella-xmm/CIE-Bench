    "Question": "Q1: Is there a visible gular pouch located beneath the lower mandible of the beak?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration of the pelican features a large exaggerated beak, but there is no distinct section or bulge below the lower mandible to suggest a clearly visible gular pouch. Common depictions of pelicans often emphasize their beak, and the area below the beak may be simplified or stylized in illustrations like this. Therefore, based on this stylized representation, there is no visible gular pouch beneath the lower mandible.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the feet clearly webbed with visible claws at the tips of each toe?",
    "explanation": "Image B is a cartoon illustration where the feet are stylized and simplified, showing no visible webbing or claws at the tips of each toe. The webbing and claws, typical of a real pelican, are not present in this animated style. Such illustrations often focus on expressive traits over anatomical accuracy. Thus, the illustration does not feature webbed feet with visible claws.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the feathers on the body composed of layered, striated structures with visible individual feather shafts and overlapping edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the feathers are depicted in a simplified and stylized manner, using flat colors and simple lines for detailing. There are no visible individual feather shafts or overlapping edges, as would be present in a realistic depiction. This simplified style aligns with the whimsical nature of cartoon illustrations. Therefore, the feathers are not composed of layered, striated structures.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the bird have a long neck curving down from the head to a broad, rounded body?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a cartoon pelican where the neck is relatively short and not curving. The body shape is simplified and not distinctly broad or rounded. Cartoon illustrations often modify proportions for effect, not necessarily maintaining anatomical correctness. Thus, based on the cartoon style, the bird does not have an anatomically long, curving neck leading to a broad body.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are both legs positioned under the body, supporting the pelican in a grounded standing pose?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon pelican is standing with both legs below its body, suggesting a grounded pose typical of a bird at rest. This is a common posture illustrators adopt to show stability in character poses, even though the style is simplified. So based on this depiction, both legs are indeed positioned under the body.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a single dark, round eye visible on the side of the head?",
    "explanation": "The pelican illustration in Image B exhibits large, googly eyes which are typical of animated characters. They do not resemble the singular, dark, round eye found on a real pelican; rather, they are exaggerated and stylized to enhance expressiveness. Given this representation, the pelican does not have a single dark, round eye akin to realistic depictions.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is there a small tuft of feathers raised at the crown of the head?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon pelican has a blue cap drawn at the crown of its head with no raised tuft of feathers visible. Stylized representations often introduce accessories or other elements that replace anatomical features for thematic emphasis, and here, the hat covers the area where a tuft might be. Thus, in this cartoon depiction, there is no small tuft of feathers visible.",
    "answer": "No"
