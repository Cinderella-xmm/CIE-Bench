      "question": "Is the crocodile's snout with two visible teeth present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crocodile depicted is a stylized illustration rather than a realistic representation. The snout of the crocodile in the edited image does not feature the same realistic detail as a photograph would, such as two distinct teeth visible on the snout. Instead, it's a cartoon-style design with generalized shapes and patterns. This suggests a creative take rather than a realistic depiction that includes two specific visible teeth.",

      "question": "Is the colorful knitted hat with a red pom-pom still present on the crocodile's head in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) showcases a vibrant, graphic depiction of a crocodile wearing an exaggerated and colorful hat. While it retains a playful and colorful style akin to a knitted hat, it is heavily stylized with bright colors and patterns. Despite the abstract representation, the presence of a pom-pom at the top suggests a continued depiction of a knit-style hat with a similar element.",

      "question": "Are the orange-framed sunglasses with reflective lenses still positioned over the crocodile's eyes in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon-like crocodile wears sunglasses that maintain the orange frame clearly recognizable from the original image. The reflective lenses are depicted with exaggerated reflections in bright colors that align with the artistic style of the illustration, therefore maintaining the idea of reflective lenses. The crocodile's eyes are covered by these sunglasses, confirming their presence.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the crocodile's head oriented forward with a slight leftward turn in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crocodile's head is presented in a forward-facing manner with a slight artistic tilt to the left, consistent with the style of the cartoon image. Although more abstract, it follows the orientation seen in Image A where the head is slightly turned to the left, showcasing stylization in alignment direction.",

      "question": "Is the crocodile partially submerged in water in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict any water element. The illustration opts for a flat, colorful background and foreground that do not convey any context of water. The representation focuses on patterns and colors rather than including a natural environment. Thus, there's no indication of the crocodile being partially submerged.",

      "question": "Are there reflections visible in the lenses of the sunglasses in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the lenses of the sunglasses do have artistic depictions of reflections, with vertical blue and yellow lines illustrating the reflective property. This creative choice conforms to the vibrant, stylized nature, but still aligns with the concept of reflecting something as lenses would.",
