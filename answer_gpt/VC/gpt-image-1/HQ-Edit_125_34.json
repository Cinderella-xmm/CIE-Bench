      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall behind the desk has intricate carvings and a globe display reflecting a sci-fi theme; therefore, the central wooden panel originally seen in Image A with floral and scrollwork detailing has been removed and replaced with a futuristic design.",

        "No"
      ],
