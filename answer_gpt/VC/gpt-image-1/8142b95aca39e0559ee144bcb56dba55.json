      "question": "Is the long beard with visible gray streaks present on the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are small figures standing with the main figure, and none of the visible portions on any of them show a long beard with gray streaks. The visible portions of the figures show youthful features indicative of a lack of full facial hair, or in the case of the older depicted figure, any gray streaks. Therefore, based on world knowledge, it suggests they are depicted without long beards and gray streaks.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all figures appear to have a dark blue knot tied atop their heads indicating traditional hairstyles. Based on world knowledge, these knots are signature elements often seen in traditional attire. Thus, there is a knot tied at the top of the head.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the inner robes of the figures do not expose much detail, but flame-like or cloud-shaped motifs are traditionally recognized by curvy or wavy patterns, which appear present when considering stylistically depicted designs on the robes. Thus, based on the available parts of the robes visible, flame-like or cloud-shaped motifs seem to exist.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the figures holding their hands together in a gesture that suggests a respectful or greeting posture commonly seen in traditional artwork, with hands close to the chest area. This aligns with common depictions of clasped or respectful gestures.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays layers of clothing where visible portions at least show outer brown layers and accents involving purple-blue parts. This configuration occurs across all depicted figures, though the cream layer is less explicitly influenced in the smaller figures in the available view due to artistic simplification.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are visible with a clear depiction where their posture is similar to kneeling or in a seated prayer-like gesture. The historical context suggests Image B figures are not standing upright, visible through the artistic rendering where some figures seem to be atop a table-like structure, not standing.",
