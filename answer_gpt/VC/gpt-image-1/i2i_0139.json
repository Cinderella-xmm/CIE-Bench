      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot appears distinctly bright orange, consistent with the general knowledge of carrot colors, especially when fresh and healthy. The color is vivid and visually distinct against the dark tones of the substrate it's planted in, highlighting its brightness.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot maintains a recognizable conical shape, tapering from the broader top to a narrower bottom. This shape is characteristic of the carrot, reflecting the typical growth pattern observed in carrots.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot does not display any visible roots on the tapered top end; it's planted in a substrate resembling small stones or pellets in a futuristic setting. Hence, the tapered top with visible roots is absent as they are not depicted.",
