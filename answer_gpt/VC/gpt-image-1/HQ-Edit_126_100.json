    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the child still seated on the edge of the path near the water container, facing away from the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground shows a pathway leading towards a large tree-like creature rather than a house. There is a figure on the path, but the presence of the water container and the exact position of the child as described in the question cannot be identified due to the alterations in the scene. Therefore, the child is not seated on the edge as originally described.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the curved concrete path extend from the bottom right corner of the image toward the house without deviation or interruption?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the path is consistent with the description of extending from the bottom right corner without visible interruption, however, it leads towards the tree-like creature instead of a house. Despite the change in where it leads, the path itself does not show any deviation or interruption.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a smaller building with a rusted corrugated metal roof visible to the left of the main house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene does not contain any buildings. Instead, the focus is on a large eye-featured tree creature, replacing the house and those elements around it from Image A. Therefore, there is no smaller building visible to the left.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the large green banana leaves and the cluster of bright orange flowers clearly visible in the foreground, just below the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, large green banana leaves and a cluster of bright orange flowers are visible in the foreground, but there is no house present, as the scene has been altered to feature the tree creature. The visibility of the specific vegetation remains intact.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the satellite dish located on the right side of the upper floor, extending outward from the structure on a black metal pole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks any house or structural elements like the satellite dish, which featured in Image A. It instead shows a fantastical creature; thus, no satellite dish is present or extends outward as described.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the lower ends of the stilts firmly planted in the soil along the slope beneath the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no house or stilts, as it showcases a tree creature standing on roots that substitute the structural stilts. Therefore, there are no stilts planted in soil beneath a house structure.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the background composed of rolling green hills covered in dense forest, fading into mist under a partly cloudy blue sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background faithfully recreates the rolling hills and forests, similar to Image A. The mist and cloudy sky are consistent with the original setting, indicating the background composition largely maintains the natural appearance.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there distinct clusters of bright orange flowers growing near the base of the house, adjacent to the banana plant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, clusters of bright orange flowers are visibly growing near the tree creature and the banana plant, similar to the overall positioning in Image A. However, these are near the creature rather than a house. The presence of flowers and their relative location adjacent to the plant remains clear.",
