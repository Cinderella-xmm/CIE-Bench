      "question": "Are the black-framed glasses with rectangular lenses and visible reflections on the lenses still present on the man's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is illustrated, and the details of the glasses are less precise due to the artistic style. The glasses are suggested by the lines, but the depiction of the lenses and reflections is minimal. By contrast, Image A shows definitive glasses with visible reflections. Therefore, considering the image style, the prominent presence of glasses with reflections is not evident in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the trimmed beard and mustache, particularly the defined jawline coverage and upper lip growth, still present on the man's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays an artistic, vintage-styled man without specific facial hair detailing due to the illustrative approach. Image A shows a man with visible facial hair, including beard and mustache. Given the artistic style of Image B, the representation of facial hair is not explicit.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the light brown, textured, swept-back hairstyle with visible volume and side-parting still present on the man's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is depicted in an art style that hinders the precise identification of hair color and texture. The hair appears styled, but specific details about color and texture are not distinguishable. In Image A, the hairstyle is clearly identifiable with volume and texture. Thus, these distinct details are not present in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both hands positioned near the writing object (book), with the right hand showing a grip-like pose and the left hand partially extended toward the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both hands are positioned near the book in a manner that suggests writing, with the illustration capturing a grip-like pose. Image A shows the hands near the typewriter but not a book. The positioning near a book is evident in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the table surface still a flat, white, matte plane with soft reflections and no visible texture or pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an ornate style surrounding the man, and the table surface appears textured and patterned, unlike the plain, white surface in Image A. The ornate presentation offers a different visual context.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the lighting still coming from the front-left, creating a soft highlight on the left side of the face and a subtle shadow on the right side of the neck and shoulder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B adopts a monochromatic and artistic illustration style which doesn't allow for detailed lighting analysis like in Image A. The distinct lighting effects and shadows visible in Image A are abstracted and less apparent in the edited, artistic version.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the man still seated with his torso slightly leaned forward, head tilted upward and to the right, eyes looking up and away?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the torso is positioned to engage with the book, reflecting a forwards lean, but the head tilt and gaze are not detailed to show specific direction as in Image A. The illustrative style simplifies poses and expressions compared to the photographic details.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly depicts a leather-bound book open in front of the man, contrasting with Image A where a typewriter occupies the space. The book's presence is prominent in the edited image.",
