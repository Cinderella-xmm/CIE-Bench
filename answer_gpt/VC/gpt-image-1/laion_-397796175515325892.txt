    "Question": "Q1: Is there a tall, pointed spire rising from the center of the church roof, topped with a cross?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the illustrations clearly depict a tall, pointed spire rising from the center of the church roof. The spire is a distinctive feature of Gothic architecture, and the drawings intricately highlight this pointed roof structure. However, the tips are shown without any crosses, which deviates from a typical church design where a cross often adorns the spire top. Considering the absence of the cross in the edited image, the answer is No.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a centrally located arched doorway beneath a triangular pediment on the main façade?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a triangular pediment prominently on top of the main entrance, which is an arched doorway located centrally. This setup is characteristic of classical architectural styles where the main entrance is grandly framed, making it a focal point. The depiction in the illustration agrees with this architectural norm, hence the answer is Yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the roof surfaces covered with red tiles, particularly on the main gable and side slopes?",
    "explanation": "The illustrated church in Image B features roofs painted in a uniform golden color, which symbolizes traditional illustrations of architectural drawings rather than realistic depictions. The absence of the red tile texture and color visible in Image A suggests the answer is No for the edited image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there multiple arched windows visible on the upper levels of the church façade, arranged symmetrically?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, numerous arched windows are distinctly drawn across the upper levels, presented in a highly symmetrical and organized manner. Symmetry in architectural design is often used to evoke stability and aesthetic harmony. Therefore, the layout in the illustration confirms the presence of these windows, answering Yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the main body of the church constructed from light-colored stone blocks or masonry?",
    "explanation": "The churches in Image B are designed to appear as polished, golden structures typical of illustrative interpretations where details related to material texture are often abstracted for simplicity. The illustration does not emphasize stone or masonry texture but rather highlights consistent flat colors. Thus, the edited image suggests the answer is No.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the church façade consist of a central section flanked by two symmetrical side sections, with a spire rising from the center?",
    "explanation": "Image B demonstrates a church façade that is organized with symmetry across its sectioned design. The façade includes a dominant central portion with symmetrical sections on either side of the central spire, adhering closely to the balanced architectural principles. Thus, this design suggests the answer is Yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is there a cross positioned at the very tip of the spire?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while the spire is central and prominent, it lacks a cross at its tip, a detail often included in church architecture. The edited image follows a geometric illustration style focusing on the architectural shapes without religious symbols, making the answer No.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Is the main entrance located directly under the central gable and aligned with the peak of the roof?",
    "explanation": "Image B clearly positions the main entrance directly beneath the central gable, following the classic architectural alignment where entrances are centrally aligned with the peak, creating a visual axis from the roof’s peak down through the entrance. This observed alignment indicates the answer is Yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
