        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knight is modeled as a chibi character inside a glass dome. The feathered plume is still present on top of the helmet.

      "question": "Is the rampant lion emblem clearly visible on the shield?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shield held by the chibi knight clearly displays a rampant lion emblem. The visual cues indicate a small, detailed crest on the shield, which aligns with common medieval heraldry, emphasizing the importance of identifiable symbols on a knight's shield. The emblem remains clearly visible and is an essential part of the design.",

      "question": "Is the knight holding a long spear or lance in their right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knight is depicted with a short sword rather than a long spear or lance. The visual representation in Image B shows the character inside a dome with a whimsical appearance, where this style often simplifies and minimizes items like weapons. Thus, a short sword is held in the knight's hand, fitting the playful, compact aesthetic of chibi figures.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armor of the chibi knight distinctly features pauldrons (shoulder pieces) and greaves (leg armor) designed with simplified yet clear elements of armor. Although scaled down for the chibi style, these components remain present, highlighting protection typical of medieval knight armor.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome housing the chibi knight includes castle elements with turrets. The turret is shown with a conical roof and flagpole, consistent with typical medieval architecture. This remains a central part of the scene, contributing to the knight's setting.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, strands of ivy are visible in the model encased in the glass dome. These are meant to evoke a medieval castle setting by adding natural elements to the composite structure. This detail connects with the theme of historical and mythical landscapes.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knight's positioning indicates facing forward rather than towards the right side of the image. The shield is held firmly on the knight's left arm as per typical knightly depictions, aligning with the need for defense while the right hand wields a sword. There is no indication of a shift in position within the contained model compared to potential dynamic poses outside.",
