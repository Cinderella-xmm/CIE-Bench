      "question": "Is the cosmic vortex depicted as a multi-layered spiral structure with concentric rings winding inward toward a central point?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cosmic vortex is illustrated using a pattern of spiraling shapes, similar to a stained glass design, with distinct concentric arrangements that create a spiral motion toward a central point. This style typically involves multiple layers or segments coming together, forming a cohesive spiral structure. The stained glass mosaic alludes to the various layers integral to such a depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there multiple trees with rounded, full canopies positioned in the foreground and midground of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, it shows several trees with stylized, round canopies typical of a stained-glass art form. Their positioning in the foreground and midground is evident, contributing to the composition's depth. This artistic convention hints at a balance and structure, consistent with landscapes where such elements are usually incorporated.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cosmic vortex positioned directly above the forest, occupying the upper half of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cosmic vortex occupies a significant portion of the upper half of the image, directly above the stylized representation of a forest. The vortex's position aligns with a design choice that emphasizes the sky, situating cosmic elements above earthly landscapes.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a calm, reflective body of water in the foreground, mirroring the sky and surrounding landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is a representation of water depicted as horizontal stained glass sections in the foreground. These sections are suggestive of reflective water, typical in stained glass art, where the color gradations imply a body of water mirroring the above environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there mountain ranges visible in the background, situated behind the trees and beneath the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays mountain ranges through geometric patterns typical in stained glass. These appear in the background, beyond the foreground elements like the trees. This layer is beneath the sky and cosmic vortex, aligning with typical landscape structures where mountains sit at the horizon.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the trees have foliage with a noticeable pink or rose-colored tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees have foliage depicted in shades of red and pink, consistent with a rose-toned palette. This choice aligns with the stained glass artistic approach, which uses bold color segments to create visual interest and harmony.",
