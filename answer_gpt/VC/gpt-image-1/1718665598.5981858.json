    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a long, continuous road-like structure extending into the distance, serving as the central axis of the composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized triangular patterns conspicuously form a narrow, winding path-like structure that extends into the distance. The yellow line marking within the paving-like triangular shapes indicates a road-like feature, which emphasizes the continuity and distance, thereby serving as the central axis of the composition. This portrayal exploits geometric designs to create an impression of spatial depth and alignment, paralleling the natural perception of a continuous road receding in perspective.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible diagonal streaks or patterns indicating falling rain across the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a stylized interpretation using geometric shapes without depicting any distinct diagonal streaks or patterns that resemble falling rain. The composition focuses on angular fragmented designs that do not communicate precipitation through conventional visual cues like slanted lines or blurs frequently used to symbolize rain.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there tall vertical structures with horizontal crossbars positioned along the right side of the road?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features vertical forms resembling utility poles with prominent horizontal crossbars aligned along the right side of the road-like structure. These are represented through geometric triangular patterns that create the silhouette and crossbar structure typical of telegraph poles, using abstraction while maintaining identifiable traits.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there tree-like forms present on both sides of the road, aligned with the guardrails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the compilation of triangles on either side of the road two-dimensionally implies tree-like structures. These are fashioned in way that their arrangement echoes the conceptual form of trees, providing natural elements to the composition adjacent to the road without explicit guardrails. This illustrates an abstract adaptation of nature beside roadways.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a visible division in the sky between dark clouds and a brighter, illuminated area near the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a discernible delineation between dark and lighter regions in the upper part of the composition, achieving an abstract representation reminiscent of sky division with dark clouds against illuminated areas. This is rendered through contrasting shades used in the geometric array, mirroring the natural occurrence near horizons where light and shadow oppose one another.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there barrier-like structures running along both edges of the road?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the abstraction does not distinctly illustrate any barrier-like elements along the edges of the suggested road. The composition comprises artistic shapes that fulfill the notion of roadsides but lack specific features to indicate barriers or guardrails running parallel to the road, contrary to conventional depictions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a continuous yellow line running down the center of the road?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B distinctly shows a central yellow line formed by triangular patterns following the road-like axis, portraying a continuous streak down the middle. This stylistic choice mirrors the marking customary to paved roads, employing geometric segments that visually guide the eye along the image's depth towards the horizon, characterizing roadway continuity.",
