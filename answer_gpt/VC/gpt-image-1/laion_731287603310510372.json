      "question": "Is the gray flat cap still present on the man's head, maintaining its original shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gray flat cap can be seen on the man's head, maintaining the same position and style as it did in Image A, which appears consistent with typical flat cap design. The visual cues indicate no change in shape or placement.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The side profile in Image B shows the small brown leather tag positioned at the back side of the cap, just as it appears in Image A. This tag is a typical feature found on many flat caps for branding purposes.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is indeed wearing a heather gray crew-neck t-shirt. The lighting and editing effects give the appearance a vintage look, but the t-shirt's style and color remain identifiable and consistent with Image A.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not provide visual information to assess facial features like a mustache or goatee due to facial blurring. Therefore, this aspect cannot be determined.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition of Image B shows the man in a side profile, facing towards the left, which matches how he is positioned in Image A. This position is highlighted by the visibility of the ear and the way the cap is worn.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the stylistic edit, the textures of the cap and shirt exhibit characteristics typical of heather gray fabric, such as the mix of lighter and darker fibers, keeping the original appearance consistent with Image A.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
