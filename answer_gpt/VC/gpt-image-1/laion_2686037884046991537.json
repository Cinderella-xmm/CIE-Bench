      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are depicted as whoopie pies with a consistent dark brown color representing the chocolate outer layer of a typical whoopie pie.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each whoopie pie character is illustrated with a distinctive white band separating the two chocolate halves, indicative of the cream filling commonly found in whoopie pies. The visual representation aligns with typical whoopie pies, which have an obvious contrast with the dark chocolate outer layer and the white filling.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each whoopie pie character is drawn to have a two-layered appearance, wherein two chocolate layers are divided by a visible white center. This aligns with standard whoopie pie constructions where two cookie-like cake layers sandwich a cream filling, confirming the structural representation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text indicates a setting, but visually, the depiction does not clearly show a plate edge with characters prominently on it. The whoopie pies are more effectively portrayed as characters illustrating an idea or story, distinct from detailed positioning on a plate.",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the whoopie pie characters are consistently drawn with a round or oval appearance, typical of the circular shape of actual whoopie pies. This rounded depiction is a traditional shape for the dessert, confirming the characters' shapes.",
