      "question": "Is the dragon-headed prow with detailed carvings and open jaws present at the front of the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the ship does feature a dragon-headed prow with open jaws, as typically seen in Viking-themed imagery. This is indicated by the prominent depiction of the dragon's head, which is a stylized and simplified piece of artwork characteristic of this theme. This matches typical representations of Viking longships in art, combining imaginative design with historical style cues.",

      "question": "Is the dark red and black circular knotwork emblem centered on the beige sail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a beige sail with a central circular emblem featuring intricate knotwork in dark red and black colors. This is a common design element in Nordic and Viking iconography, suggesting authenticity and consistency with cultural depictions of such sails.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are multiple circular shields with distinct symbols mounted along the side of the ship beneath the oars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although Image B shows circular shields with distinct symbols on the side of the ship, in this depiction, they are above the oars, integrated into the overall artistic design of the box cover. Generally, Viking longship art would place shields along the sides, but the positioning can vary depending on the artistic interpretation.",

      "question": "Are there multiple oars extending outward from the hull, each connected to a small human-like figure representing a rower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, oars extend outward from the hull, but there are no visible small human-like figures associated with these oars representing rowers. The ship depicted is more stylized and does not show detailed figures manning the oars as a real-life depiction might.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized depiction of the shipâ€™s hull does not provide sufficient detail to identify clearly defined horizontal wooden planks with visible grain, a feature more typical of naturalistic or model depictions of Viking ships.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a single central mast supporting a square-shaped sail, which is a common design for Viking ships, and the sail appears to be fully unfurled. The depiction lacks detailed ropes, but the artistic representation clearly shows the sail being held aloft by the mast, consistent with the stylized design.",
