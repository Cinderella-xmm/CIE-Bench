      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's hair is illustrated as a short, neat bob haircut that curves inward slightly, appearing straight and black.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress is red and sleeveless, but instead of a knitted texture, it has a smooth surface with decorative embroidery, typical of a drawing's artistic interpretation, where specific textures may not be detailed as in photographic representation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly wings have blue centers. However, instead of brown borders, they are entirely blue with no color variations evident, such as brown or orange. The wings serve as a purely artistic element without the specific color details mentioned.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's hands are held together in front of her chest, creating a visually clasped appearance, but the fingers are not interlocked; they are pressed against each other in a prayer-like gesture. This is a common pose seen in artistic illustrations.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible strap crossing diagonally on the woman or depicted in the illustration. The absence of the strap is consistent with the simplified style and design of artistic renditions where additional accessories might be excluded.",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's hands show an illustration of fingernails that are not distinctly colored in red polish, as is typical of artistic representations where detailed nail polish color might be omitted for design simplicity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
