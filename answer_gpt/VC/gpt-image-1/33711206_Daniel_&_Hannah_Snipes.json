      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is depicted in a simplified, cartoonish style, and it is evident she is wearing a rust-colored cardigan over a white skirt. While the top is not distinctly separate from the skirt in the image, the coloration and layering imply a white top as part of the outfit. The illustration uses simple lines and colors consistent with a long white skirt. Thus, the depiction matches the description provided.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the child in a green dress with a pattern that can be interpreted as floral due to the artistic style and use of implied patterns consistent with flowers.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are various floral elements and colors depicted in the background, but they are not distinguished with specific colors such as orange, purple, or white. The flowers are simplified, and the art style doesnâ€™t emphasize those particular colors, focusing instead on softer pastel impressions.",
