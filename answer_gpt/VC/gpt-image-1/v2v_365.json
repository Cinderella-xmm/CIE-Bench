      "question": "Does the edited image retain the alternating tan and dark brown pattern on the turtle's shell?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the turtle-themed character has a shell with a distinct pattern that resembles growth lines and shading, creating areas of varied coloration. However, it is styled and may not precisely alternate in colors as in Image A. Nevertheless, it retains a suggestion of patterning similar to the original turtle's shell. Thus, the pattern is retained in a stylized manner.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the turtle's limb structure, even if the limbs are stylized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the turtle-themed character has stylized limbs that resemble the original turtle's four legs, albeit with cartoon-like proportions. This indicates retention of the limb structure in a more playful and exaggerated style.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the textured appearance of the turtle's shell?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's shell has a smooth, cartoonish finish rather than the detailed, textured appearance of a real turtle's shell seen in Image A. The texture is not represented in the stylized version.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The turtle-themed character in Image B features a head with clear and prominent eyes, and the overall head shape is suggestive of a turtle. The eyes are exaggerated in size, typical of chibi style, while still retaining the recognizable characteristics of a turtle's head.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The turtle-themed character in Image B has limbs that appear smooth and stylized, lacking the textured and detailed scales seen on the real turtle's limbs in Image A. This shows that while the limb structure is retained, the texture is not.",
