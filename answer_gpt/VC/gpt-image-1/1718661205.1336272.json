    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the woman’s facial profile, including the shape of her nose, jaw, and eyes, preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is represented as a LEGO figurine, which inherently simplifies and abstracts human features, including the face. This results in the loss of detailed facial structures such as the nose, jawline, and eye shape. Therefore, the facial profile is not preserved in the edited version.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the woman’s hair light brown in color and styled in a braid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the woman as a LEGO figure, which typically simplifies hair into solid blocks. The hair is depicted as light brown and styled in a ponytail rather than a braid, differing from intricate styles seen in Image A. Thus, the hair is light brown but not braided.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the shirt and vest rendered in the original beige and olive-green colors, respectively?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the woman's LEGO figure wearing a vest and shirt. The vest in Image B is bright yellow, and the shirt is depicted with an olive-green tone. Comparing this to the original colors in Image A, where the shirt is beige and the vest is olive-green, reveals a mismatch. Therefore, the colors are not preserved.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the woman’s hands positioned on a control mechanism in the same way as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO version of the woman has her hands positioned on a control mechanism, similar to Image A, maintaining the basic hand placement on the steering controls. Hence, the hand positioning is consistent between images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the straps and buckles of the tactical vest visibly present and structurally intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO reconstruction of the vest does not include visible straps and buckles as seen in conventional tactical vests. LEGO figures simplify such elements, omitting detailed structural features present in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the woman’s skin tone and facial expression (calm, focused) preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a LEGO design, which simplifies and alters human features like skin tone and expression. LEGO figures typically lack detailed facial expressions or nuanced skin tones. Thus, these aspects are not preserved.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the woman have blue-gray eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the woman as a classic LEGO figure, which does not display detailed eye colors such as blue-gray. LEGO figures typically have uniform black eyes, so the original eye color is not maintained.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
