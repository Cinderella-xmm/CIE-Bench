    "Question": "Q3: Are the face, belly, and limbs of the hippo rendered in light gray color?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the face of the hippo is rendered in a light gray color, which is part of its design. Similarly, the depiction of its nose and inner areas around the muzzle also suggests a light gray tone. However, the belly and limbs of the hippo are covered in the tiger stripe pattern, with no light gray visible, contradicting the question's claim.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the beach ball have red, yellow, and white horizontal stripes?",
