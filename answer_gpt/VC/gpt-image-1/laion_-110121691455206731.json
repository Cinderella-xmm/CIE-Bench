      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the text \"MICHAEL KORS\" present in uppercase letters below the 12 o'clock position on the dial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch face has been edited to depict a cartoon character with a blank face aside from expressive elements like eyes and a smile. The typical elements of a watch such as brand names and numerical markings, including 'MICHAEL KORS,' are not present. Therefore, based on Image B, 'MICHAEL KORS' is not visible anywhere on the dial as it has been transformed into a cartoon face without text elements.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there three subdials located at the 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions, with the 3 o'clock subdial marked 24-hour scale, the 6 o'clock subdial marked seconds, and the 9 o'clock subdial marked minutes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, it showcases a cartoon character watch face without any subdial indications. The design is simplified to emphasize the cartoon character features for creative storytelling. Therefore, the presence and markings of subdials described in the question are absent in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a rectangular date window at the 4 o'clock position showing the number \"18\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon representation does not include any functional watch elements like a date window. The dial area is stylized for the cartoon character, omitting features such as a date display that may be present in a real watch for practicality. Consequently, in Image B, there is no date window visible.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the watch have a black leather strap with an embossed crocodile texture and visible stitching along the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the design elements of the watch strap from Image A. The strap in Image B is visually similar to the described black leather with crocodile texturing and visible stitches on the edges, despite the cartoonization emphasizing character features primarily on the dial. This logical deduction confirms the strap details remain consistent.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the watch case and dial finished in a silver metallic tone with a brushed texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, the cartoon character replaces the watch's typical dial, but the case still visually maintains a silver metallic appearance, albeit simplified for cartoon representation. While detailing like a brushed texture is not emphasized due to stylization, the basic tone of 'silver metallic' remains evident.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a continuous minute track around the outer edge of the dial with markings from 5 to 60?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reimagines the watch dial significantly by converting it into a cartoon character without minute track indications or any numerical markings traditionally found in watches. Hence, the continuous minute track that would typically be present is eradicated in favor of an animated design without numeric references.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the numbers 12, 2, 4, 8, and 10 displayed as Arabic numerals at their respective positions on the dial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, showcasing a cartoon watch character, eliminates traditional numeric presentations, including Arabic numerals, in favor of character-focused design. The absence of numbers altogether linguistically transforms its core function from time indication to storytelling without retaining numeric indicators.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there two pushers and a crown located on the right side of the watch case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B visually maintains two pushers and a crown on the watch case's right side even while prioritizing cartoon styling for the dial itself. These mechanical aspects of the watch case remain, highlighting practical features of watch anatomy integrated with character depiction.",
