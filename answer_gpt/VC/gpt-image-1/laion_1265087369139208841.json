      "question": "Are the two cylindrical corner towers still present at the left and right ends of the castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which is depicted within a snow globe, the left and right sides of the castle feature cylindrical structures that resemble towers. This indicates that these architectural elements are still present in the edited image. Comparing this with Image A, which has clear cylindrical towers at both ends, confirms that the elements persist in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the two central square turrets with pointed finials remain atop the central section of the castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, these key architectural elements manifest as square turrets with pointed finials positioned at the top center of the castle. Recognizing these visual traits indicates the presence of the turrets in the edited image. When compared to the original Image A, where such features are defined, it confirms these remain.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the large central arched entranceway still present and centrally aligned with the pathway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The large central arched entranceway in Image B is clearly observable and remains centrally aligned with the pathway leading to it. This observation is congruent with the original Image A, where the entrance is central and aligns with the path, demonstrating that this key feature is retained in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the arched windows and openings arranged symmetrically across the front facade of the castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arched windows and openings are symmetrically distributed across the castle's facade within the snow globe, exhibiting a balance in design. In comparison with Image A, where symmetry in the arrangement of windows and openings is evident, it shows that this symmetry is maintained in the edited version.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the castle still constructed from dark gray and reddish-brown stone blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a castle with a fantastical design emphasizing an ivy-covered facade and not the distinct dark gray and reddish-brown stone blocks. Comparing this with Image A, where the stone's coloration is distinct, indicates a divergence in material appearance in Image B, and thus, it's not retained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the upper portion of the castle still open to the sky, revealing the lack of a roof and internal framework?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B represents the castle in a mystical snow globe with a comprehensive roof and walls intact, unlike a ruin. This contrasts with Image A, which depicts an open-sky view due to the ruinous state, indicating that the edited image portrays a fully constructed castle, not open to the sky.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the castle entrance symmetrically centered with the pathway leading to it similar to Image A, which displays a clear alignment of the central entranceway with the pathway. This alignment persists in the edited image.",
