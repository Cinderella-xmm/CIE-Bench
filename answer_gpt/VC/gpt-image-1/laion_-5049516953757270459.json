      "question": "Is the overall shape of the food arrangement a perfect heart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the overall shape resembles a heart, but it isn't a perfect heart. Considering world knowledge, a 'heart' shape typically has a rounded top and a pointed bottom, and Image B fits a stylized heart shape, suggesting imperfection due to the LEGO block construction. Therefore, considering irregularities, the shape is not perfect.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's a structure resembling an avocado that has a yellowish section indicative of the pit cavity, maintaining its recognizable form. World knowledge on avocado halves, which often display a pit cavity, helps to affirm this object's identity.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays multiple green pieces resembling asparagus stalks bundled together, with a yellow band mimicking a tying structure. Using knowledge of asparagus bundles, their representation suggests bundling, highlighting adherence to bundling tradition.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, red, blue, and smaller red pieces at the top-left suggest grouping similar to berries found in mixed berry collections. Based on typical berry clustering and color identification, they are grouped together in the expected pattern.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Using world knowledge, a purple circular structure in Image B implies an onion, logically positioned next to what pass for broccoli and garlic figures. This spatial arrangement mirrors typical culinary associations.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, white circular structures near the center suggest mushrooms, consistent with the appearance of mushrooms, which tend to cluster in groups in culinary displays, helping identify them as such.",
