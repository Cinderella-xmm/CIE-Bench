      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the person's raised hand with an open palm is clearly visible. The hand is drawn above the person's head, similar to a greeting or a wave. This is consistent with world knowledge where greeting gestures often involve an open palm facing outward. Therefore, based on the visible cues, the raised hand is present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background has been altered to focus solely on the person taking a photo, without any bathroom elements. There are no details or objects resembling a bathroom mirror or wall, as the setting is completely replaced with a simplified drawing. In Image A, a wooden-framed mirror is clearly visible. Therefore, the wooden-framed mirror is not present in the edited version.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person is drawn holding an object that strongly resembles a phone or a camera with the hand positioned near their face, maintaining the action of taking a photo. This suggests a direct depiction of the object in a similar function as in Image A where a similar object is held. Therefore, based on visual cues, the edited image retains the representation of the object near the face.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person is illustrated wearing a T-shirt featuring a graphic of a bird and a necklace with a pendant similar, if not identical, to the depiction in Image A. Although colors are not specified in the simplified drawing, the presence of the graphic design and necklace in both images confirms continuity in attire. Therefore, from the illustration presented, the person is still wearing a T-shirt with a graphic and a necklace.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drawing focuses on the person and omits the bathroom setting, making no reference to background objects such as a sink or faucet. These elements are present in Image A, where a white sink with a faucet is visible in the background. Given the absence of such details in Image B, there is no sink with a faucet visible.",
