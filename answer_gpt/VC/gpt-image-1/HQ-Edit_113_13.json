    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the fox retain its characteristic orange fur on the back and sides, white fur on the chest and muzzle, and black fur on the lower legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fox is depicted in a cartoonish manner, simplified with bright orange fur and lacks the realistic detail typical of a real fox. It does retain the contrasting colors with an orange body, a white chest and muzzle, and dark-colored fur on the limbs, which is a simplified representation consistent with common depictions of foxes. The stylization in illustration maintains key color patterns distinguishing foxes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the fox’s tail bushy and curled, ending in a clearly visible white tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the style of Image B, the fox has a bushy tail, which is curled and concludes with a white tip. Cartoon representations often exaggerate features for expressiveness, and this simplified drawing follows suit to maintain visual character similarity that's commonly identified with foxes.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there two monarch butterflies with orange and black wings hovering near the fox’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, near the fox's head, there's a singular butterfly depicted with orange and black resembling a monarch butterfly. However, there isn't a second butterfly present, showcasing the simplified design maintaining the scene essence without replicating all elements from realism.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B doesn't depict any white daisies growing in the foreground. It captures a scene aligned in simplicity where the ground is clear without detailed flora, unlike realistic renderings with intricate foregrounds showcasing detailed flower illustrations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the ground is presented with grass elements and surrounding foliage, the depiction omits the heavy detailing typical of green moss with visible texture and de-emphasizes intricate natural details for a minimalist appearance characteristic of illustrations.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a glowing light source nor rays shining through the canopy as found in realistic settings. This cartoonish illustration opts for solid, pastel backgrounds without the characteristic depth and light dynamics seen in natural forest environments.",
