      "question": "Is the NASA logo clearly visible on the left shoulder of the space suit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the NASA logo is indeed visible on the left shoulder of the space suit as part of the informative graphic elements. The logo is prominently displayed, as is common for NASA-related spacesuits, and is not obscured by any other design elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red trim bands visible on the upper arm and lower leg of the space suit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the red trim bands are clearly visible on both the upper arm and lower leg of the astronaut's space suit. These bands are often utilized for design or identification purposes and are distinct enough to be observed easily.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the white backpack unit attached to the back of the suit, with coiled white hoses extending down the sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white backpack unit is attached to the back of the space suit. Coiled white hoses are visibly extending down the sides, which is significant as these hoses likely represent life-support or communication systems within the suit.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any indication that the helmet's visor is partially raised. The visor appears to be entirely closed, maintaining the typical appearance of a sealed space helmet which is crucial for protection and environmental support.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the astronaut is indeed standing upright and facing towards the observer's right-hand side of the image. The suit is presented in a profile view which aligns with the description provided.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hoses are visibly connected from the backpack to the suit, particularly around the torso area. This connection is a typical characteristic of space suits involving life-support systems.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the astronaut's boots and gloves are visible and seem to be properly attached to the suit. This appearance is consistent with astronaut gear where ensuring secure attachment is necessary for functionality and safety.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a blue tarp covering the floor; instead, the background appears to be more related to control room settings. The astronaut is shown in an informational graphic, not a physical environment with floor coverings like tarp.",
