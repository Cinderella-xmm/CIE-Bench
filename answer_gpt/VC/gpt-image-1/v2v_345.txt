    "Question": "Q1: Is the USB-C port located centrally on the bottom edge of the smartphone, flanked by two sets of three circular speaker holes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the smartphone features a USB-C port centrally positioned on its bottom edge. This visual detail is reinforced by observing the symmetrical arrangement of speaker holes, two sets of three circular holes on either side of the port. Combining this observation with common knowledge of smartphone designs confirms the USB-C port's central placement. Image A depicts a similar orientation of the port, affirming that the design remains unchanged between images.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the smartphone placed diagonally on the wooden surface, with its bottom edge closer to the viewer than the top edge?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the smartphone appears oriented such that its bottom edge is noticeably closer to the foreground compared to the top edge, indicating a diagonal placement on the surface. This perspective gives the impression of depth, which is typical when objects are positioned diagonally relative to the viewer. Image A similarly presents the smartphone with the same diagonal orientation, confirming consistency in placement.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the wooden surface display a consistent horizontal grain pattern with warm brown tones and visible wood fibers?",
    "explanation": "The wooden surface in Image B visibly features horizontal grain patterns and fibers, showcasing warm brown tones that are associated with wood surfaces. This observation is based on visual cues that identify typical characteristics of wood, such as the patterns and texture. Image A also displays a similar wooden surface with consistent grain patterns and tones, supporting the observation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the background a uniform beige color with a soft blur effect, providing a shallow depth of field?",
    "explanation": "Image B exhibits a background consisting of a uniform beige color with a soft blur, indicative of a shallow depth of field. This visual technique is often used in photography to focus attention on the foreground by blurring the background. From a comparison perspective, Image A portrays the same background effect, confirming uniformity in both images.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the mouse positioned to the left of the smartphone, with both objects resting on the same wooden surface?",
    "explanation": "The mouse in Image B is positioned to the left of the smartphone, with both elements clearly resting on the same wooden surface. This spatial arrangement is evident from their relative positions on the surface. Image A also maintains this configuration, demonstrating consistency in positioning across both images.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Is the mouse oriented such that its head is turned toward the smartphone?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mouse shows an orientation where its head is directed toward the smartphone. The positioning implies interaction or interest in the smartphone, a common visual representation when depicting subjects in proximity to each other. Image A similarly displays the mouse with its head turned toward the smartphone, ensuring uniform orientation in both images.",
    "answer": "Yes"
