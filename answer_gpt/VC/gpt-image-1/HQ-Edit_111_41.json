      "question": "Is the chair supported by a five-star base with exactly five legs, each ending in a caster?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chair is designed to resemble a LEGO or building block replica of a real office chair. The base of the chair is structured to mirror a five-star design, which is common in office chairs for stability, where each 'leg' or branch extends out to support a caster. Despite the construction having a block-like appearance, it clearly shows five distinct arms or extensions, each terminating in a small wheel that acts as a caster. This design attempts to replicate the functional aspect of a real office chair despite the toy-like nature of the model.",

      "question": "Is there a separate headrest cushion positioned directly above the main backrest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a chair that features a visibly distinct and block-like segment attached above the backrest, which serves as a headrest. This separate piece mimics the purpose of a headrest found in real-life office chairs, meant to support the head or neck. The design uses block aesthetics, but its placement and separation from the main backrest are clear indicators of it being a distinct headrest component.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there two armrests, one on each side, extending horizontally from the chairâ€™s midsection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chair displays armrests that are attached to each side, extending horizontally similar to traditional office chair designs. These armrests are black with gray supports and are positioned midsection of the chair. The design resembles typical ergonomic arrangements where the armrests are made to aid comfort by providing support to the user's arms while seated.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the backrest vertically aligned behind the seat, rising from the same central axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backrest is constructed to rise directly from the back end of the seat portion. Its alignment with the seat suggests a cohesive central structure that is typical in office chair designs, where both parts are integral for the support of the sitter's posture. This vertical alignment is consistent across designs aiming to maximize ergonomic support, reaffirmed by the unified visual flow of seat and backrest in this block-inspired representation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the chair maintain a tall, high-back silhouette with the headrest significantly higher than the seat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chair in Image B displays a high backrest with an attached separate headrest. This configuration results in a silhouette that rises well above the seat level, indicating a high-back design. By providing visual height through distinct blocks for the back and headrest, it captures the impression of chairs meant for extended back and neck support, typical in executive or ergonomic office chair models.",
