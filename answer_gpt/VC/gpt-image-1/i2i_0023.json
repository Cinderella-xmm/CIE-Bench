      "question": "Does the boy's face retain clear and recognizable features such as eyes, nose, and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area where the boy's face should be is intentionally blurred, with no visible features like eyes, nose, or mouth. This indicates that the face is not clear or recognizable. Comparing to Image A, where the face is visible but also blurred, the face remains unrecognizable in both images due to the blur effect. Therefore, the lack of distinguishable facial features remains consistent.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are all four original birds present, with the macaw on the shoulder, the cockatoo on the arm, the canary on the head, and the parakeet near the side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a cartoon representation of the scene, with the four birds illustrated in similar positions as in Image A. The macaw is on the boy's left shoulder, the cockatoo is on the right arm, the canary seated at the top center of the head, and the parakeet near the bottom. These positions are consistent with those of Image A, ensuring that all birds are present and retaining familiarity through cartoon drawings.",

      "question": "Is the cartoon print on the boy's green T-shirt still visible and intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green T-shirt features the cartoon print very clearly, matching the print seen in Image A. The Angry Birds-themed design is still visible and integral to the design of the shirt both in real photo and cartoon format.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the boyâ€™s head visibly larger compared to the shrunken size of the birds in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon depiction shows the boy's head in proportion relative to the size of the birds, which seem to be slightly oversized compared to the usual size of such birds and the likely size of a child's head. This contrasts with Image A's real-life sizing where the head-size to bird-size looks more natural; thus, the head is not visibly larger than birds.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image feature a thick white outline around the boy and the birds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B distinctly features a thick white outline, often used in illustrations to provide emphasis and separation from the background. This kind of outline is absent in Image A, where the photograph naturally blends into its enclosure without such boundaries.",
