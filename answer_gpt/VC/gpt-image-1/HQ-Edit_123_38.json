    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the balance beam made of wood with visible wear and chipped paint?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any realistic element like a balance beam made of wood; it is characterized by an artistic starry background, not a gym setting. Thus, the idea of a wooden beam doesn't apply.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the gymnast maintain a handstand with her body arched backward and legs lifted vertically above her head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features stylized illustrations of gymnasts depicted in various contorted positions that resemble gymnastic postures. However, it doesn't realistically portray a handstand with legs lifted vertically, as it's more abstract.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the leotard divided into silver upper body and blue lower body with a gradient transition and sparkles along the spine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gymnasts are portrayed in monochromatic blues without realistic detail like a leotard with gradient or specific sparkles along the spine. Hence, this particular leotard description is irrelevant.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the gymnast’s hair styled in a tight bun secured with a blue hair tie?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustrations in Image B simplify the human form and do not include specific details like hair styling or accessories such as hair ties. Therefore, the hair is abstractly drawn rather than styled.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible chalk marks on the balance beam beneath the gymnast’s hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show a balance beam with realistic elements like chalk marks. The illustrations focus on abstract and artistic representations without these detailed textures.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a small stud earring visible on the gymnast’s left ear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not detail such things as earrings; gymnasts in the image are stylized and lack these realistic touches.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the gymnast’s face turned sideways with her eyes looking downward toward the beam?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, facial features and direction are abstract, without details such as eye direction or beam gaze, as the depiction is artistic rather than realistic.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are the gymnast’s hands placed flat on top of the beam, supporting her body in a handstand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the abstract nature of Image B, gymnasts' hands are not depicted in a handstand posture on any beam; outlines are suggestive rather than anatomically correct for support.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Are white gymnastic grips visible on the gymnast’s hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show gymnastic grips or any detailed depiction of the hands. The focus is on stylized representation rather than specific garments or gear.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q10",
      "question": "Is there a blurred audience in tiered seating behind the gymnast, illuminated by overhead stadium lights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain stadium elements; it features abstract artwork with a star-filled background. There is no audience or stadium seating depicted.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
