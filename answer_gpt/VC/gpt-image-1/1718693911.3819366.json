      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the cat's fur predominantly white?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, by observing the simplified and abstract style with prominent colors, the illustration gives a sense of a cartoon version where specific details like fur color may not be directly visible. World knowledge about this type of illustration can imply representation rather than exact replication of colors. The use of a different color palette means I can't confirm the fur's actual color.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the cat sitting upright on the sand with front paws forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette and general shape show a similar posture to the typical 'cat sitting' position. The abstract nature still allows for visual cues representing front paws placed forward.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a hot dog in a bun with a zigzag of mustard on top, placed in front of the cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a hot dog explicitly with a visible bun and a zigzag pattern on top which represents mustard. This stylized illustration simplifies object shapes but retains recognizable features.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a harness around the cat's neck and chest with a visible buckle and a pouch-like attachment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses on extreme simplification and abstraction, emphasizing color and shape over intricate details like a harness. It does not clearly show any such accessory.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sunglasses positioned over the cat's eyes, covering the upper part of the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited illustration (Image B), the sunglasses shape is centered on the typical eye area of what represents a cat, suggesting coverage of the upper face area despite the abstract style.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible white whiskers extending from the cat's muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes bold, flat colors with minimal detail, which does not include intricate features like whiskers.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the cat's tail curled slightly to the right side of its body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given the stylized approach in Image B, the curvature of details like a tail might not follow the same curvature or orientation as realistic depictions. This image does not clearly display a distinct tail shape as observed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hot dog depiction includes a clear zigzag pattern that is consistent with typical mustard application, even in its simplified format.",
