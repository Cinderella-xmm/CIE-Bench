        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's face is blurred, making it impossible to determine eye color based on the visual information provided.",

      "question": "Does the subject have dark wavy hair with two feather-like adornments on each side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we can observe that the subject has dark wavy hair with two feather-like adornments positioned symmetrically on each side of the hair.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a detailed steampunk clock fixed in the chest area, not a glowing golden orb that emits light like in Image A. Thus, based on this observation, there is no glowing orb on the chest in the edited image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The orientation of the subject in Image B suggests a direct forward-facing posture. While the facial features canâ€™t be discerned due to blurring, the stance and orientation of the shoulders support a forward-facing position, implying a neutral or formal presentation.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings in Image B are quite symmetrical, extending from behind the subject's shoulders. They are designed to maintain a balanced appearance, consistent with visual symmetry commonly seen in depictions of characters with wings.",
