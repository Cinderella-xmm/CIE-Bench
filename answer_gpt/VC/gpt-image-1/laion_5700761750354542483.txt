    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the butterfly’s four-winged structure with two large upper wings and two smaller lower wings?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the butterfly clearly exhibits a four-winged structure. There are two upper wings that are larger in size and two smaller wings below them. This is a typical structure for butterflies, where the upper wings are larger to aid in flight, and the lower wings are smaller and aid in maneuverability.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the butterfly depicted with symmetrical wings on both sides?",
    "explanation": "The edited image shows the butterfly with symmetrical wings on both sides. This symmetry is evident in both the shape and the pattern of the colors and designs on the wings. Symmetrical wings are common in butterflies for aesthetic and functional purposes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a visible central body connecting the wings?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the butterfly's central body is situated vertically and connects both sets of wings. The body appears to be robust and prominent, indicating it serves as the main structure connecting the wings to form a cohesive insect body.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a loop or attachment point at the top of the butterfly’s head?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing the edited image, there is no visible loop or attachment point at the top of the butterfly's head. The design is more focused on the decorative aspect of the butterfly's body and wings without additional attachment features.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the butterfly positioned with wings fully spread in a flat, horizontal orientation?",
    "explanation": "The butterfly in the edited image is shown with wings fully spread out in a flat orientation. This spread-wing position is typical for presentation and display purposes, showing the entirety of the wing's design and detail.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the wings proportionally larger than the body, matching the original scale?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the wings are visibly proportionally larger than the body, which matches the general characteristic scale observed in butterflies. This proportional difference aids in flight mechanics and is aesthetically pleasing.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do the upper wings have a pointed tip and curved outer edge?",
    "explanation": "The upper wings of the butterfly in the edited image exhibit a pointed tip and a curved outer edge. This gives the wings their distinctive shape, which is common in butterfly wing designs for both functional and decorative reasons.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Are the lower wings visibly smaller and more rounded than the upper wings?",
    "explanation": "The edited image shows that the lower wings of the butterfly are indeed smaller and have a more rounded shape compared to the upper wings. This size and shape difference is typical in butterfly anatomy for aerodynamic advantages.",
    "answer": "Yes"
