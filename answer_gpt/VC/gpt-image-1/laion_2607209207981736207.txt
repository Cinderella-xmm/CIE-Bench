    "Question": "Q1: Is the 'Fujitsu fi-7160' model name and logo visibly present on the top-left portion of the scanner in the holographic display?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the holographic display shows a scanner, but there is no visible 'Fujitsu fi-7160' model name or logo. The focus of the design is on its futuristic appearance and digital interface, leaving out specific branding details. World knowledge about how futuristic portrayals often emphasize technology interfaces instead of brand labels helps with this analysis.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the automatic document feeder (ADF) tray open and holding multiple documents, including a boarding pass, receipt, and payment slip, in the holographic display?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ADF tray is shown open with a single piece of paper rather than multiple documents, and no specific identification such as 'boarding pass,' 'receipt,' or 'payment slip' is visible. The portrayal is more futuristic and streamlined without detailed document types.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are the five control buttons (Menu, Stop/Clear, Scan/Enter, Power, and directional navigation) arranged in the same configuration on the right side of the scanner in the holographic display?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the holographic display of the scanner shows buttons but does not maintain the same detailed configuration as in Image A. Futuristic designs might not emphasize identical configuration detail due to stylistic choices.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Is the power button illuminated in green on the right-side control panel of the scanner in the holographic display?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while there is an illuminated button on the right side, it appears in a bright blue or futuristic hue, consistent with the color schema usually found in high-tech designs, not the green illumination seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the row of bristle rollers visible beneath the scanning bed of the scanner in the holographic display?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the holographic display features a closed scanning bed with a digital interface, and there are no visible bristle rollers beneath it. The emphasis is on digital graphics rather than mechanical details.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q6: Are the boarding pass, receipt, and payment slip clearly visible in the ADF tray with readable text such as 'Boarding Pass', 'Receipt', and 'Payment Slip' in the holographic display?",
    "explanation": "In the holographic display of Image B, detailed text like 'Boarding Pass', 'Receipt', and 'Payment Slip' isn't clearly visible. The digital portrayal simplifies or abstracts these details, contrasting with the clear text in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}
