    "Question": "Q2: Are the kitten's eyes still green with a clear, open expression?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes of the kitten are obscured by the blurred section, making it impossible to discern their color or expression. However, based on the visible parts of the kitten, its ears and fur are consistent with the rest of its appearance, suggesting the eyes likely retain their characteristics prior to editing, yet the current state is not visible to confirm.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the background still softly blurred, maintaining focus on the kitten?",
