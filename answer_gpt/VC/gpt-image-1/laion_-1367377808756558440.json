      "question": "Is the hull number \"J244\" clearly visible and positioned on the side of the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a vessel encased in a vintage glass bottle, with an evident number 'J344' on the side, suggesting the number on Image B's ship aligns closely with J244 but has been slightly altered. The distinctive ship-like structure and numbering alignment indicate that the purpose is to emulate the original ship's appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the British flag flying from the secondary mast of the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a colorful flag is flying from one of the masts, but it is adorned with vibrant colors and intricate designs rather than a simple British flag. This flag does not match the traditional design of a British flag and appears more artistic or symbolic, suggesting a departure from expected national flags.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the ship retain its original silhouette with a tall mast, funnel, and forward gun mount?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship depicted within the glass bottle showcases a complex silhouette with large ornate masts and a funnel characteristic that generally retains the appearance of a stylized steamship. It holds to historical ship design elements such as large masts and technical equipment arrangement.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the yellow boat with the text \"HULL HAMLET TOWN\" visible in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is set inside a vintage, stylized bottle, where the specific mention of a 'yellow boat' with text cannot be discerned. The composition focuses almost exclusively on the antique ship and related Victorian-style elements devoid of modern referential details.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the green lampposts with curved arms present along the pier?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, lamps are visible within the encased scene, constructed in a steampunk style. They appear more elaborate and integrated into the ornate nature of the bottle art. They are not traditional green lampposts but capture a similar impression reimagined within this artistic context.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the Australian flag visible on the pole to the left of the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a stylized flag on the ship but is not representative of an Australian flag. The flag visible is more likely creatively adapted or fictitious as part of the glass bottle art and does not convey specific national symbols.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the large white port cranes visible in the background behind the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene focuses on the enclosed ship within a bottle and does not extend to the typical expansive waterfront view that would include port cranes. The meticulous, encapsulated presentation omits such background elements.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are three individuals visible walking along the pier near the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's setting shows an artistic rendering of several figures, appearing as miniature figurines dressed in Victorian style, placed within this creative art piece and are distinct from realistic portrayals of people walking.",
