    "Question": "Q1: Is the V-shaped dual-wing silhouette of the building preserved in the edited version?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette has shifted from a V-shaped building construction to a robotic figure. The dual-wing appearance is specific to architectural structures and does not apply to the edited image of the robot.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the floors stacked in a consistent, repeating modular pattern from bottom to top?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no architectural floors as seen in a building. The revised image depicts a robotic structure composed of gear-like components that don't correlate with floor stacking in building architecture.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the windows and balconies aligned horizontally on each floor?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the notion of windows and balconies has been transformed into glowing panels on the robot. Alignment of floors is irrelevant since no floors exist in the robotic design.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the two wings of the building symmetrically positioned relative to the central vertical axis?",
    "explanation": "Image B represents a robot, which consists of machinery parts and glowing squares but lacks any wings or architectural symmetry similar to a building structure.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the yellow awnings present on the balconies in their original positions?",
    "explanation": "Image B consists of a robotic figure without balconies or awnings. The glowing panels on the robot may give a similar visual cue to yellow, but they do not represent awnings.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a visible separation between the window openings and the projecting balcony overhangs on each floor?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the transformation to a robot does not include window openings or balcony overhangs, as these are elements of architectural design not applicable to the robotic motif.",
    "answer": "No"
}
