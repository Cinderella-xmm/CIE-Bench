      "question": "Is the mechanical eyepatch with visible screws and metallic surface present on the central characterâ€™s right eye?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central character does not have any eyepatch or mechanical device visible across their eye. The facial area near the eye is neither covered with an eyepatch nor does it display any metallic surface or screws. Based on this observation, it can be concluded that an eyepatch is absent.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the central character holding an open book in both hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central character is depicted holding an open book. The book's position suggests that it is being held in both hands, as both hands are near or grasping the book. This is consistent with the typical manner of holding a book for reading, hence the conclusion.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there visible Chinese-style calligraphy on the cover of the book held by the central character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The book cover in Image B does not show any visible Chinese-style calligraphy or markings that resemble such. The cover appears to be plain without any detailed calligraphy, therefore, it can be concluded that there is no Chinese-style calligraphy present.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the central character have short, straight black hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central character is depicted with short, straight hair. Given the grayscale nature of the image and typical noir styling, the color appears black or very dark. This fits the criteria for short, straight black hair even though specific color perception is not possible, based on context and style.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there four distinct supporting characters visible in the background, including one with white hair, one with purple hair, one with blue hair, and one with dark hair and red eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are three distinct supporting characters shown in the background. All are depicted in a grayscale palette typical for noir or mystery themes, making any specific hair color indeterminate. Their appearance suggests individuality, but colored hair is not visible in this stylized depiction.",
      "weight": 2,

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the central character have a calm, neutral facial expression with a slightly downward gaze?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the obscured facial region, the posture and context imply a calm demeanor. The character is holding a book, which often suggests focus and a neutral expression. However, the facial features like eyes or expression are not directly discernible, making it challenging to confirm any gaze direction.",
