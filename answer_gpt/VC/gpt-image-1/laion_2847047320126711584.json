      "question": "Is the donut-shaped object retaining a circular form with a central hole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the donut-shaped objects have been anthropomorphized into cartoon characters, resembling donuts with limbs and facial features. While these characters maintain a circular form, they lack the central hole typical of a traditional donut. Thus, these objects do not retain the standard central hole characteristic of actual donuts.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the donut retain its golden-brown baked color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the transformation into cartoon characters, the main 'body' of the objects resembles a golden-brown color consistent with the typical appearance of baked donuts. This suggests that the donut-like characters retain a color similar to that of a baked donut.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the surface of the donut covered in visible coarse granulated sugar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts donut-style cartoon characters without the detailed textural features of coarse granulated sugar on their surfaces. The illustration style simplifies the surface details, omitting the explicit depiction of sugar granules.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible individual sugar granules on the donut’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration style chooses to not focus on small details like individual sugar granules, instead opting for a smooth, simplified texture which does not show any sugar granules like the original baked donuts would.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the donut’s body formed as a continuous ring with a central opening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The donut-like characters in Image B maintain a circular form, but they are drawn as cartoon characters with features that fill the center space, thus they do not form a continuous ring with the traditional open center.",
