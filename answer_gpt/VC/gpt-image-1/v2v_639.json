      "question": "Does the giraffe retain its distinctive brown patches outlined in cream?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffe is represented as a Lego figure. The blocks used for the giraffe maintain a pattern resembling brown patches on a lighter background, mimicking a real giraffe's natural pattern. Despite the stylized form, the representation of color and pattern is visually consistent with a giraffe's distinctive coat. This abstraction still conveys the essential characteristics of the giraffe's markings.",

      "question": "Is the person depicted with extended hands toward the giraffe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person is also represented as a Lego figure with one hand positioned as if reaching toward the giraffe. This mirrors the action of extending a hand seen in the original image, retaining the gesture of interaction between the figure and the giraffe within the confines of the toy's limited articulation abilities.",

      "question": "Are the person and giraffe positioned close together, maintaining their original relative distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Lego person and the giraffe are placed adjacent to each other on a display platform, simulating the interaction depicted in Image A. The relative size and distance between the two are mimicked within the stylized interpretation of the Lego display, maintaining the sense of proximity and interaction as shown in the original setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffe, depicted as a Lego figure, showcases an elongated neck characteristic of real giraffes. Although simplified, the Lego structure includes several blocks stacked to emulate the length and form of a giraffe's neck, preserving this prominent feature.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Lego person's clothing is designed in a single shade of blue. This choice visually matches the light blue uniform depicted in Image A, capturing the color theme of the attire within the bounds of the Lego aesthetic.",
