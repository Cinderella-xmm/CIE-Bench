    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the original grayish stone texture of the pyramid’s surface retained, including visible weathering and erosion patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image does not depict a traditional pyramid structure with a stone texture that shows weathering and erosion. Instead, it displays a fantasy-like creature with a mosaic pattern made of greenish, vine-like intertwined designs, which suggests a departure from the realistic stone texture observed in historical pyramids. This design choice indicates an emphasis on a mystical, detailed motif rather than maintaining the authentic grayish stone texture of traditional pyramids.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the top platform of the pyramid preserved as a flat, rectangular structure with defined edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a traditional pyramid at all, but rather an imaginative, sculptural creature with an eye. Thus, it does not have a flat, rectangular structure that can be identified as the top platform of a pyramid. The design is ornate and symbolic rather than functional, lacking any defined rectangular platform consistent with real pyramid structures.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the central staircase remain aligned along the front face of the pyramid, extending from the top temple to the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure is not a conventional pyramid with a central staircase. The entire form is an artistic rendering of a creature using elements reminiscent of pyramid stairs as part of its body design, thus deviating from a traditional staircase design leading from the top to the base.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there exactly nine distinct tiers visible in the pyramid’s structure, decreasing in size from bottom to top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display a typical tiered pyramid structure. Instead, the creature-like design features an integrated fantastical pyramid-like section with no clear tiers, focusing more on fluid natural patterns rather than distinct, decreasing tiers. This artistic approach diverges from a historical tiered pyramid layout.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are patches of moss and small vegetation visible along the edges and steps of the pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the creature with elaborate vine-like and floral decorations, which are part of the creature's design rather than moss on a pyramid's edge or steps. The presence of foliage is stylized as ornamental rather than naturally occurring on pyramid surfaces.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the shadow cast by the pyramid positioned to the lower right, consistent with sunlight coming from the upper left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image in Image B does not contain a pyramid casting a shadow. Instead, the image depicts a standalone sculpture-like creature set against a dark background, without any clear indication of shadow direction like those in natural sunlight conditions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the pyramid located in the center of a dense tropical jungle, with trees surrounding it on all sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a pyramid in any location at all. Instead, it features a fantastical creature, likely situated in an ethereal setting. Therefore, there is no element of a dense jungle surrounding a pyramid.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the top platform of the pyramid covered with dry soil and patches of moss, indicating natural overgrowth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image does not display a pyramid with a top platform where dry soil and moss could naturally accumulate. The artistic depiction focuses on a decorative look that might include vegetation as part of the design, rather than realistic depictions of overgrowth on structures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Are there multiple white vehicles parked on the grassy area near the base of the pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no depiction of vehicles or a grassy area is evident. The image focuses on a creature-like structure in an environment that lacks the real-world elements like vehicles or recognizably utilitarian features related to pyramids from everyday contexts.",
