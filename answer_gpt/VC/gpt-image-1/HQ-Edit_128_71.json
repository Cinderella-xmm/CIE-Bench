      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue visible within the lantern has its right arm extended upwards, holding a torch.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the statue inside the lantern with its left arm grasping what resembles a tablet. The Statue of Liberty traditionally holds a tablet with its left hand, which is inscribed with the date of the American Declaration of Independence. This conclusion is reached by identifying the visual shape and position consistent with commonly known representations of the statue.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue within the lantern possesses a crown with pointed spikes radiating from the top of its head. The Statue of Liberty's crown is designed with seven spikes, symbolizing the seven continents and seas. This is determined by counting the visible spikes located around the statue's head.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The statue in Image B, represented within the lantern, is adorned in a robe with visible folding lines. The traditional depiction of the Statue of Liberty includes a classical robe displaying defined vertical and horizontal folds. This can be discerned from the visual representation of the fabric's texture on the statue.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue observed inside the lantern exhibits a greenish-blue coloring, characteristic of verdigris which develops on copper structures over time due to patination. The Statue of Liberty is historically known to have taken on this hue, distinguishable by the surface color visible in the image.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, the statue depicted in the lantern stands erect, with one arm (the right) raised holding a torch and the other arm (the left) lowered, holding a tablet. This positioning is typical for the Statue of Liberty and is deduced through the analysis of the arm and hand positions combined with recognizing traditional iconography.",
