    "Question": "Q1: Is the 'Gibson' logo in gold script visible on the headstock?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the headstock area is transformed into the neck of a dragon, which does not display the 'Gibson' logo. Instead, it features luminescent runes inconsistent with the traditional 'Gibson' logo appearance observed on guitars. Therefore, the Gibson logo is not visible in this image.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are there exactly six fiery tendrils extending from the bridge to the headstock area?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the guitar strings have been artistically altered to resemble fiery tendrils in line with a fantasy theme. There appear to be exactly six distinct fiery tendrils extending from the bridge upward, reflecting the typical number of strings on a guitar, hence indicating the intended six-string representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the guitar oriented vertically with the neck pointing upward?",
    "explanation": "Image B features the guitar held by a dragon, integrated into the dragon's body such that the guitar remains oriented roughly vertically, similar to how a guitar would traditionally be held when playing upright. The neck area, while merged with the dragon's anatomy and featuring illuminated runes, is still directed upwards.",
    "answer": "Yes"
