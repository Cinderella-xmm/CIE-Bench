    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the central character (derived from the green block) positioned exactly in the middle of the composition, surrounded by other characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a scene where a green block character is proposing with a ring to a red block character, surrounded by two smaller red block characters. The central green block character indeed appears to occupy the middle of the overall composition and to be the focal point of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the characters derived from the blocks retain the circular stud pattern on their upper surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green block character retains the circular stud pattern observable on its upper surface, consistent with the original block design, suggesting the characters keep this aspect.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the characters derived from the blocks primarily composed of rectangular or boxy shapes, preserving the original block geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The characters in Image B, inspired by block shapes, appear predominantly rectangular and box-shaped similar to the original block geometry, evident in their structure and form.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the composition filled with a dense cluster of characters (originally blocks), arranged in a piled, overlapping manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents individual characters standing apart in a scene with a heart-themed background, rather than being densely clustered or piled on top of one another.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there only one character (derived from the green block) that differs in color or design from the surrounding characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a green block character, distinctly different in color compared to the surrounding red block characters, indicating it is the sole character diverging in color and design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the characters derived from the blocks retain any visual indication of interlocking mechanisms (such as recessed areas or connectors)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The characters in Image B do not display visual indications of interlocking mechanisms such as recessed areas or connectors; they are stylized for expressive animation rather than functional assembly.",
