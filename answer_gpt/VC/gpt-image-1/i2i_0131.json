    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the refrigerators depicted with a stainless steel finish and reflective surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows four different views of what appears to be a refrigerator with a metallic surface that usually corresponds to stainless steel, reflecting light subtly, confirming a reflective texture. Such a finish is typical for modern kitchen appliances due to its sleek and professional look.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do both refrigerators retain the double-door design with water/ice dispensers located on the freezer compartments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the multiple views of a double-door refrigerator are visible, and water/ice dispensers are apparent on the door. Modern double-door refrigerators often have the freezer on one side, typically featuring a dispenser on this side, making the location consistent.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the refrigerators displayed in their original proportions and sizes relative to each other, without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B provides multiple angles of the refrigerator, maintaining a consistent appearance without any notable distortion or proportion alteration. Each angle complements the others, forming a cohesive understanding of the refrigerator's dimensions.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the control panels and water/ice dispensers positioned correctly on the freezer doors, consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the control panels and dispensers are positioned on one of the doors, matching common designs where these features are typically on the freezer compartment in double-door configurations. This setup remains logically consistent with typical refrigerator design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B provides isolated views of the refrigerator, not showing any surrounding cabinetry. Based on these isolated views, it is not possible to confirm any design elements beyond the refrigerator itself.",
