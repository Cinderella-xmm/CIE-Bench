      "question": "Does the edited image retain a humanoid robot with a distinct head, torso, arms, and legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, we observe a robot figure with clear humanoid features. The robot has a head, torso, arms, and legs that are distinctly visible, similar to typical humanoid designs. This observation is based on the visual cues of the structured and articulated parts of the robot that represent a human-like shape.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image includes flamingos in a stylized form. These birds are arranged around the robot, and their distinct long necks and curved beaks resemble typical flamingo features. The stylization gives them a more symmetrical and artistic representation.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, instead of a sandy beach and a body of water, there is an artistic representation with mountains, palm trees, and stylized forms. This background setting diverges from a realistic depiction and focuses more on geometric and landscape elements.",

      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot in the edited image is positioned among flamingos, surrounded by them in a stylized form. The flamingos are part of the artistic composition with the robot centered within their layout, integrating them into the scene.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, palm trees are clearly visible, contributing to the artistic background design, while rock formations are replaced with mountain-like structures in a stylized manner. Thus, the palm trees are part of the visual elements but rocks are not present.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot in the edited image is shown standing upright, with its two legs distinctly depicted, maintaining a stable pose typical of humanoid robots. This upright stance is clearly visible and reflects a typical posture for robots designed to resemble human figures.",
