    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there exactly four dragons, one in each quadrant of the cover?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a wooden puzzle with a central compass design that is divided into four quadrants. Within each quadrant, there is a depiction of a dragon. These dragons are stylistically similar and positioned in each of the four quadrants of the central design, which fits the description of having exactly four dragons.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a central circular compass composed of concentric rings with inscribed characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central part of the puzzle features a compass design consisting of concentric rings. These rings appear to have intricate inscriptions on them, which suggest the presence of characters. This matches the description of a central circular compass composed of concentric rings with inscribed characters.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a star-shaped pointer located at the center of the compass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The center of the compass in Image B features a star-like design that serves as a pointer for the compass. This star-shaped pointer is an integral part of the compass design and is clearly visible.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the dragons arranged symmetrically around the central compass, with each facing toward the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragons are positioned around the central compass, and each seems to be oriented in a way that they are directed towards the center. This creates a sense of symmetry as they are evenly distributed in a balanced manner on all sides around the compass.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the dragons separated by cross-shaped lines dividing the cover into four equal quadrants?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a wooden puzzle with cross-like separations that divide the design into four quadrants. Within each of these quadrants, a dragon is positioned, indicating that the dragons are indeed separated by cross-shaped lines.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there Chinese characters inscribed within the concentric rings of the central compass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The concentric rings within the central compass of Image B appear to contain small, intricate inscriptions that resemble characters. While it's not explicitly confirmed they are Chinese characters, the style and placement are commonly used for such inscriptions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the dragons have coiled bodies with raised heads and extended claws, consistent with traditional Chinese dragon depictions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dragons depicted in Image B have bodies shown as swirling or coiled with their heads raised and claws extended outward. This matches traditional depictions of Chinese dragons, which often feature serpentine bodies and expressive postures.",
