      "question": "Do both bears retain their round and fluffy body shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear maintains a round and fluffy body shape, consistent with typical teddy bear characteristics, such as a plump torso and rounded limbs. Since there is only one bear in Image B, there is no possibility to compare it to another bear.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bears still seated next to each other, maintaining their companionship pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is only one bear shown, which means there can't be any seated bear companion maintaining a companionship pose. The notion of companionship requires the presence of more than one bear.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the background still include a clear sky with soft clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the background is a plain beige or neutral color with no depiction of a sky or clouds. The setting suggests an indoor environment rather than an outdoor scene with visible skies.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there still small flowers, including daisies, on the grass around the bears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a solitary bear, positioned against a plain background without any depiction of grass or flowers. Thus, the environment lacks these floral elements seen in open outdoor settings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear displays clear paw pads on its feet, which is a typical feature of teddy bears, indicating intentional design details added for visual interest.",
