        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the swirling vortex texture characteristic of Van Gogh's night sky is evident across the painting. The distinctive circular and spiral forms are retained, contributing to the dynamic motion and expressiveness.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crescent moon remains clearly visible in the upper right corner.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the position and shape of the village and the tall church spire beneath the night sky, similar to the characteristics seen in the original artwork (Image A).

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the edited image introduces a glowing effect with neon-like luminescence, the impasto texture and dynamic brushstrokes characteristic of Van Gogh's style are still noticeable. These elements, which involve thick, expressive paint application evident in 'The Starry Night,' are retained in the edited image’s representation.",
