      "question": "Is the subject's serene expression with the subtle smile retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face of the subject is blurred, making it impossible to identify any facial expressions. Typically, the Mona Lisa is known for its serene expression and subtle smile, but in this edited image, those features cannot be assessed.",

      "question": "Is the subject wearing a dark garment with a gold-trimmed neckline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the subject is wearing a garment that appears to be dark brown or black with a neckline that seems to be slightly lighter but not particularly gold. The garment does not show any distinctive gold trimming. In Image A, the dark garment is consistent with what is traditionally seen on the Mona Lisa, including some lighter accents, but not distinctly gold trim.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the subject's arms crossed in front of her at the waist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's arms are visible, with one arm resting on top of the other, crossed at the waist area. This pose is consistent with the classic pose seen in Image A, where the subject's hands are similarly positioned in a folded manner across the waist.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes elements such as a winding river and distant mountains, depicted in a stylized manner that aligns with the original scenic design of the Mona Lisa in Image A, where similar geographic features are present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Is the subject centrally positioned within the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the subject positioned centrally within the frame, with the body and visible shoulders equally spaced within the image boundaries. The central positioning remains consistent with Image A, where the subject is similarly centered in the composition.",
