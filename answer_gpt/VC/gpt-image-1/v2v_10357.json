      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teddy bear appears to be wearing the same attire as in Image A. The helmet is distinctly white, and the blue cape is visible flowing behind the bear, consistent with the original image. The geometric and color composition suggests that the shapes and colors remain unchanged, indicating that the helmet and cape persist in both images.",

      "question": "Is the teddy bear still golden-brown with black button eyes and a brown nose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear exhibits a similar golden-brown color as in Image A. Although the stylization uses geometric shapes to represent the texture, the color palette reflects a golden-brown hue. While specific details like the eyes and nose are less distinct due to the style of the edit, the overall impression of the color and form points to a similar teddy bear representation.",

      "question": "Does the motorcycle retain its overall shape with a round headlight, two wheels, and handlebars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the geometric rendering in Image B, the fundamental structure of the motorcycle is preserved. The round headlight, two wheels, and handlebars are all identifiable in the edited version, mirroring their arrangement from Image A. This retention of core structural elements indicates that the motorcycle retains its original shape and components.",

      "question": "Is the teddy bear still seated on the motorcycle in a similar posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear is positioned in a way that resembles its seating in Image A. The positioning of its arms over the handlebars and its body orientation suggest that the posture remains largely unchanged. This parallels the original setup, confirming the bear's similar seating posture on the motorcycle.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes a large mountain resembling Sugarloaf Mountain as seen in Image A. The triangular, iconic shape remains discernible despite the polygonal stylization, maintaining the landmark's recognizable silhouette. This suggests that Sugarloaf Mountain remains visible in the edited image.",
