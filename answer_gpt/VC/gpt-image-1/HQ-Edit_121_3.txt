    "Question": "Q1: Is the central flower beneath the butterfly a pink coneflower with a prominent spiky central cone and drooping pink petals?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central flower beneath the butterfly-like structure has pink petals and a prominent central cone. However, the central cone does not have a spiky appearance, and instead, the structure above it resembles a stylized butterfly formed from leaves and flower petals rather than a real butterfly. The flower itself is stylized and less naturalistic compared to a traditional pink coneflower with a spiky central cone.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the butterfly positioned directly above the central cone of the flower, with its body aligned vertically over it?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly-like figure is created by leaves and petals stemming from the central flower, giving the appearance of wings. The structure is symmetrical and vertically aligned over the central flower, similar to the previous image, but is not a real butterfly.",
    "answer": "Yes"
