    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the large tree trunk with textured bark positioned on the left side of the image, partially obscuring the rear wheel of the bicycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a tree positioned on the left side of the image, but the style is illustrative and doesn't showcase textured bark like a realistic photograph. It does not obscure the rear wheel of the bicycle, as seen from the clear visibility of both wheels. World knowledge of chibi and simplistic art styles indicates that details like bark texture might be omitted for stylistic reasons.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the bicycle make direct contact with the tree trunk, leaning against it on its left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycle is positioned close to the tree, but it is not leaning against it. The visual representation shows space between the two objects. This can be concluded from the illustrative artistic style, which tends to simplify the drawing and depict objects simply and clearly without complex interactions like leaning.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a continuous road stretching from the foreground into the background, aligned horizontally across the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a path where two children are cycling, but it does not stretch horizontally across the image into the background. The path curves and is positioned more vertically or diagonally rather than horizontally aligned. Illustrative art often simplifies or stylizes the depiction of elements such as roads.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there exactly three motorcyclists riding in a straight line along the road in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of motorcyclists, there are two children riding bicycles on a path. They are not in a straight line, and the theme is presented in a more whimsical style that differs significantly from the realistic imagery of motorcyclists.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the bicycle located on the left side of the image, with the road and motorcyclists positioned to the right and extending into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bicycle in Image B is indeed located on the left side, but instead of a road with motorcyclists, there is a path with children on bicycles extending into the distance. The layout somewhat mimics the original structure but with different elements and purpose, aligned with a more child-friendly, animated environment.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the rear wheel of the bicycle partially obscured by the tree trunk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rear wheel of the bicycle is not obscured by the tree trunk and is fully visible. This illustration style allows each element to be clearly distinct, unlike a realistic photo where objects might naturally overlap due to perspective.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a round headlight mounted on the front fork of the bicycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, in Image B, there is a clearly illustrated round headlight mounted on the front fork of the bicycle. This detail is consistent with the original image but translated into the chibi or cute illustrative style.",
