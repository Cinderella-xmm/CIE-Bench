    {

      "question": "Is the light blue botanical pattern (leaf and vine motifs) present on the bedding in the LEGO version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bed appears to be constructed from LEGO pieces, which are commonly known to recreate textures using block designs. The bedding in Image B mimics a fabric-like texture with light blue patterns resembling leaves or vines visible upon its surface. These patterns closely correspond to botanical motifs, which confirms the presence of such botanical patterns in the LEGO version.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bedding and bed frame rendered in white with light blue accents in the LEGO version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bed frame and bedding are largely composed of white LEGO blocks. The bedding features light blue botanical patterns, providing the accents on the predominantly white bed setup, which matches the description of white with light blue accents.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there exactly two pillows stacked vertically on the left side of the bed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the pillows are represented by stacked LEGO pieces on the left side of the bed. There appear to be three individual LEGO pieces stacked, suggesting there are three pillows rather than two.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the blanket folded and positioned on the right half of the bed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blanket, indicated by the patterned surface, is indeed positioned on the right half of the bed, with visible creases implying it is folded. This placement on the right half aligns with the description.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {

      "question": "Is the background a uniform neutral gray with no additional textures or elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a solid gray color without any visible textures, patterns, or elements added. This uniformity and neutrality fit the description given.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the dark brown rectangular object visible in the upper right corner of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible dark brown rectangular object present in the upper right corner; the background is entirely gray. Thus, this object is absent in this version.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the bed positioned horizontally and centered within the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bed positioned horizontally, spanning from left to right across the image. However, it is more aligned towards the lower side than the center, with more space appearing on top. This suggests the bed is not perfectly centered vertically but is centered horizontally.",
