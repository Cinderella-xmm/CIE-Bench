      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object designed to resemble a cocktail glass maintains a cylindrical shape with a flat base, which are essential characteristics of a standard cocktail glass. Even though Image B appears to be crafted using a clay-like material, these basic geometric features remain identifiable.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts what appears to be a cocktail with elements resembling ice cubes. While they are not realistically rendered, the clay-like blocks inside the glass are intended to represent ice cubes, preserving the visual suggestion of a chilled drink.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows an object that mimics a slice of lime positioned on the rim of the glass. It is crafted to resemble the general shape and color of a lime, appearing as expected in a cocktail garnish position.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an object closely resembling a straw inserted into the drink. While the material and texture appear like clay, it mimics the form of a straw typically found in cocktails, maintaining the expected function but not the metallic aspect.",
