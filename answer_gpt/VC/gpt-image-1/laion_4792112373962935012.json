      "question": "Is the cocktail liquid pale yellow in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cocktail liquid is illustrated as a vibrant yellow, which contrasts with the paler yellow typically associated with real cocktails. It emphasizes a more artistic style rather than a realistic depiction. Therefore, based on common understanding of 'pale yellow' and the strong color in the illustration, this depiction does not qualify as pale yellow.",

      "question": "Does the lime wedge have a bright green outer rind and visible segmented interior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the illustration of Image B, the lime wedge is cartoonishly drawn with a green rind and a light green interior. However, the segmented detail seen in natural lime wedges is not depicted as it would be naturally segmented. Artistic styles often simplify such textures.",

      "question": "Is the rim of the glass coated with a speckled mixture of white and red granules?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the glass rim with a stylized representation that embraces a broader artistic touch, showing granules that appear white and red. It uses a pattern that suggests the concept of speckled granules, identifiable through the cartoonish design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there multiple translucent, angular ice cubes visible inside the glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration in Image B shows ice cubes inside the glass. They are drawn in a simplified manner typical of cartoon styles and appear more solid due to the artistic preference, rather than realistically translucent. Despite the style, they are suggested to be ice cubes inside the glass shape.",

      "question": "Is the glass placed on a dark blue surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Rather than being placed on a surface, Image B presents the glass in a floating position amidst a vivid orange background with additional festive decorations, following a dynamic and celebration-themed design. The setting does not align with any specific surface color, let alone a dark blue one.",
