    "Question": "Q1: Does the lion’s silhouette retain the distinct, wide, rounded mane shape around its head and neck?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette of the lion clearly shows a mane that is wide and rounded, extending significantly around the head and neck area. This typical mane shape is commonly associated with male lions and is discernible even in silhouette form, as it helps differentiate the appearance of a lion from other animals. The edited image successfully captures this characteristic, using solid coloring to keep the mane's shape visible.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the lion depicted with its front legs forward and rear legs bent, maintaining a poised, dominant stance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette of the lion shows the front legs extending forward while the rear legs appear bent. This posture suggests readiness or motion, indicative of a dominant, poised stance typical of lions as seen in nature and depicted frequently in artistic representations of the 'king of the jungle.' The decision to maintain this pose in silhouette accentuates the lion's powerful presence.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the lion’s head turned slightly toward the viewer, rather than fully in profile?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents the lion's silhouette with the head in full profile. Observing the silhouette reveals that there is no indication of the head being turned towards the viewer; the side view is completely in profile. The angle does not suggest any turning or tilting of the head towards the foreground viewer in the edited representation.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there grass present in the foreground beneath the lion?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a texture in the silhouette that appears to be grass in the foreground beneath the lion. This depiction utilizes dark shapes at the bottom to create an effect of layering, commonly used to symbolize grass or vegetation. Such inclusion provides depth and grounding to the scene, often used in artistic silhouettes to retain environmental context.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are acacia trees visible in the background, either as natural forms or stylized silhouettes?",
    "explanation": "Image B illustrates acacia trees in the background and they are presented as stylized silhouettes. This form of depiction is typical when capturing African savannah scenes to emphasize the characteristic umbrella-like shape of acacia trees. The silhouettes add clarity while maintaining the atmospheric and geographical essence of the setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the lion positioned in the foreground, centered and large in scale relative to the background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lion is firmly centered within the frame and is notably large compared to the background elements such as the acacia trees. This positioning and scaling is a deliberate choice to emphasize the lion's presence as the focal point, reflecting its status as 'king of the wild.' Such compositional focus suggests importance and dominance in portraying the lion amidst its backdrop.",
    "answer": "Yes"
