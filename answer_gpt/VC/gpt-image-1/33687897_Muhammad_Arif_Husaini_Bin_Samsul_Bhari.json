    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the silhouetted tree branches in the foreground clearly visible and retaining their original shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouetted tree branches are visible; however, their relative position to the new central object—a large dragon—is different compared to Image A. The branches in Image B frame this new object, indicating a change in the scene's main subjects and their positioning. Therefore, while the branches are visible, their context in the composition has altered.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the small green hilltop with sparse vegetation visible just above the mist layer in the mid-ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a dragon occupying the mid-ground where the small green hilltop appears in Image A. Although there is greenery around the base of the dragon in Image B, the distinct appearance of the hilltop is obscured and visually replaced, meaning it is not clearly visible as its own entity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sky retain its original gradient from deep blue at the top to soft pink and lavender near the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky indeed shows a gradient similar to Image A, transitioning from deep blue at the top to softer hues near the horizon. This consistent gradient color transition is visible over both images and thus remains unchanged in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a continuous layer of mist or fog extending horizontally beneath the mountain, obscuring its lower slopes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a layer of mist or fog, but the representation has altered compared to Image A. In Image B, the mist now surrounds the dragon, emphasizing its ethereal presence rather than obscuring any landscape features similar to the mountain in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the foreground trees, mid-ground hill, and background mountain arranged in their original relative positions, maintaining the depth of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the placement of elements differs significantly from Image A. While the foreground tree silhouettes are still present, the mid-ground and background arrangement has been altered to feature a large dragon instead of a hill and mountain, fundamentally changing the depth and spatial arrangement of the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the tree branches retain their original fine details, including individual twigs and leaf clusters, in silhouette form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, tree branches are portrayed in silhouette, showcasing fine details with individual twigs and leaf clusters visible. Despite the integration of the dragon in Image B, the silhouetted branch details remain evident as per Image A's original style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the peak of the mountain still positioned at the highest point in the scene, serving as the central focal point?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain peak is replaced by the dragon, which now serves as the central focal point. The mountain's peak is therefore no longer the highest point or the center of attention within the composition of this new scene.",
