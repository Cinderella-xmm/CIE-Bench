    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the woman's facial structure, including her eyes, nose, and mouth, preserved in their original form and positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's facial structure is stylized in a chibi form, which is characterized by exaggerated features with a simplified, cartoon-like appearance. The eyes are large and round, the nose is not prominent, and the mouth is a simple curved line, which is typical for chibi art. This style is not consistent with the realistic facial structure seen in Image A, where the features are detailed and proportionate to a human face. Hence, in Image B, the facial structure and positioning have been significantly altered.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dark hair arranged in an updo with a blue ribbon placed on the left side of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair is depicted as dark and styled in an updo, which is traditionally seen in the 19th-century styling and similar to Image A. The chibi version explicitly features a blue ribbon on the left side of the head, as indicated by the prominent bow visual on that side. This aligns with the description suggesting accurate portrayal of the hair and accessory positioning.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the dress designed with an off-the-shoulder neckline that exposes the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress reflects a chibi simplification of a 19th-century gown. It is designed with a scalloped, off-the-shoulder neckline, revealing the shoulders, which is characteristic of formal attire from the period the original art represents. The style remains consistent with the off-the-shoulder look observed in the real painting of Image A.",

      "question": "Is there a golden necklace with a pendant visible around the woman’s neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a golden necklace with a round pendant is clearly depicted around the woman's neck. This aligns with the historical accessory style shown in Image A, wherein a similar necklace and pendant are visible, though they are in a more simplified form in the chibi representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a ring visible on the woman’s right hand, specifically on the ring finger?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi form focuses on broad visual elements, and fine details like rings might not be prominently visible. Observing the illustration, the woman's right hand shows simplified hands without specific ring details, diverging from the detailed realism seen in Image A where a ring is visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the red-and-gold heraldic crest visible in the upper-right corner of the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, in its simplified and caricatured form, does not include detailed background elements such as a heraldic crest. The design concentrates more on the main subject rather than ancillary elements. In comparison, Image A prominently features a crest in the upper-right, showing removal or exclusion in the chibi adaptation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s arms are not crossed across her chest but instead are placed gracefully with hands resting on her lap or nearby furniture, similar to Image A. This detail aligns with traditional portraiture seating and does not represent crossed arms.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character features large, expressive eyes that appear to be looking directly at the viewer with an open and straightforward gaze. This artistic choice aligns with chibi styles aimed at creating a cute and engaging character. This aspect has been maintained from the realistic portraiture in Image A, where the subject also faces forward.",
