      "question": "Are there exactly three chairs positioned in a row, facing the bookshelf wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a whimsical illustration featuring birds, trees, and glowing mushrooms. There are no chairs or bookshelf walls depicted. Given this, we can conclusively say there are no chairs positioned in a row or facing any bookshelf wall in this image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there two hanging pendant lights located above the seating area, one closer to the center and one toward the right edge of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a seating area as it contains a whimsical forest scene with birds and glowing mushrooms. There are mushroom-like elements emitting light, but they do not resemble pendant lights above a seating area as described. Thus, the configuration described in the question doesn't exist in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no identifiable floor present. Instead, the forest floor appears in a natural scenery without structured shadows typical of sunlight through slats or windows. The ambiance is more magical with a glowing effect from mushrooms, rather than sunlight casting shadows.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B represents a forest scene without any architectural features such as walls or shelves. The primary elements are trees, glowing mushrooms, and bird-like figures. Therefore, there isn't a full-height wall of wooden shelves in Image B.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floor in Image B is not composed of wooden planks but is part of an illustrated forest scene. The scene does not feature any flooring typical of an indoor setting and thus doesn't have any wooden planks.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no shelves or cubbies in Image B. The image displays a forest with trees and birds, and there aren't any visible decorative objects like vases or boxes present. Therefore, Image B doesn't include objects placed within shelf cubbies.",
