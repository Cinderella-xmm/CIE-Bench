      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the two visible dark brown wooden ceiling beams, one running diagonally and one vertically, present and positioned as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main subject is a jellyfish with intricate designs, set against a deep blue background representing an underwater setting. There is no ceiling or beams present in this environment, as it is an artistic depiction of a sea creature, not a room or interior space. Therefore, the item cannot be present as there is no ceiling context. The comparison to Image A, which shows a lamp in a room with ceiling beams, highlights the absence of such structural elements in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the white, hand-textured stucco wall visible on the left side of the image, showing irregular surface imperfections and subtle brushwork marks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes an artistic visualization of a jellyfish, surrounded by a smooth, deep blue background typical of underwater scenes. There are no walls, textures, or brushwork marks present as the focus is on marine life, not architectural details. White stucco wall elements in Image A contrast with Image B's depiction of the ocean environment, making the wall's presence illogical in the edited image.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the shadow pattern on the ceiling and wall composed of a radial, star-shaped lattice formed by the lantern’s cut-out design, matching the exact geometric configuration of the lantern’s panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) portrays a jellyfish with detailed designs on its body and tentacles. There is no ceiling or room to cast shadows, nor a lantern to create patterns with a cut-out design. Therefore, shadows and lighting effects related to a lantern in a room cannot exist in the underwater setting portrayed here. Image A is where the shadow patterns are relevant, but they do not apply to Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the corner where the white wall meets the wooden ceiling clearly visible, forming a sharp right-angle edge at the upper left portion of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting is an open underwater space, represented by a jellyfish in deep blue water. The concept of walls and ceilings, including corners, is not applicable in this context. Image A’s depiction of a room with right-angle corners contrasts with the lack of such structures in Image B, which focuses solely on marine life imagery.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the metal chain, consisting of small linked rings, visibly connecting the top of the lantern to the ceiling fixture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) showcases a jellyfish, surrounded by a seamless blue environment typical of underwater scenes. There is no ceiling or fixture to attach a chain. The elements of Image A including the chain, which connects the lamp to the ceiling, do not translate to Image B’s aquatic setting, ruling out the presence of any ceiling fixtures or chains.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the light emanate from within the central chamber of the lantern, creating a bright focal point that radiates outward through the perforated panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a jellyfish emitting a soft glow, particular to bioluminescent creatures. This glow spreads outward naturally in the aquatic environment, not emanating from a lantern or fixed light source like in a room setting. In Image A, the light from the lantern features a central light source with defined panels; however, Image B’s jellyfish displays organic and dispersed light, more in line with ocean life rather than interior design.",
