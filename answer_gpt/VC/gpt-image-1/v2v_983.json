    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the tan and black fur color distribution, particularly the tan face and legs with black back, preserved in the creature’s design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature's design features a tan face and tan legs with a black back, matching the dog's color distribution in Image A. The common elements of color distribution are identifiable in both images, despite the stylistic differences. The tan fur on the face and legs and the darker fur along the back are consistent between the realistic dog and the cartoon design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floppy ears, with their rounded shape and downward angle, preserved in the creature’s head design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature has ears that are more pointed and angular, pointing upwards, unlike the dog from Image A which has distinct rounded floppy ears that angle downward. This indicates a deviation in ear design from the original to the edited image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the open mouth with a visible pink tongue and exposed teeth preserved in the creature’s facial expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature is depicted with an open mouth showing a pink tongue prominently, similar to the dog's expression in Image A, where the mouth is open with a visible tongue. The exposure of teeth is less evident in the cartoon style due to simplification, but the key elements like the tongue are preserved.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the blue collar with a black buckle present on the creature, either as part of its design or reflected in the orb’s color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature retains a blue collar with what appears to be a simplified buckle, replicating the dog's distinctive accessory from Image A. The orb features similar blue coloring, reinforcing this design choice, though it's not the collar itself but additional design elements.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the creature depicted in a lying-down pose with front paws extended forward, mirroring the dog’s original posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature is illustrated in a standing pose with its legs positioned for movement, which contrasts with the dog's relaxed, lying-down posture in Image A. This depicts a notable change in the pose between the original and edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature maintains dark eyes and a dark nose against a tan muzzle, closely following the dog's facial features seen in Image A. These elements are consistent in both images, reflecting similar facial characteristics despite the artistic style.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the creature retain the medium-sized, muscular body proportions of the original dog, including a broad chest and defined back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature is depicted with simplified, cartoonish proportions, emphasizing features like a broad chest and defined back, similar in essence to the dog's medium-sized, muscular build in Image A. The style is noticeably different, yet the core muscular and chest features are reflected.",
