      "question": "Is there a bench positioned on the left side of the porch, facing inward toward the cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a rocking chair drawn on the left side of the porch, facing inward toward what would be the cabin. The rocking chair appears as part of a stylized illustration, lacking the detail to be specifically identified as a bench, but given its positioning and orientation, this is consistent with the concept of seating. Comparing with Image A, there is a chair visible in the same location. However, since the question specifies a 'bench,' the equivalent seating in Image B does not resemble a bench. Therefore, the best answer is based on the specific terminology used.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a large vertical glass panel or sliding door on the front face of the cabin, emitting warm light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an outlined door with a simple design; its emphasis is not on being glass or emitting warm light. The depiction here is highly stylized, focusing more on the geometric pattern and simple shapes without indications of light emission. In contrast, Image A has a door with visible warm lighting emanating through an open door or window. However, analyzing Image B alone, thereâ€™s no clear emission of warm light from any glass panel.",

      "question": "Is there a bright circular moon located in the upper right portion of the sky, above the distant hills?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moon is indeed depicted as a bright circular shape in the sky above the distant hills. It is partly enveloped by stylized clouds, but its position is more central rather than distinctly upper right. Given the stylized nature of Image B and absence of explicit reference points, this description loosely fits the question's criteria. However, comparing with Image A, the moon is distinctly on the right side but the depiction in Image B doesn't as precisely specify its location relative to the cardinal directions.",

      "question": "Are there vertical wooden support beams forming the porch structure directly in front of the cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized illustration features clear vertical lines representing wooden support beams that form part of the porch structure. These beams are visually prominent and directly in front of what is presumably the cabin structure. The presence of these beams is consistent with typical porch architecture. Image A similarly has prominent wooden support beams shown in front of the cabin.",

      "question": "Is there visible warm interior lighting emanating from within the cabin through the glass wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible indication of warm interior lighting emanating from within the cabin. The illustration uses a palette dominated by gold and dark blue, but there is no specific styling to depict light emission in the way that Image A explicitly shows warm light emanating from the door/window. Thus, based on Image B's visual information alone, the answer is clear.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B highlights a stylized depiction of vegetation in the lower foreground with simplified flower shapes. The flowers are more artistic representations than realistic depictions and do not specifically showcase small white blossoms. In comparison, Image A does portray small, detailed blossoms in the lower right foreground. Image B does not illuminate this detail.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear depiction of dark silhouetted hills or mountains. They are placed below the moon, providing a backdrop to the scene. This aligns with typical scenic illustrations where such natural features are featured against a night sky. Comparing with Image A, a similar stylized portrayal of hills is present below the moon in both images.",
