    "Question": "Q1: Is the overall bombe (curved, outward-bulging) silhouette of the commode preserved in the LEGO version?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a LEGO version of a commode which accurately presents a bombe silhouette, characterized by its outward-bulging curves. The LEGO rendition effectively captures the swooping curves and bulbous contours typical of a bombe commode, even with the block-like nature of LEGO bricks.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there exactly two drawers stacked vertically on the front of the dresser, each framed by brass mounts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO version uses construction patterns that imply the presence of two distinctly framed areas on the front, suggesting drawers. Although LEGO bricks limit express detail, visual cues from the arrangement and symmetry of blocks imply two compartments, imitating drawers framed by brass-like detailing.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the herringbone and starburst marquetry pattern visible on the front of both drawers in the LEGO version?",
    "explanation": "Image B utilizes a pattern of LEGO pieces to mimic decorative details but does not explicitly show the intricate herringbone and starburst marquetry on the drawers. The block design suggests texture, but it lacks the intricate wooden veneer patterns found in traditional marquetry.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the ornate brass mounts with acanthus leaf scrolls present around the edges of both drawers and along the side panels?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays simulative detailing with yellow LEGO pieces resembling brass mounts, but it does not exhibit ornate acanthus leaf scrolls specifically around drawer edges and side panels. The LEGO design suggests decoration placement, but the limited scope of LEGO aesthetics cannot capture intricate leaf scrolls.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the legs curve outward in a cabriole fashion and terminate in brass sabots?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO adaptation depicts outward-curving legs mimicking cabriole style, with subtle hints of decoration at the base resembling brass sabots. However, the detailed brass elements found in brass sabots are implied rather than explicitly recreated in LEGO.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a scalloped apron below the drawers, following the curve of the bombe shape?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a streamlined base without an explicit scalloped apron, outlining the bombe shape's contour but not the detailed scalloped design found in traditional commodes.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the top surface rectangular and flush with the upper edge of the dresser body?",
    "explanation": "Image B reveals a rectangular LEGO top surface, flush with the upper edge of the dresser body, maintaining a clean silhouette consistent with commode designs where the top forms a continuous, smooth boundary.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Are the decorative elements (brass mounts, marquetry, legs) symmetrically arranged on both sides of the dresser?",
    "explanation": "The design in Image B shows symmetry in the distribution of LEGO decorative elements on both sides, mirroring traditional commode aesthetics where symmetry is an essential aspect, showcasing balance and formality.",
    "answer": "Yes"
