    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the owl perched on a moss-covered branch with visible green moss texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl is perched on a branch that is covered in what appears to be moss. However, the texture and color are less clear, and the branch has a more stylized appearance compared to natural moss, with glowing elements. The impression is more magical rather than realistic, distinct from the typical green moss texture seen in real life.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a small green plant with slender leaves growing next to the owl’s left side on the branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no indication of a small green plant with slender leaves growing next to the owl on the branch. The image has a more fantasy-like atmosphere, focusing more on glowing elements and mystical textures rather than realistic plants.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background composed of dark, out-of-focus green foliage typical of a forest environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is dark and mystical, with swirling, ethereal mist surrounding the owl. While it creates an atmospheric depth, it does not resemble typical out-of-focus green foliage found in a natural forest environment.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the owl facing directly toward the camera with a slight head tilt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl is indeed facing directly toward the viewer. However, due to the mystical depiction, its expression is more intense and stylized. There is no obvious head tilt present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the branch have a rough, textured surface covered in green moss with visible patches and crevices?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the branch has a smoother, more stylized appearance rather than a rough, textured one. The branch, part of the overall fantasy theme, lacks the realistic patchy and creviced moss texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the lighting dim and natural, with subtle highlights on the owl’s feathers and eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is dim but not natural. It leans towards a mystical or enchanted theme with glowing highlights, especially on the owl’s feathers and eyes, providing an unnatural glow rather than subtle and natural lighting.",
