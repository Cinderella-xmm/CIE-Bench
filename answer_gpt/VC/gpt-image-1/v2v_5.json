      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object that resembles a zebra is presented as a cartoon character with a black-and-white striped pattern, which is typical of zebra designs. The style is more simplified and stylized due to its cartoonish nature, but it retains the essential feature of zebra stripes. This is understood through common knowledge of zebra patterns and cartoon representations.",

      "question": "Does the cake retain its zebra-striped design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the cake is depicted with zebra-like black-and-white stripes. In Image B, the cake's design has been simplified and includes a zebra-striped pattern, indicating that the essential design feature has been maintained. This conclusion is drawn from visual comparison and understanding of consistent design elements.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the zebra still leaning forward toward the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon zebra is depicted in a sitting position, gazing at the cake with a forward-facing direction, similar to the original pose of the real zebra in Image A, which leans toward the cake. This is inferred from analyzing the position of the zebra's head relative to the cake in both images.",

      "question": "Is there a single lit candle on the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a cake with a single lit candle on top. This can be identified by the presence of a flame and a vertical candle on the cake, consistent with the design in Image A, where there is also one candle. This is determined by recognizing the common element of birthday cakes featuring lit candles.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake appears to be on a surface, likely a tray or small table, similar to the table surface in Image A. This can be concluded as the cake is presented with a base that suggests placement on a flat surface, consistent with typical cake presentations.",
