      "question": "Are the original seam lines (including those around the front pocket and vertical panel divisions) preserved as embossed linear patterns on the transformed glass vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed glass vessel does exhibit patterns that resemble seam lines in appearance, which are characteristic of embossed patterns on items. These can be seen on the front face of the vessel, resembling the outline of where seams and divisions might be. World knowledge suggests that embossed linear designs are often a stylistic choice to mimic fabric seams on glassware. Image A, the original suitcase, has visible seams around the front pocket and divisions, which seem to be mirrored as embossed designs on Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the brand logo positioned near the top center of the front face of the transformed object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, the brand logo appears to be located near the top center on the front face of the glass vessel, just below the handle, which is a typical area for branding on bottles. In Image A, the logo is similarly positioned near the top center but below the zippers of the suitcase. Therefore, this similarity in placement indicates that the brand logo's position has been preserved in the transformation.",

      "question": "Is the metallic spray nozzle located at the top center of the object, aligned vertically with the original handle’s position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic spray nozzle is situated at the top of the object, in the central area aligned with the handle. This vertical position mirrors the original handle placement observed in Image A, which is located at the top center. The design logic likely follows a direct transformation from a suitcase handle to a spray bottle nozzle, maintaining alignment within the object's vertical symmetry.",

      "question": "Are four decorative caps present at the base corners of the transformed object, corresponding to the original wheel positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows four circular elements located at the base corners of the glass vessel, which seem to serve a decorative purpose. These are analogous to the wheels on Image A, where similarly sized circles (the suitcase wheels) are placed at each corner of the base. The transformation keeps the wheel placement as decorative caps on Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the two zipper tracks of the front pocket preserved as linear features on the transformed object, maintaining their parallel alignment and position within the front panel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When examining Image B, there are no notable linear features that mimic the parallel zipper alignment found in Image A. The glass vessel has embossed patterns but they do not clearly correspond to two distinct, parallel lines like zippers. Thus, the zipper tracks from Image A are not explicitly preserved in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is a handle present on the right side of the transformed object, corresponding to the original side handle’s position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible handle on the right side of the transformed glass vessel. In Image A, the luggage has a pronounced side handle on its right side. The absence of such a feature in Image B indicates it was not carried over in the transformation process.",
