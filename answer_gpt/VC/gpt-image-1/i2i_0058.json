      "question": "Does the edited subject (anthropomorphic bull) maintain the rightward walking posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the anthropomorphic bull is depicted standing with both legs spread apart, not exhibiting any visible movement. The posture indicates that the bull is stationary rather than walking to the right. The armor and cape also suggest a rightward stance but not necessarily walking, as the tail is swinging rather than trailing in motion.",

      "question": "Is the saddle and seating arrangement for the riders preserved intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the saddle and seating arrangement are essential for riding the elephant. However, Image B features a clothed bull that is anthropomorphized, wearing armor instead of any riding gear or saddle arrangement. There is no saddle or seating arrangement visible in Image B.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the riders still positioned directly atop the anthropomorphic bull, maintaining their original relative height from the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the riders are seated on an elephant, naturally higher off the ground. In Image B, the bull is anthropomorphic and armored, not displaying any riders seated atop it. The bull stands alone without any reference to the original riders' height or position.",

      "question": "Does the dirt path retain its uneven and natural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a dirt path with an uneven texture, consistent with natural paths often found in wooded areas. The path appears to have variations in shading and elevation, which give it a natural appearance. Therefore, the path in Image B does retain its natural texture.",

      "question": "Is there natural foliage visible framing the sides of the path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is visible foliage on both sides of the path. The trees and greenery create a natural frame around the path, indicating a wooded or forested area, similar to what is seen in Image A, although the specific foliage pattern differs in both images.",
