      "question": "Are the carrots depicted in a bright orange color with their rounded-tapered shape preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrots are a bright orange which is typical for carrots. Their shape is rounded at the top and tapers slightly towards the bottom, which is consistent with a natural carrot shape. Visual cues like the uniform orange color and the familiar carrot shape lead to the conclusion that the depiction is consistent with natural carrots.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the carrots topped with bright green serrated leaves with a lobed appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The carrots in Image B are topped with green leaves that are serrated and have a lobed appearance. This matches the appearance of carrot tops, which typically have multi-lobed green leaves. The texture and shape of the leaves in Image B are exactly what one would expect for authentic carrot leaves.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the soil texture surrounding the carrotsâ€™ roots preserved showing they are rooted in soil rather than snow or ice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features carrots positioned in brown soil, with a clear texture of loose earth around the carrot roots. Despite a snowy background, the carrots are distinctly shown to be planted in soil instead of being directly in snow or ice. The distinct soil appearance indicates that the carrots are indeed rooted in soil.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the carrots positioned in a way that shows they are partially underground, consistent with their natural growth pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The carrots in Image B appear to be partially buried in the soil, with only the top portion and the leaves visible, which is how carrots typically grow. This positioning is consistent with their natural growth pattern, where most of a carrot develops underground.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the carrots have visible surface textures like natural ridges or marks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the carrots has visible marks and ridges that are common on real carrots. These textures enhance the realism of the depicted carrots and are typical features one would expect to see on the surface of a fresh carrot, indicating signs of natural growth.",
