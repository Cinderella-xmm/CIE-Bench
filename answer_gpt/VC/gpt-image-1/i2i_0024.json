        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis court elements like the lines are not present.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis racket is stylized into a minimalistic black shape, which is common in simplified or cartoon-style illustrations.
