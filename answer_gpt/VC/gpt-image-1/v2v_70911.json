    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the AXE logo still visible on the container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the AXE logo is prominently displayed on the front of the container. This is visible due to the recognizable branding and typography associated with AXE products. The text is clear and placed in a similar orientation, maintaining consistent visibility with typical branding practice.",

      "question": "Does the container retain its cylindrical shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a container that maintains a cylindrical form, characteristic of a hair product jar or similar cosmetic containers. This can be inferred from the circular base and vertical sides that are common in such packaging designs. Despite the dramatic modifications, such as the cracked lid, the base shape remains unchanged.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the fiery red and energetic pink hues from the label's explosive design still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the container's label continues to exhibit fiery red and pink hues, particularly visible in the label's background design and the simulated nebula effect emerging from the container. These colors match the energetic and striking design theme often used in product branding targeting a youthful audience, like AXE products.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the net weight text (\"NET WT 2.64 OZ (75g)\") still visible on the label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the net weight text ('NET WT 2.64 OZ (75g)') that was present in Image A appears to be missing from the label. The focus in Image B is primarily on the AXE logo and the dramatic visual effect of the nebula without small detailed text.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the container depicted as mostly intact, with only a crack allowing the nebula to be seen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the container is depicted with significant damage or alteration, displaying a nebula-like effect erupting from within. The edges of the container appear jagged or cracked, suggesting a more considerable disruption than a mere crack. This dramatic presentation transforms the container into something more cosmic and visually impactful.",
