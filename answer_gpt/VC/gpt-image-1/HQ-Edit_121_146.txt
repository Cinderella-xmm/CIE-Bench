    "Question": "Q1: Are the intricate floral and vine motifs present in their original pattern and spatial arrangement across the body and lid?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the floral and vine motifs are prominently displayed on the body of the candle container with clear visibility. The patterns are dense and ornate, similar to fine engravings. The lid of the candle shows no such patterning as it is a smooth, wooden structure. Without referring to Image A, these motifs are beautifully expansive but cannot be compared directly to a missing original pattern since there is no reference to see any differences or confirm exact matches with Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the central chamber rendered in a rich camel red hue matching the original teapot’s body color?",
    "explanation": "On analyzing Image B independently, it showcases a rich, luxurious red on the candle's body. The color choice appears consistent without needing reference; it's a deep, warm hue complementary to the ornate decoration. However, without seeing Image A’s hue directly, it is presumed similar due to the same cultural and aesthetic styling. The absence of side-by-side comparison limits precise hue matching verification.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the contour of the teapot handle clearly visible and accurately preserved?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the depicted object is a luxury candle, which does not feature a handle in any form. Instead, a wooden lid with a top grip sculpture is seen. The handle, therefore, is not preserved as there is no such feature visible in the candle jar structure, differing from the description of Image A's teapot.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the spout’s curved, elongated shape preserved without alteration?",
    "explanation": "Image B is a luxury candle, and as such, it does not have any spout at all. This object is entirely different in function, lacking any pouring mechanism. Comparing to the presumed existence of a teapot spout in Image A, this feature is entirely absent, leading to a conclusion that no preservation could occur.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the base structure, including its decorative silver band, preserved in form and position?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the candle does not display the characteristics of a silver band. The design is simpler, more focused on stability rather than ornamentation. Without analyzing Image A directly, one can infer an absence of ornamental silver band structure. Assessing for preservation, the difference in object types leads to a lack of continuity in design elements, as well as purpose.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the metallic details still rendered with embossed, raised textures rather than flat or painted designs?",
    "explanation": "Reviewing Image B, it is clear that the ornamental motif is implemented using what appears to be a raised texture consistent with embossed metalwork. The patterns are visually three-dimensional, maintaining a believable depth on the candle jar. Without Image A, we assume the texture to remain raised but prominently present in representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the body of the object still a rounded, bulbous form consistent with the original teapot’s shape?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a cylindrical luxury candle jar, distinguishable from a rounded, bulbous teapot form. The structure is straightforward and vertical, lacking any bulbous outward expansion typical of many tea vessels. With no direct reference to Image A, the shapes are logically consistent with the understanding of differing object utilities.",
    "answer": "No"
