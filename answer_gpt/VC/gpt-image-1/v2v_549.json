        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Funko Pop-style figure in Image B is sporting a grey baseball uniform with a dark blue helmet, similar to the player's attire in Image A. The uniform's color scheme, including the main grey color and the dark blue accents, align closely with each other.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Funko Pop-style figure is depicted with a baseball bat in its hand, which is a typical characteristic of a baseball player. The display of the bat alongside the figure indicates an intention to represent a baseball player, confirming the presence of the bat.",

      "question": "Does the Funko Pop-style figure maintain a similar posture to the original player while holding the bat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original player in Image A is seen in a batting stance, preparing to swing at an incoming pitch. The Funko Pop-style figure in Image B, while holding a bat, lacks this dynamic pose and is instead shown in a neutral standing position typical of these collectible figures, which usually do not replicate complex poses due to their simplistic and exaggerated design. Thus, the posture significantly differs between the figure and the original player.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses on the Funko Pop-style figure and its packaging, featuring elements like the helmet, bat, and gloves. The catcher and other game-related equipment seen in Image A, including protective gear, are absent in this marketing product scene, reflecting a focus solely on the simplified representation of a singular character's theme.",
