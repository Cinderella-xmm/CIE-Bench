        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual center of the room features a large, intricately carved stone fireplace framed by columns. This setup establishes it as a central focal point of the room, similar to common architectural designs where fireplaces serve as a prominent and central feature. Therefore, based on how rooms are commonly arranged around a fireplace, it is centrally located.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts sconces as part of the stonework surrounding the fireplace. These sconces are integrated into the design and enhanced with lights that might resemble torches or traditional candle holders.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area above the fireplace is dominated by a carved stone pediment heavily featuring religious or classical motifs, complete with statues flanking the sides. This differs from Image A where decorative items were placed above the fireplace, and it showcases more permanent, architectural embellishments, rather than movable decorative items.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two large sofas are positioned opposite each other with the round coffee table in between, all directly oriented towards the fireplace.
