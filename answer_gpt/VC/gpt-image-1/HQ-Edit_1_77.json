      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the multi-layered beaded neckpiece composed of alternating red, white, blue, and black horizontal bands still present in the same layered structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neckpiece is still present and is composed of an intricate pattern of beads. It appears around the neck with a similar distribution of layers as in Image A, where red, white, blue, and black colors create a rich pattern. The visual cues strongly suggest that this multi-colored layering is maintained, though it may be stylized in the edited image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the central red vertical thread extend downward from the center of the neckpiece?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neckpiece includes a prominent feature where a red thread extends vertically from its center downward, which is indicated by the similar appearance in traditional beadwork where a central element or thread is often used for symmetry and design balance. This feature seems consistent with traditional designs and is present in the originally described pattern.",

      "question": "Is the blue-and-white beaded headband positioned across the forehead with silver-like dangling strands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a headband is visible that matches the blue-and-white color scheme. However, the silver-like dangling strands are not clearly depicted as they were in Image A, suggesting an artistic difference. The visual focus on beading retains a sense of intricate design, yet the specific strands are not evident.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are red bead-like elements visibly integrated into the hair above the headband?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hairstyle includes visually distinct red bead-like elements integrated above the headband. These elements contribute to the cultural design and enhance the detailed, textured appearance, consistent with traditional hair ornaments.",

      "question": "Are there beaded bracelets on both forearms, featuring the same red, white, blue, and black color pattern as the necklaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beaded bracelets visible on the arms do not replicate the same color pattern as the necklaces. Although the adornments on the arms are present and colorful, they differ in detail and color from the neckpiece, suggesting a variation in design approach.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of adornments is consistent with typical traditional dress. The necklaces appear high on the neck, the headband sits on the forehead, and bracelets are positioned on the upper forearm. Such positioning reflects traditional wear and exhibits a coherence in placement as indicated by the descriptions in Image A.",
