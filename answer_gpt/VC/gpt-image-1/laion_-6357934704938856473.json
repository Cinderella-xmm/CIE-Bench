        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which features a model of a robot, the robot's face does not show distinctive red eye lenses. Instead, the entire model appears to have a uniform metallic or bronze color scheme, which means the details such as color lenses are either subdued or omitted due to the model's monochrome styling.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the robot holding a sword with its right hand, as seen from the viewer’s perspective. The sword appears straight and is positioned to the right of the robot. Therefore, there is no long, straight sword being held in the robot's left hand.",
