    "Question": "Q3: Is the cat's sleek fur texture retained?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a finely crafted toy with a smooth surface meant to imitate fur in a simplified manner. Instead of realistic fur texture, the design suggests a minimalistic approach that conveys the idea of fur without fine details. The use of materials emphasizes a smooth textile instead. Given this observation combined with common design choices in character models, the sleek fur texture as originally presented is not retained.",

    "Question": "Q4: Does the cat maintain its upward gaze and posture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cat character displays a forward-facing posture, looking at the viewer, which does not convey a specific upward gaze. As per the elements of the design, the head position suggests engagement with the observer rather than an upward focus. Based on understanding figurines and stylized representations, gaze direction is an important expressive detail, and this differs from the supposed upward gaze in another context. Hence, the upward gaze and posture are not maintained.",
