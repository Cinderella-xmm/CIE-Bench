      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bandage has been transformed into a cartoon-like figurine with a humanoid shape, featuring arms, legs, and a head. The reference to a bandage in Image B is more conceptual, based on its coloration and facial features, rather than preserving its traditional medical shape seen in Image A. Image A shows a standard bandage with a rounded rectangular shape, while Image B presents a chibi-style character design that deviates from this shape.",

      "question": "Is the central adhesive strip still present in the same relative position and size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a cartoon-like bandage with a stitched facial expression, suggesting a playful design rather than a functional medical adhesive strip. Instead of an adhesive strip as seen in Image A, Image B has altered the bandage into a figurine with eyes, stitched elements, and a boxed design for toys. The original design's focus on practical medical use shifts to artistic representation, so the strip's position and size are not comparable to Image A.",

      "question": "Does the bandage retain its visible fabric texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B gives the bandage a highly stylized, cartoonish texture, resembling an animated toy design. While Image A conveys a fabric texture with natural lighting effects on a real bandage, the figurine texture in Image B seems smooth and designed for collectible aesthetics rather than a typical fabric appearance.",

      "question": "Are the bandage's overall proportions consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A depicts a standard bandage with realistic proportions used in medical scenarios. In contrast, Image B transforms the bandage into a humanoid toy character, altering its proportions significantly to fit this new design, including elements that resemble limbs and facial features, thus changing the proportions from those seen in a functional bandage.",

      "question": "Is there a shadow cast by the bandage, contributing to its three-dimensional appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bandage is presented as a three-dimensional toy figurine with cartoonish, rounded features. Even though it exhibits shading and the boxed toy may suggest a shadow, the artistic design focuses on a playful visual representation rather than a realistic depiction with shadows. Image A, on the other hand, shows a direct shadow cast by the bandage due to lighting, contributing to its real appearance.",
