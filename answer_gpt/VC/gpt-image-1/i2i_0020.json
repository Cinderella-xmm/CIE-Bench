      "question": "Is the train represented in a red-and-gray color block scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the train is depicted using bold and simplified color blocks. The dominant colors on the train are red and gray, which create a stylized, graphical representation. By combining visual understanding with world knowledge of color schemes, it's evident that the color block scheme involves red and gray as the primary colors.",

      "question": "Is the sign circular with the text \"STOP\" clearly displayed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sign is not circular but rather a stylized form resembling a stop sign, which is typically octagonal. The sign displays the text 'STOP' prominently within this octagonal shape. Common knowledge about traffic signs and their visual appearance helps in identifying the clear display of 'STOP' on the sign.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the train positioned parallel to the tracks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual representation in Image B shows the train aligned in a manner consistent with typical railway systems, where the train runs parallel to the tracks. The stylized design uses parallel lines to indicate tracks beneath the train, reinforcing the concept that the train is expected to be parallel.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features outlines of mountains in the background, depicted in a green color scheme. This use of color and simplified shapes suggests natural mountain scenery, typically associated with rolling hills or mountainous areas visible in real-world settings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are highly stylized, simplified lines beneath the train representing tracks. This minimalistic depiction is common in graphic representations to convey the presence of railway tracks.",
