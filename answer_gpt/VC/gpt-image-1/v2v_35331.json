    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the background composed of green grass with visible blades and natural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is clearly identifiable as green grass. The blades are distinct, with varying lengths and shades that are typical characteristics of grass. The natural texture of grass, with its uneven and fibrous appearance, is visible, indicating a realistic portrayal.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there soft shadows cast by the subject(s) onto the grass, consistent with natural outdoor lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows soft shadows on the grass, particularly around the feet of the fused form. These shadows are consistent with natural outdoor lighting, which generally results in diffused and soft shadow lines when the light source is diffuse, like on a cloudy day.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the fused form positioned directly on the grass surface, with contact points visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feet of the fused form appear to make contact with the grass surface, suggesting that the form is positioned directly on the grass. The grass blades are pushed down slightly around the contact area, which is consistent with objects resting on grass.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the grass predominantly green with natural variations in shade and tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grass in Image B displays a predominant green color with variations in shades, which is typical in natural settings due to differences in lighting and grass health. The texture aids in creating these tonal variations, offering a realistic setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the fused form incorporate both yellow and tan hues, reflecting the original banana and dog colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a combination of banana and dog elements, where the form has a yellow hue for the body, resembling a banana, and tan hues reflecting the dog's fur color. These color integrations create a coherent representation of both original elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are individual blades of grass visible in the foreground and midground, contributing to a textured surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Individual grass blades are clearly visible in Image B, contributing to the texture and realism of the grass surface. The variation in orientation and height of the blades provides a natural, textured look typical of grass fields.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
