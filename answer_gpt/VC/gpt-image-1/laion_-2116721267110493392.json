        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the second boy is illustrated with a smooth, bald head, consistent with a cartoon representation. The use of bright, solid colors and simple shapes typical in cartoons emphasizes this feature, which is why he is depicted as bald.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the first boy is portrayed without any glasses. Cartoon characters usually have exaggerated, clear features, and no spectacles are depicted on him, which confirms that he is not wearing black-framed glasses.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bald boy is illustrated holding a tablet with both hands. The tablet is depicted as upright, with its screen visible. The cartoon style emphasizes clear, simple actions and postures, which is why this stance is conveyed plainly.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B does not depict the boy with glasses and just shows his open exuberant posture without any sign of leaning forward towards the tablet, he isn't depicted as leaning toward the tablet. Instead, he seems to be sitting upright and engaged in the activity alongside his friend.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, where cartoonish styles present clear visuals and omit unnecessary details, no backpack is illustrated. The focus is kept on the boys, their expressions, and interaction, without depicting extra elements such as a backpack.",
