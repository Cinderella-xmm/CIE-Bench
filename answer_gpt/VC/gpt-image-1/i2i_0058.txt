    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited subject (anthropomorphic bull) maintain the rightward walking posture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the anthropomorphic bull is depicted standing with both legs spread apart, not exhibiting any visible movement. The posture indicates that the bull is stationary rather than walking to the right. The armor and cape also suggest a rightward stance but not necessarily walking, as the tail is swinging rather than trailing in motion.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are the riders still positioned directly atop the anthropomorphic bull, maintaining their original relative height from the ground?",
