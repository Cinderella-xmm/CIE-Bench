        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine of the woman is positioned with her body facing slightly towards the viewer, and her left arm rests on the column, suggesting a three-quarter pose. However, the position of the head is blurred but seems to face forward rather than turned toward the viewer directly. Thus, considering body positioning, she is not fully facing the viewer.",
