        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible bike frame as the image instead shows a mobile device screen with what appears to be a user interface. This suggests that the image content has been entirely replaced, indicating that there is no red bike frame in sight in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the bike still have a rear rack attached to it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a smartphone interface rather than a bike, meaning there are no visible components of a bike, such as a rear rack. Therefore, based on the visual content of Image B, the bike does not have a rear rack visible.",

      "question": "Is the bike still leaning against a wooden log?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B shows a smartphone screen and not an outdoor scene with a bike leaning against a log, the bike is not present, and therefore it is not leaning against a wooden log in Image B.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a digital display from a smartphone or another device, which does not include natural elements such as grass or leaves. The foreground contains only digital interface components, devoid of any natural landscape.",
