        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the calendar appears to be stacked, with the top page showing October 12 marked for a 'Wedding.' The presence of this handwritten note indicates that such annotations are still present. World knowledge suggests that events like weddings are typically noted on calendars to mark significant dates. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that these annotations are still present.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the top page of a stack of calendar sheets with clear text, numbers, and the 'Wedding' note marked in red. The date numbers and handwritten note are both legible, indicating that the text remains clear vis-Ã -vis normal calendar readability standards. Hence, it can be concluded that the text is still legible and clear.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a structured grid format with dates organized in rows and columns, consistent with the typical design of a calendar. Compared to the original image, the grid structure seems unchanged; it maintains its standard alignment and layout. Therefore, the grid structure seems to remain intact.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top calendar sheet clearly displays the month 'October' at the top of the page. Correct placement of month labels is typical for calendar formatting, signaling that the month label is visible and correctly placed. Therefore, we can infer that month labels such as 'January,' 'April,' and 'October' are still visible and correctly placed.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the date numbers, including '12,' which is circled and highlighted on the October calendar sheet. The arrangement in rows and columns aligns with usual calendar design standards, suggesting that date numbers are in their correct positions. Therefore, image B confirms that the date numbers are present and correctly positioned.",
