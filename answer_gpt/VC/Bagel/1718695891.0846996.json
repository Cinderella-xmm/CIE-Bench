      "question": "Is the dress shown with clearly defined, flowing fabric folds that cascade from the shoulder down to the floor and pool on the windowsill?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the medium is a stylized enamel pin, which simplifies and abstracts visual elements. The woman's dress is depicted in a streamlined, simplified manner without intricate details like fabric folds cascading and pooling, which are characteristic of realistic depictions. Instead, it presents smooth lines typical of the enamel art style.",

      "question": "Are the window frame and surrounding border decorated with organic, swirling floral patterns and gentle arches characteristic of Art Nouveau design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, being conceptualized as an enamel pin, does not depict detailed window frames or floral patterns with swirling designs. The image focuses on a central female figure with a background hinting at floral motifs but lacks the detailed Art Nouveau architectural elements and patterns found in traditional imagery.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no such detailed depiction of additional objects like a vase with flowers. The focus is primarily on the simplified representation of the woman and some abstract floral background, common in artistic graphic depictions such as pins.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the existing color palette is primarily pastel, featuring soft green and cream tones, with gold outlines, creating a harmonious and stylized representation. This aligns with the enamel style design where such colors are prevalent to emphasize the figure and intricate details.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the stylistic nature of the enamel pin design, the woman is shown with a simplified and erect posture. There is no clear indication of a forward-leaning or bowing posture that suggests a look towards the left side.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, being a simplified, artistic depiction of a woman on an enamel pin, does not display intricate background details such as a stained-glass window or ghostly figures. Instead, it presents a stylized figure on a patterned background typical of an enamel design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
