      "question": "Are the gorilla’s eyes golden-yellow in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla's eyes are visually depicted as blue in color. The packaging and emphasis on the blue color make the gorilla’s eyes clearly non-golden-yellow. By associating the commonly portrayed colors used for gorilla eyes in designs and packaging, we conclude that blue is portrayed and not golden-yellow.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a prominent silver-colored crest on the top of the gorilla’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla’s head shows a notable area of lighter coloration, which is often depicted as silver in gorillas, specifically known as the silverback feature in adult male gorillas. This is reasonable due to the pattern observed in silverback gorillas, characterized by such patches.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bananas are shown as multiple yellow fruits connected to a single central stem, and their orientation is characteristic of bananas curving outward from a common stem, which aligns with standard visual representations of banana bunches.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla is portrayed with dense, dark fur that displays notable texture and depth, along with variations in shading, contributing to its realistic depiction. This aligns with stereotypical representations of gorilla fur.",
