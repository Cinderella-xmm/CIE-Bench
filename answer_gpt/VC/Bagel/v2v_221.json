      "question": "Is the large black patch on the left shoulder of the cow present and clearly defined?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cow is stylized and cartoonish. It features black patches, but due to its stylized design, the patches are more simplified and not as detailed as in a realistic depiction. The left shoulder area does have a black patch, though its shape is simpler than in real life. Therefore, based on this description, a black patch exists on the left shoulder, fulfilling the criteria of this question.",

      "question": "Is there a continuous white stripe running down the center of the cow’s face from the forehead to the snout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cartoon cow with a white stripe down the center of its face, extending from the forehead to the top of the snout. This is a common characteristic of Holstein cows, which are typically used for representation in cartoons, but this stripe does not extend down to the snout in the same continuous manner as seen in realistic cows.",

      "question": "Are the cow’s horns curved upward and outward, with a light base and dark tips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horns on the cartoon cow curve outward and slightly upward, with the horns having a distinct two-tone color: lighter at the base and darker at the tips. This stylized depiction reflects the natural appearance of a cow’s horns but with simplified and exaggerated features typical of cartoon styles.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the television set depicted in cartoon form does have a speaker grille on the right side and what appear to be multiple knobs at the bottom, consistent with how older televisions are often caricaturized.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoon cow in Image B has its front hooves placed atop the television, whimsically suggesting that it is playfully leaning over the set. This arrangement is clear in the altered, playful depiction of the cow.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features cartoonish elements similar to those in Image A, with a grassy field and a sky dotted with stylized clouds. The colors are vibrant and exaggerated, typical of animated or cartoon scenes. Despite being simplified, the key elements such as grass and clouds are present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the cow's nose is distinctly cartoonish and has an orange-ish color, typical of stylized animal design, with a smiling mouth rather than detailed nostrils as seen in realistic depictions. Despite the pinkish facial features, the nostrils are not visible.",
