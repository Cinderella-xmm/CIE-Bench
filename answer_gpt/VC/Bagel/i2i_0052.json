      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject matter is not related to a realistic representation of sheep. Instead, it's a cartoon or chibi-style illustration of two characters with tennis rackets, hand-drawn in a simple and stylized manner. Thus, there is no depiction of sheep or their wool texture in Image B.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an illustration of two cartoon characters with tennis rackets.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a simple outline of a tennis court and not a grassy field. The illustration is entirely unrelated to a naturalistic setting. Therefore, the grassy field and distribution of sheep are not present in Image B.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B does not represent any natural outdoor scenery but rather a simple depiction of a tennis court within a cartoonish style. Therefore, there is no tree line or field present in this image.",
