    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the light blue botanical pattern (leaf and vine motifs) present on the bedding in the LEGO version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bedding is made of LEGO bricks, and the surface texture of LEGO bricks does not allow for detailed patterns such as botanical motifs seen in textiles. Thus, the light blue blocks serve as the blanket but without additional detailing like a botanical pattern.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bedding and bed frame rendered in white with light blue accents in the LEGO version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a LEGO bed where the bed frame is primarily beige, resembling off-white. The blanket is composed of light blue bricks, which serves as accents. Therefore, it can be interpreted that the bed frame and bedding follow a white with light blue accents theme.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "question": "Are there exactly two pillows stacked vertically on the left side of the bed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a LEGO representation where only one pillow is present, made with stacked LEGO bricks. The design does not include additional pillows visible on the bed.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the blanket folded and positioned on the right half of the bed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the blanket made of light blue LEGO bricks covering the top of the bed rather than folded on the side. Thus, it is positioned more as a full coverage rather than folded on one side.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a simple grey background similar to Image A, without any additional textures or elements beyond the LEGO bed itself.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on the LEGO bed, and there is no dark brown rectangular object visible in any part of the image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bed is positioned horizontally and occupies the central part of the image frame, just as the bed in Image A.",
