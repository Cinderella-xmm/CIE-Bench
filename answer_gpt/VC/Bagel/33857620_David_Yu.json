      "question": "Is the white-framed window visible on the front face of the transformed structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a large, dome-shaped, glowing crystalline structure resembling a creature with legs, making it different from a conventional building like the chalet in Image A. Since the structure in Image B does not resemble a building with a discernible front face or windows, it lacks the specific architectural details like a white-framed window that were present on the chalet in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the small red structure located to the left of the main chalet still present in the transformed scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, featuring an imaginative and otherworldly structure, does not maintain the small red structure located next to the chalet from Image A. The scene in Image B appears more focused on the central creature-like formation, leaving no traces of previously existing smaller maintenance structures as seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the waterway flow from the bottom-right corner toward the center-left of the image, maintaining its original course?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The waterway in Image B retains the same path as in Image A, flowing from the bottom-right corner toward the center-left of the image. This continuity suggests that while the central structure was altered, the natural landscape and water flow were preserved.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the large patch of snow located directly in front of the chalet still visible and positioned in the same place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the large patch of snow, which was visible in front of the chalet in Image A, remains unchanged and visible in the same position. The presence of snow in the same context reinforces the idea that the terrain and snowy patches were preserved despite changes to the structure.",
      "weight": 2,

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are moss-covered rocks visible along the edges of the stream in the transformed scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the stream continue to feature moss-covered rocks similar to those in Image A. These elements contribute to the natural texture of the environment and remain consistent between the two images.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the transformed structure located in the mid-ground, slightly to the right of the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformed structure in Image B is situated in the mid-ground of the scene and is slightly to the right of the center, similar to the positioning of the chalet in Image A. This placement maintains the visual balance of the landscape.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the mountain peaks visible in the background, with snow patches and mist covering their upper portions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the mountain peaks are visible in the background, featuring snow patches and mist covering their upper portions. This atmospheric condition remains consistent, adding depth and context to the location in both images.",
