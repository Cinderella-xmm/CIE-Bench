      "question": "Is the display of the device rectangular with rounded corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a dragon with visually intricate, organic shapes forming its head and body, unlike any man-made device with geometric shapes like rectangles or squares. The dragon's design is mythical and artistic, commonly seen in fantasy art, thus not conforming to any standard device shapes such as rectangular with rounded corners. By using common objects and device design knowledge, this dragon does not have a rectangular display.",

      "question": "Is the digital crown positioned on the right side of the watch case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no presence of a watch case or any crown, digital or mechanical. The image depicts a dragon, which naturally does not include device elements such as a digital crown found on smartwatches with identifiable right or left orientations. The object's structure and design completely deviate from having any functional device parts like a digital crown.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a small button located below the digital crown on the right side of the case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a stylized dragon, which lacks any components resembling a watch case or digital crown and buttons. Since no element in the image constitutes a structured, functional section like that of a smartwatch, there cannot be a button located below a nonexistent digital crown.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the ends of the band attached to the left and right sides of the watch case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dragon in Image B does not feature any watch band or case. Its detailed fantasy design consists of scales and a segmented body structure, unrelated to a band attaching to a watch case. A dragon's depiction doesn't contain components like a watch band attaching at distinct sides.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the screen facing directly forward, perpendicular to the wrist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no screen in Image B, as the image portrays a dragon rather than any device with a screen, which would typically have a direct forward-facing orientation on the wrist if it were a watch. Since mythical creatures like dragons don't possess screens, this question does not apply.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the watch case have a slim, compact profile with minimal depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B has the protruding and detailed features of a fantasy dragon, distinct from a watch case known for its compact, slim design. The dragon's features are intricate and 3-dimensional, implying a more substantial depth compared to minimal device depth.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there multiple adjustment holes along the length of the band?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B doesn't contain a wearable device with a band, hence it lacks any feature like adjustment holes typical to watch bands. The dragon and its artistic portrayal do not incorporate such utilitarian elements as those found in an adjustable wristband.",
