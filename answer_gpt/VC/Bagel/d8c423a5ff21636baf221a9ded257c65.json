      "question": "Are two stone columns visible on the left and right sides of the background, framing the landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no stone columns framing the landscape in the background. Instead, it is a uniform, unfocused backdrop typical of a small figurine or a crafted doll. This absence of columns differentiates Image B from a traditional painting setting which might include architectural elements.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands of the figurine are positioned in a way that they are supporting a small, cartoon-style animal, most likely a lamb, suggesting that she is interacting with it. This is consistent with the pose of nurturing or holding an animal in a lap.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B does not display a necklace with a rectangular pendant. This absence suggests a more simplified and stylized representation as opposed to a detailed painted portrait which might have such features.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

    },
