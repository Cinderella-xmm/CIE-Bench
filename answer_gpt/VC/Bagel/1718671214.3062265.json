      "question": "Is the metallic mask with horn-like protrusions at the temples present and retaining its original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), there is no evidence of a metallic mask with horn-like protrusions visible in the artwork. The style appears to be more cartoonish than metallic. World knowledge suggests that a cartoon drawing would not typically depict a textured, metallic surface with fine details such as horn-like protrusions without explicit, clear visuals indicating so.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red lips and visible lower face (including chin and jawline) clearly present and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) does not show red lips or a detailed lower face due to the face being intentionally obscured or stylistically simplified in cartoonish form. This matches expectations for cartoon styles where details like red lips might not be present unless explicitly detailed.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the black hair styled in an updo with floral branches positioned symmetrically on both sides of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the figure appears to have hair styled in a way suggesting an updo. Symmetrically positioned floral branches are evident on both sides of the head. This aligns with common chibi or cartoon-style depictions that simplify complex hairstyles into recognizable forms.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are cherry blossom branches visibly integrated into the hair on both sides of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the illustration clearly depicts several cherry blossom branches integrated on both sides of the head, with exaggerated and stylized flowers that suggest cherry blossoms in a cartoonish manner. This reflects common artistic styles that emphasize symmetry and simplicity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the subjectâ€™s facial skin tone fair and uniformly lit, matching the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) does not provide detail on facial skin tone due to the style and obscured face. A cartoon form will usually not replicate realistic tonal variations as seen in original realistic images, but employ flat colors suitable for stylized representation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the subject facing directly forward with a symmetrical pose and centered composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the subject appears to be facing forward with a centered composition. This is typical in cartoon or stylized figures that utilize symmetry to create visually balanced imagery.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the mask retain a textured, metallic surface appearance rather than becoming smooth or cartoonish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), there is no visible mask with a textured, metallic surface. The artwork is cartoonish, which inherently implies a lack of detailed texturing, favoring smoothness typical of stylized art forms.",
