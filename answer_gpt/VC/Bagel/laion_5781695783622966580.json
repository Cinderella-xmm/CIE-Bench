      "question": "Is the hat still a wide-brimmed bucket hat with a broad, outward-facing brim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat is illustrated with a substantial brim that extends outward, indicating a wide-brimmed design. The decorative and stylized nature of the drawing further emphasizes the hat's broad and outward-reaching brim. Commonly, bucket hats have soft, downward-sloping brims, but here the brim leans more towards a fashion-orientated stylized design indicative of being wide-brimmed.",

      "question": "Are the eyes, nose, and mouth in their original positions and shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a highly stylized illustration where the facial features are obscured by a blur effect. The depiction does not attempt to represent realistic human features in traditional positions and shapes. Instead, the illustration comprises abstract swirls and thick lines, with no discernable eyes, nose, or mouth. In such art, the focus is more on color and pattern rather than anatomical accuracy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the hair retain its original light brown color and wavy texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'hair' is represented through abstract lines and colors primarily incorporating turquoise, yellow, and black. The artistic representation does not maintain the original light brown color nor the wavy texture. The image is focused more on artistic expression, eschewing realistic hair portrayal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the visible portion of the clothing a white sleeveless top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict clothing in a realistic manner. Instead, the lower region of the image which might correspond to clothing is part of a contiguous abstract design that uses solid colors and patterns. The specific white sleeveless top as seen in Image A is not present in this reimagined stylized form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background a solid white with no additional elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B appears to be a solid white without any distinct elements or distractions present. This maintains consistency with the idea of showcasing the main graphical subject without additional background complexity.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the hat have a rounded crown with consistent height relative to the brim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hat in Image B appears stylized with a crown that has a rounded general shape, matching traditional bucket hat designs. However, due to the artistic liberties taken with line and shape, the exact proportional consistency relative to a real-world item, like in Image A, cannot be definitively ascertained in terms of strict realism.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the lighting even and bright across the face and hat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, lighting doesn't apply conventionally, as it is an abstract illustration. The image consists of solid colors and does not employ realistic lighting effects or shading seen in photographic imagery. Therefore, it's not possible to describe the lighting in terms traditionally applied to physical objects.",
