    "Question": "Q1: Is the text 'STORY PAGES' present in uppercase serif font above the book?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the main visual focus is a glass dome containing a miniature scene. The scene inside the dome includes an open book with glowing pages, but there is no text visible above the book within the globe. Therefore, the text 'STORY PAGES' in uppercase serif font is not present above the book in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the book have a visible spine and two cover edges forming an open structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the book inside the glass dome is presented as an open book, but its spine and cover edges are not distinctly visible due to the miniature and artistic representation, creating more of a stylized appearance than a clearly structural one. As a result, distinct features like a visible spine and cover edges are not discernible.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there multiple curved horizontal lines on both left and right sides of the book representing stacked pages?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the open book within the dome appears to have a minimalistic depiction of pages with a glow rather than detailed curved horizontal lines. The focus is on the illuminating effect rather than emphasizing the depiction of stacked pages with lines. Therefore, multiple curved horizontal lines are not clearly depicted.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the book centered horizontally and vertically beneath the text 'STORY PAGES'?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a glass snow globe with an open book inside it. There is no visible text, particularly 'STORY PAGES', and therefore no concept of the book being centered beneath such text within this image scenario. The scene is focused on the book being centered within the globe, not beneath any exterior text.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the book and text rendered in dark navy blue on a light beige background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the book inside the snow globe is represented with a glow and appears to have a color more fitting to a natural book tone with gold-like illumination rather than dark navy blue. The surrounding background of the scene appears to be a warm indoor setting with a lamp and shelves, unlike a consistent light beige background. There is also no visible text in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
