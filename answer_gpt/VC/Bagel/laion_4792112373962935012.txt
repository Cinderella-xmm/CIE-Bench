    "Question": "Q3: Is the rim of the glass coated with a speckled mixture of white and red granules?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the rim of the glass is shown covered with what appears to be granules that are colored in pink.

    "Question": "Q5: Is the glass placed on a dark blue surface?",
    "explanation": "In the context of Image B, the background does not support the idea of a dark blue surface.

Therefore, the glass is not placed on a dark blue surface but rather appears amidst a colorful party-themed backdrop.",
