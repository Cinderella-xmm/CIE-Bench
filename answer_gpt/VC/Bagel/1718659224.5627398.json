      "question": "Is the central tower of the fortress composed of multiple stacked, progressively smaller rectangular tiers forming a stepped pyramid shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cookie castle with a central tower-like structure. However, it doesn't form a stepped pyramid shape. Instead, it resembles a simplified castle design with icing peaks and decorations meant to emulate turrets. The tiers are not progressively smaller rectangles; they are uniform and decorative. Hence, based on the visual cues and knowing how gingerbread castles are crafted, the answer is No.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there regular, alternating tooth-like projections (crenellations) along the upper edges of the fortress walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gingerbread castle features scalloped and peaked edges along the tops of its walls. These designs imitate crenellations common in actual fortress architecture. Based on typical cookie designs and recognizing these as representations of crenellations due to their alternating peaked form, the answer is Yes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a prominent arched opening located at the lower front section of the fortress, serving as a main entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gingerbread castle in Image B contains a clear, arched opening at the forefront that represents a typical entrance in a simplified architectural form. The visually explicit feature of the arch suggests it is intended as an entrance, informed by common gingerbread design mimicking castle architecture, the answer is Yes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the waterfall originate from a gap in the cliff face directly beneath the fortress wall and cascade downward into the river below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows icing that appears to flow from within the castle wall structure itself. However, it is part of the creative decoration of the cookie and not from a 'gap' as would be seen in an actual cliff setting. Since there isn't a natural cliff formation from which the waterfall cascades, the answer is No.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the fortress situated on a raised cliff overlooking a river that flows through a narrow canyon below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a gingerbread representation and does not include a visual environment like a raised cliff or canyon. It rests flat on a plate, and the design suggests only a fantasy castle without real geographical features such as a cliff or canyon. Thus, based on these visual and common context considerations, the answer is No.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are clusters of green shrubs and trees visible along the canyon walls and riverbanks surrounding the fortress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gingerbread scene in Image B includes green icing decorations that represent shrubs and trees, but these are placed alongside the cookie castle on the plate, not in a 'canyon' or 'riverbank' setting. Understanding the context of decorative gingerbread designs, these are merely representative elements not situated within a canyon or bank environment as in the query. Therefore, the answer is No.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gingerbread castle stands on a flat, circular base that represents a larger cookie. The castle itself exhibits vertical walls and turret-like features, mimicking corner towers visually, but the base is not solidly rectangular in geometry, typical in gingerbread designs for aesthetic display. In this context, the answer is No.",
