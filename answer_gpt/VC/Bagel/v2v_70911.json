      "question": "Is the AXE logo still visible on the container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the container's label design remains in view with the AXE logo clearly visible. Analyzing Image B independently shows that the logo is prominently positioned on the left side of the label, and world knowledge about branding implies that such logos are often made to be eye-catching and easily recognizable.",

      "question": "Does the container retain its cylindrical shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the container's shape appears to be altered, with a conspicuous break or explosion at the top, implying structural deformation. By independently observing Image B, the typical cylindrical form is compromised due to an artistic effect that gives it an abstract look, suggesting that it no longer holds its original shape. Cylindrical containers usually have smooth, consistent surfaces which are not present in this edited image.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the fiery red and energetic pink hues from the label's explosive design still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon analysis of the color scheme, the red and pink hues are prominently discernible on the label in a graphic design pattern. The continued presence of these colors indicates their integral role in the design, seen from the visible segments displaying angular graphics typical of the described hues.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the net weight text (\"NET WT 2.64 OZ (75g)\") still visible on the label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the lower section of the label where the net weight usually appears seems obscured or altered, most likely due to the graphical effects applied that emulate an explosion. The specificity of text, like the net weight, is not visible, suggesting a deviation from precise labeling details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the container depicted as mostly intact, with only a crack allowing the nebula to be seen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a significant alteration showing an explosion effect rather than a simple crack. The vibrant nebular imagery breaks through multiple areas, suggesting more than minor damage. A 'mostly intact' state would imply minimal breakage, while Image B portrays extensive modifications beyond a mere crack.",
