      "question": "Is the classical archway with ornate carvings present and maintaining its original shape and position in the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no classical archways or ornate carvings visible. The objects present in the image include a plush toy pigeon and cookie structures resembling buildings as opposed to an architectural framework. Based on this observation and understanding of classical archways, the edited image does not feature any archway structure similar to Image A.",

      "question": "Is the Corinthian column capital with acanthus leaf detailing visible and correctly positioned beneath the spherical perch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is completely different with no Corinthian columns or capitals present. Instead, it features objects such as toy pigeons and cookie houses. There is no column capital with detailing beneath any spherical perch, unlike Image A, where such elements are present in the architectural scene.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the perch located directly on top of the Corinthian column capital, maintaining its original vertical alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting has entirely changed, and there is no perch or column capital visible as it is a scene with toys and cookies, not an architectural one. Hence, the original vertical alignment with the column capital does not exist in this image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the tall fluted column on the left and the distant spired buildings visible in their original positions and silhouettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature any tall fluted columns or distant spired buildings typical of the skyline visible in Image A. Instead, the edited image displays several cookie-shaped buildings which do not match the original architecture style or positions. Hence, those original elements are not visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sky depicted as bright blue with scattered white cumulus clouds, matching the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a plain neutral color without any depiction of a sky or cumulus clouds. This is starkly different from Image A, which features a vivid blue sky with white clouds and is a hallmark of the original image's ambiance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no floral or scroll carvings visible. These carvings are part of the architectural elements, specifically the arch and column in Image A, but the edited image does not include any similar structures.",

      "question": "Is the pigeon oriented sideways with its head turned slightly toward the viewer, maintaining its original posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a plush pigeon toy, which is not oriented sideways nor has its head turned slightly toward the viewer as in Image A. The toy maintains a frontal posture with simplistic features. Therefore, the sideward orientation and posture seen in Image A's real pigeon depiction are absent in Image B.",
