      "question": "Are the pointed Gothic arches clearly visible within the stone towers of the bridge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone towers of the bridge are obstructed by a large, towering robot-like figure and the added skyscrapers in the background. The stone towers are no longer the main focus, and the Gothic arches are not clearly visible due to these obstructions. Thus, even though the arches are part of the original bridge structure, they are not clearly visible in this edited image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the American flag still present on top of the left tower of the bridge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the left tower that might have had a flag is partially visible, but there is no clear depiction of the American flag in this edited image. The visibility and position of the elements on top of this tower are not clearly depicted due to the large robot and the added skyscrapers.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the bridge tower retain its original light gray sandstone texture with visible block patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the modifications in Image B, the bridge tower maintains its original structural appearance with a light gray sandstone texture and visible block patterns. The visual cues support the presence of these textures just as in Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the Freedom Tower positioned behind and slightly to the right of the bridgeâ€™s central axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Freedom Tower is still visible and positioned behind and slightly to the right of the central axis of the bridge, similar to its position in Image A. This indicates that the structural edits did not alter its position relative to the bridge.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a reflective surface of water directly beneath the bridge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the bridge and the ground below is obstructed by a large robot, and thus the reflective surface of water that appeared in Image A is not visible in the edited version. The visual changes suggest that water reflections are not present.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the clouds in the sky distributed in a partly cloudy pattern with soft blue and white tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a sky with a similar distribution of clouds as in Image A. The appearance of partly cloudy skies with soft blue and white tones remains consistent despite the edits made to the skyline and addition of elements like the large robot.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the surrounding skyscrapers retain visible grid patterns of windows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the newly added skyscrapers and the large robot obscure the original buildings that might have had grid patterns of windows. The visual focus is on the robot and other larger structures, and no clear grid patterns are visible in the edited image.",
