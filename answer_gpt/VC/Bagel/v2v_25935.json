      "question": "Is the man depicted walking away from the viewer along the street?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Lego figure, which represents a man, has his back facing the viewer and is positioned on a street, indicating he is walking away. The typical visual cue of someone walking away includes their backside facing the observer, which is evident here. The street setting further supports this conclusion.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Lego figure holds a red piece resembling a briefcase in his right hand, similar to the original image where a man holds a brown briefcase. This red object is positioned in the figure's right hand, indicating it is a briefcase.",

      "question": "Is the man wearing a denim jacket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Lego figure is dressed in blue pieces that visually mimic the color pattern and shape similar to a denim jacket, as seen in the man in Image A. However, the nature of LEGO pieces reflecting simple representation suggests an abstraction rather than detailed attire like denim jackets.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the Lego street's appearance as a composed of grey textured pieces that simulate the look of cobblestones similar to those in Image A, and buildings are clearly visible on both sides of the street. These elements match the elements in Image A with abstraction form due to the LEGO interpretation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings on either side of the LEGO street maintain their structural presence with shapes suggesting windows and doors, similar to Image A's depiction of buildings along a street. The essential shapes and structures are consistent across both images, maintaining the presence of buildings.",
