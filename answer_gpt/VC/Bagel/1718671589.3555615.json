      "question": "Is the central dome present and positioned directly above the main structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) depicts a gingerbread house styled like a cathedral, with a dome positioned directly above its main structure. It is decorated with white icing, which outlines the dome and adds texture and detail. This visual cue, combined with common architectural knowledge, indicates that the dome is centrally located above the main square base of the gingerbread structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a golden star located at the very top of the dome’s spire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the dome's spire does not have a golden star. The spire is made of brown gingerbread itself with decorations consistent with the rest of the edible structure. Analyzing these visual cues, it is evident that there is no golden or metallic element atop the dome.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the windows arranged in a symmetrical grid pattern across the building’s front face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The windows on the edited image (Image B) are designed with decorative icing, featuring a simplified pattern rather than a detailed grid. They are visually symmetrical but do not form a complex or intricate grid that might be observed in traditional architectural design. Therefore, based on visual cues of the icing decoration, they do not form a grid pattern.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a row of vertical columns forming a portico at the ground level of the building’s front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no vertical columns forming a portico at the ground level of the gingerbread structure. Instead, the front facade is decorated with white icing that outlines windows and doors, but does not depict any columns that would suggest a portico formation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there two large trees with golden-yellow foliage positioned symmetrically on both sides of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) features two trees crafted from gingerbread, decorated with white icing to resemble leaves. Although they are positioned on both sides, their design is similar but not identical to the concept of large trees with golden-yellow foliage. Since they are made of gingerbread and not actual foliage, the attribute of 'golden-yellow foliage' does not apply here.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a straight paved road running in front of the building, parallel to its base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the edited image (Image B), the base of the gingerbread structure is set on what appears to be a marble-like surface, but there is no visible paved road running parallel to the structure. The surface seems more decorative and is indicative of a presentation base rather than a functional road.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the building have a square base with rounded corners on the upper levels before transitioning into the dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gingerbread structure does have a square base, and its upper levels smoothly transition into a dome without distinct rounded corners as seen in classic building structures. The decorative icing provides rounded embellishments, but the transition into the dome is prominent without traditional upper rounded architectural features.",
