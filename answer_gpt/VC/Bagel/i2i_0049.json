        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, there is a zebra against a green background and no visible sign with the word 'START' above any figure present. Considering Image A, the skier is present with a start banner visible above them. Since this feature is entirely absent in Image B, the large red text 'START' is not visible or unchanged in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a zebra facing right against a plain green background, devoid of any skier or skiing gear. Meanwhile, Image A displays a skier dressed in skiing gear holding ski poles. Due to the complete alteration in the subject between the images, the skier does not hold poles nor is dressed in skiing gear in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, only a zebra is present, with no visible skier or bib displaying any numbers. Image A has a skier wearing a bib with the number '66'. As the skier is absent in the edited image, the bib is not visible or unchanged.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The context of Image B shows a minimalist green background without any indication of snow or ski tracks. In contrast, Image A has a snowy landscape with ski tracks under the skier. This noticeable absence of a snowy ground in Image B indicates that the snowy setting is not present in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skier in Image A is in a forward-leaning posture, suggesting race readiness. However, in Image B, there is no skier present, only a standing zebra. Thus, there is no indication of a skier or any posture resembling race readiness in the edited image.",
