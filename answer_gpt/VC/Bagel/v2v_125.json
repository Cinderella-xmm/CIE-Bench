        "** Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style characters are dressed in a consistent outfit resembling a beige or tan shirt. The color matches the shirt seen in the original photo (Image A), indicating consistency. World knowledge suggests that this color is often described as beige. This visual evidence and common understanding support identifying the shirt color as beige.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse shown in the chibi stickers has a brown coat. This assessment is based on the horse's primary body and face color in the edited image, appearing similar to the typical shades of brown in horse coats. Comparing it to Image A, where the horse indeed has a brown coat, confirms this observation since both images represent a similar depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a small chibi illustration of the horse that retains the black bridle as part of its design. This consistency is noted when comparing with Image A, where the horse also features a black bridle. The visual cue of the dark strap across certain areas of the horse's face suggests the presence of a bridle in both versions.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style illustrations show the rider on horseback or near the horse but do not distinctly depict the character holding reins. The artistic style simplifies the details, focusing more on the character expressions and poses. In contrast, Image A clearly shows the person holding the reins, but this detail is less explicit in the playful style of Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a collection of chibi-stickers featuring cartoonish characters and does not provide a detailed background to clearly identify earthy tones or outdoor settings. However, typical backgrounds for equestrian-themed chibi illustrations might imply such contexts, but we cannot visually confirm this in Image B. Unlike Image A, where such elements are apparent, Image B focuses solely on the characters.",
