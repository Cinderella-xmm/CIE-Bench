    "Question": "Q1: Is the fireplace still centrally located on the wall?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the architectural feature resembling a fireplace, although blurred, appears to be centrally positioned within the alcove or recess in the wall. The visual cues of symmetry with the surrounding stone structure support this conclusion. Therefore, the fireplace is still centrally located.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there still wall-mounted light fixtures visible?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible wall-mounted light fixtures. The area above the blurred section and around the walls shows architectural features such as stone arches and stone block textures, but no light fixtures are evident.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there still decorative items placed above the fireplace?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, due to the blur applied above the fireplace area, it is not possible to identify any decorative items. The field of view shows stone architecture without smaller decor details.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the armchairs still arranged facing the central fireplace?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the armchairs are positioned directly facing each other across the circular table, aimed towards the central blurred area which suggests a fireplace-like structure. The alignment indicates they are arranged facing the central feature of the room.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the image still maintain a warm color palette?",
    "explanation": "Image B employs a cooler color palette, dominated by shades of blue and gray within the stone textures. The lighting reflects a somewhat subdued, warm highlight due to the fireplace-like feature's glow. However, the strong presence of cooler tones indicates the image does not predominantly maintain a warm color palette.",
    "answer": "No"
