    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the figure shown in profile, facing left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is facing forward, not in profile. The position of the head and body does not align with a side profile typically associated with facing left. Therefore, the figure is not shown in profile.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the right hand grip a long vertical object extending downward from the shoulder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure indeed is holding a long vertical scepter-like staff with the right hand, which stands out prominently, extending downward from the shoulder region. This grip is a classic pose often associated with figures of authority or royalty.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors in the image golden, ochre, and earthy browns, consistent with the original sunset lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is characterized by rich, regal colors, primarily featuring gold, red, and various shades associated with royal attire. Unlike Image A, which has warm, earthy tones from a natural setting, this image uses bold colors to indicate richness and nobility, rather than being consistent with the sunset hues.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the legs positioned slightly apart, with weight distributed evenly, suggesting a stable stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure stands with legs slightly apart, which conveys a sense of balance and readiness, typical for a heroic or authoritative pose. The evenly distributed weight supports a stable and grounded stance.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the left arm relaxed and hanging straight down along the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The left arm in Image B does not hang straight down; instead, it appears to be positioned forward over a gauntlet or ornate glove. This position contrasts a relaxed hanging arm posture, suggesting more engagement or preparedness.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the figure located in the foreground, with open space behind it leading to distant hills or structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is prominently placed in the foreground, with clear scenery in the background, leading to distant hills and castles. This composition is common in portraits to emphasize grandeur and context of the person's status.",
