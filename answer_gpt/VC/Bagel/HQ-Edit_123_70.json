      "question": "Is the bear's body shaped with a distinct hump over the shoulders and a broad, muscular back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear depicted is a cartoon or animated character, and it does not have a distinct hump over the shoulders or a broad, muscular back. Instead, it's designed with anthropomorphic features like glasses and clothing, which are typical of cartoon representations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the salmon have a clearly defined forked tail fin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fish depicted alongside text is stylized and simplified, lacking realistic anatomical details such as a clearly defined forked tail fin. It's more of a cartoon depiction fitting with the overall theme of the image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the bear’s fur rendered with visible texture and layered shading, showing wetness and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bear in Image B is presented in a cartoon style, focusing on simplified shapes and colors with no detailed texture, shading, or effects indicating wetness or fur depth. Its characteristics are primarily designed for anthropomorphic and illustrative appeal rather than realistic rendering.",
      "weight": 2,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the salmon colored with a blue-green back and a silvery-white belly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a fish with cartoonish styling rather than natural coloration. While it might have colors for artistic purposes, the detailed gradation of a blue-green back and silvery-white belly typical of a real salmon is not depicted in the simplified version shown.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible water splashes or ripples around the bear’s lower legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear is set against a cartoon-style background without any detailed features like water splashes or ripples, as the image is focused more on the cartoon atmosphere and content rather than naturalistic details.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the bear have a long, broad snout with visible nostrils and a rounded muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bear in Image B is not designed with realism in mind; it's a cartoon bear characterized primarily by its anthropomorphic features like glasses and a lack of emphasis on realistic facial structure. Therefore, details such as a long, broad snout with nostrils are not evident.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the salmon positioned horizontally in the bear’s mouth, with its head protruding forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no interaction between a bear and salmon in a realistic manner. The fish is depicted separately in a stylized and cartoonish manner rather than being positioned in a bear’s mouth as would be seen in a nature scene. This emphasizes the cartoon context over realism.",
