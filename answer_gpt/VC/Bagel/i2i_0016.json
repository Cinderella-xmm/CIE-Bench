      "question": "Do both players retain identifiable clothing (white shirts and shorts, white tank top with black bottoms) and hairstyles in the chibi version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both players are portrayed in a cartoonish style, known as 'chibi,' which often simplifies features while maintaining identifiable elements. The player on the left wears an outfit with a predominantly white shirt and blue shorts, and a cap, similar to a modern athletic outfit. The player on the right wears a white top with a black skirt and has her hair tied back, resembling a tank top and athletic skirt combination. These elements closely match the outfits seen in their original depiction in an athletic setting, meaning identifiable clothing and hairstyles are retained in a simplified form.",

      "question": "Are both players still holding tennis rackets in the chibi rendition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the chibi version in Image B, both characters are depicted with tennis rackets in their hands. The details of the rackets, such as the strings and the handles, are simplified yet clearly visible, maintaining the key element of them holding tennis equipment, consistent with their original tennis match setting.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the handshake pose still maintained between the two chibi players over the net?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two chibi characters are depicted shaking hands, just as the players are doing in the original Image A. This pose remains consistent, symbolizing sportsmanship and completion of the game or match. The handshake is a key feature of the interaction between the two players, showing they are maintaining the same gesture.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are tennis balls and the net still present in the foreground and middle ground respectively?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi illustration focuses on the characters and does not explicitly depict tennis balls or a net in a detailed or realistic manner in the same way Image A does. The stylization and focus seem to exclude these items, emphasizing the handshake and the sport context without those specific background elements.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the background still depict an outdoor tennis court or at least retain visual hints of it (e.g., court lines, fencing)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a stylized green circle with white lines that resemble tennis court lines, indicative of a tennis court graphic. However, it lacks the detailed realism of an actual outdoor tennis court, such as visible fencing or net posts. This stylization provides a hint of the tennis court environment without recreating the full outdoor setting shown in Image A.",
