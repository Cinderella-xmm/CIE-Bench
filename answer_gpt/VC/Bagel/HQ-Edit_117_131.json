      "question": "Is the squirrel standing upright on its hind legs with its front paws clasped together near the chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel is depicted standing upright, which can be inferred from its positioning and anthropomorphic stance. The way its front paws are positioned implies a clasped setup near the chest, coinciding with such fictional representations. By observing the front posture of animated characters, I can conclude that it is indeed standing upright.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the squirrel have a large, bushy tail that curves upward and outward, extending above the back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel exhibits a prominent tail that is not only large and bushy but also curls upward and somewhat outward. This matches typical stylizations where exaggerated characteristics like large tails are common. The tail's depiction suggests a visual emphasis, which is artistically consistent with cartoonish portrayals.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ears of the squirrel rounded and positioned on top of the head, with a visible pink inner surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The squirrel in Image B has its ears rounded, fitting an animated style. The ears are obviously situated on the top. However, there is no distinct pink inner surface visible, rather the ears blend in with the overall purple color scheme of the character. Recognizing animation conventions, variation exists in colors for stylistic reasons.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the eyes large, round, dark, and located symmetrically on either side of the face, with visible pupils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a squirrel that has oversized, round eyes positioned symmetrically on its face. The eyes have distinct reflections and pupils, following a common trope in animated characters to create expressive and engaging visuals. Such features are generally used to enhance the cuteness or emotional expression of the character?",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the head proportionally smaller than the body, with the tail approximately equal in length to the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a squirrel where the head appears relatively large and significant compared to the typical scale for real creatures. The tail's distinct curl limits accurate length assessment to compare directly with the body; given the creativity in the design and the prominent backpack, dimensional evaluation isn't simple. The squirrel's overall look stresses visuals over proportion accuracy.",
