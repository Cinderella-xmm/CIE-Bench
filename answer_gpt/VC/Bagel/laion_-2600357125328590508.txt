    "Question": "Q1: Is the vertical white \"Under Armour\" logo clearly visible on the outer side of the calf, maintaining its original font, spacing, and orientation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a LEGO sculpture mimics the design of the sock from Image A. The sculpture does not have a clear and visible logo that resembles \"Under Armour\" because the LEGO blocks affect the precision necessary to display the text clearly. Usually, companies use specific fonts and orientation for their logos for brand identity. The irregular surfaces and grid layout of LEGO do not maintain such font and spacing fidelity.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there an orange tag with a black Under Armour logo located at the top edge of the sock cuff?",
    "explanation": "Image B, the LEGO sculpture, depicts an orange piece on top resembling the tag on Image A. However, the Under Armour logo itself, which requires fine details, is not present or visible due to the nature of LEGO pieces. Logos on clothing tags are typically specific in design, something difficult to replicate with blocky LEGO structures.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the stylized \"UA\" logo present on the ankle section of the sock?",
    "explanation": "Without comparing, Image B lacks distinct markings that suggest a stylized \"UA\" logo is present at the ankle section. Locations like ankles often have brand logos for visibility, but the LEGO structure does not depict or include such details that would imply the presence of the logo.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the gray and white geometric patterns on the foot and shin area preserved in their original positions and color scheme?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO sculpture employs colors similar to Image A, including black, white, and gray patterns. However, due to the blocky nature of LEGO, the precise geometric patterns and shapes such as lines or specific arrangement seen in Image A, are neither maintained accurately nor in the same positions.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the gray reinforced sections on the heel and toe maintained in their original shape and location?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the sculpture using colors to mark certain sections notably at the heel and toe areas as seen in the positioning of blocks. However, due to the artistic nature of the sculpture using LEGO blocks, the specific 'reinforced' sections depicted are not in the same shape, and accurate positioning is compromised due to the medium used.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the small text printed vertically along the lower leg of the sock still visible and in its original position?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, LEGO blocks are used creatively to represent the sock design, but do not translate to small printed text on the lower leg, which requires precise detail beyond the capability of LEGO construction blocks. Detailed branding or description is absent.",
    "answer": "No"
