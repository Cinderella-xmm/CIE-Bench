      "question": "Are the cheetahs still depicted in their original seated and standing postures on the earthen mound?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetahs are shown in the same postures as in Image A, where one cheetah is seated in front, and the other is standing behind it on the earthen mound. This indicates that their original postures have been maintained in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the heavy modification with mechanical elements, the earthen mound is still visible beneath the cheetahs, similar to Image A. The base of the mound and the overall structure remain intact.",

      "question": "Do the cheetahs retain their black-ringed tails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetahs' tails are visibly marked with black rings, maintaining one of their distinct features as seen in Image A. This patterning is characteristic of cheetahs, and the edited image preserves this detail.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a highly modified background compared to Image A. Instead of the original savanna landscape, the background is filled with mechanical and steampunk elements, altering the setting entirely. The greenery and natural horizon line are replaced with stylized structures.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the relative positioning of the cheetahs (one seated in front, the other standing behind) maintained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the positioning of the cheetahs is consistent: the seated cheetah is in the front, and the standing cheetah is positioned behind it. This indicates that their relative placement has been maintained in Image B.",
