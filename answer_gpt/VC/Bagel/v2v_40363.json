        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the child is depicted as a simplified cartoon-like graphic made of tiled or mosaic elements. The pose of the child is consistent and similar in both images, with the child reaching out. Based on the visual analysis, the child's position appears similar, and the overall shape of the child is retained despite the stylistic alteration.",

        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the round red balloon appears in the same position relative to the child's extended hand as in the original image, maintaining its shape as a classic round balloon. Therefore, the position and shape of the round red balloon are consistent with the original image.",

        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the heart-shaped balloon is in the same position relative to the child as in the original image and retains its heart shape. Thus, its shape and position have been preserved.",

      "correct_answer": "yes",
