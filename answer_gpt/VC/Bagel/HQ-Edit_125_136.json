      "question": "Is the American flag patch present on the right shoulder of the astronaut?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut's suit shows a patch on the shoulder, which is primarily blue with a yellow border; this is different from the typical design of the American flag patch. Furthermore, the attributes suggest a stylized or fictional representation rather than an authentic American flag patch as seen in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the blue NASA insignia patch visible on the left shoulder of the astronaut?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patch on the shoulder of the astronaut appears to be a blue background with a yellow stripe and star, which does not resemble the NASA insignia. Instead, it suggests a fictional or generic design not related to NASA.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is Earth visible in the reflection within the astronaut’s helmet visor, appearing above the lunar horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a simple, stylized illustration of an astronaut's helmet visor with no visible detailed reflection, like what would be required to see Earth above the lunar horizon. It lacks detailed realism, unlike Image A, where Earth is visible.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the International Space Station visible in the background with its solar panels and modular structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, illustrated space objects are shown, but they do not match the detailed, realistic appearance of the International Space Station. The space station's unique structure with solar panels is not depicted in detail.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the ground beneath the astronaut visibly cratered and gray, consistent with the Moon’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area around the astronaut doesn't show detailed depiction of the lunar surface such as folds; instead, it is a simple abstract background that doesn't clearly represent the Moon's surface.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the astronaut facing forward with both side lights on the helmet illuminated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an illustrated astronaut that is facing forward, but there are no visible side lights on the helmet as depicted in Image A. The illustration focuses on simplification, omitting such details.",
