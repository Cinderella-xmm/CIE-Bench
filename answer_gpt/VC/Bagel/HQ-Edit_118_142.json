      "question": "Does the transformed book retain a rectangular shape with visible binding and page structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the transformed book still maintains a rectangular shape and has a visible binding on the side. The page structure is represented in the diorama beneath the book. This can be discerned easily by noticing the edges that mimic the appearance of pages stacked together. Hence, the book retains its traditional form despite being depicted in a 3D model.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a structure resembling an inkwell, characterized by its typical container form. Although the liquid is not visibly depicted as dark due to its stylized representation in the diorama, the familiar glassy appearance suggests an inkwell filled with ink.",
