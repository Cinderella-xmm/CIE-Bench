      "question": "Is the dorsal ridge composed of a series of raised, looped structures running along the back of the pig?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the dorsal region of the pig is smooth and ceramic, featuring floral designs. There are no raised, looped structures evident on its dorsal side. The ceramic finish adds a glossy look without any textured ridges. Thus, based on world knowledge of ceramic piggy banks and the visible design, there are no looped structures.",

      "question": "Does the tail extend from the rear of the pig and terminate in a fluffy pom-pom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig's tail is neatly formed in ceramic and is part of the overall sleek and glossy look of a typical piggy bank. It definitely does not end in a fluffy pom-pom; rather, it has a smooth, solid design with a simple ceramic tail. Therefore, combining this visual information with knowledge of common ceramic designs, the tail does not have a fluffy pom-pom.",

      "question": "Are there four short legs attached beneath the body, two on each side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, it shows a pig figurine, typical of piggy banks, with four sturdy ceramic legs. Each is molded to be short and well-attached beneath the body, supporting the structure's stability. Common sense about the design of ceramic piggy banks supports the presence of four legs as part of their standard construction.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly depicts a ceramic piggy bank with a rounded protruding snout typical of such designs. The snout is simple, rounded, and forms part of the face. It reflects the common visual elements associated with piggy banks, lending credence to the presence of this design feature.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the piggy bank exhibits two small ears positioned upright at the top of the head, characteristic of piggy bank designs. These ceramic ears are well-integrated into the overall pig shape, providing a pleasing aesthetic typical of pig representations.",
