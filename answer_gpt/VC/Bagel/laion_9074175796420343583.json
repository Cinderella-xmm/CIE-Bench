      "question": "Is the crisscross lattice pattern of pastry strips visible on the pie's surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on a comic character, which is a pie with limbs holding a knife. The pie surface does not visibly feature a crisscross lattice pattern; instead, the pie represents a face with eyes and an apron-like outfit, indicating a cartoon-like representation rather than a realistic pie with pastry strips.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the comic character, a pie with limbs, is holding a knife with a metallic blade and wooden handle. This is evident as the comic intentionally focuses on the pie character wielding the knife, creating a humorous depiction of the pie as a threatening figure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a cartoon character styled as a pie with a face and clothing. There is no indication of realistic pastry details such as a dusting of sugar over a lattice structure. It's a comic depiction, suggesting stylized visual elements over realistic culinary details.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a comic character styled as a pie with a face, but visual details like a uniformly golden brown crust are absent. The illustration emphasizes exaggerated colors typical of cartoons rather than realistic textures and tones found in food photography.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The comic nature of Image B focuses on a pie character with a face and clothing, omitting realistic pie features like fruit filling through lattice gaps. Instead, it engages the viewer with a humorous pie character similar to a person wielding a knife with speech bubbles.",
