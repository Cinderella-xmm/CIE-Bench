        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The second image shows a chibi-style keychain with a figure holding a wand. This character features round glasses, which is a common accessory for certain well-known characters and indicates a distinctive style often used to depict characters with intellectual or magical characteristics. In this case, the glasses are consistent with Harry Potter's iconic look.",

      "question": "Does the chibi-style keychain maintain the brown hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image of the chibi-style keychain, the character is shown with brown hair, aligning with common representations of certain magic-themed characters known for this hair color, such as Harry Potter. This matches the visual cue from the original image in terms of hair color.",

      "question": "Are the white shirt and red-and-yellow striped tie present on the chibi-style keychain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style keychain features a character with a typical school or uniform outfit, but instead of a clearly visible white shirt and red-and-yellow striped tie, the focus is more on the black robe and red-and-yellow scarf. This deviation indicates that the specific wardrobe elements have been altered in the chibi version.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image of the chibi-style keychain shows a character wearing a dark overcoat or cloak, typical of school uniforms in magical environments from world iconography. This suggests that the keychain maintains the theme of the original attire.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style keychain maintain the overall original color scheme, including skin, hair, glasses, shirt, tie, and cloak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the chibi-style keychain retains brown hair and glasses, as well as a dark cloak, it modifies the color scheme slightly by introducing a red-and-yellow scarf rather than a red-and-yellow striped tie. This suggests that not all elements are preserved exactly, leading to an altered color palette overall.",
