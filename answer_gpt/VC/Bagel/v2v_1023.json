      "question": "Are the four individuals still seated together in the same relative positions inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are positioned together inside the snow globe, similar to their arrangement in Image A, which reflects their seating in a cohesive line, indicating consistency in their relative positions. The visual similarity in the character's arrangement suggests that they maintain the same relative seating positions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the chibi-style characters retain identifiable facial features and clothing styles of the original individuals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For Image B, the characters have stylized features typical of chibi art, which exaggerates proportions and minimizes detailed facial features. However, clothing styles such as the colors and types—like jeans and casual tops—remain consistent with Image A. Therefore, while facial features are less defined, clothing styles remain identifiable.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the characters still holding game controllers in their hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly depicts the characters holding game controllers, just like in Image A. The depiction of the characters with controllers in their hands illustrates a consistency in the activity from the original image to the edited version within the snow globe.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question": "Do the characters wear casual clothing styles consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In examining Image B, the characters appear to wear the same casual clothing styles, like light tops, jeans, and casual shoes, that mirror the attire seen in Image A. This similarity supports the consistency in clothing style between the two images.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a representation of a couch or seating area inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the characters sitting on a surface inside the snow globe, but the typical couch or seating structure is not visibly represented as seen in Image A. Instead, they are seated on a flat surface integral to the snow globe base, suggesting the absence of a distinct couch representation.",
