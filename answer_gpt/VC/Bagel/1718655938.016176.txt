    "Question": "Q1: Is there a cross at the very top of the church's steeple?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the steeple of the church is depicted with a simple cross at the top. The edited image uses a simplified, stylized design typical of cartoon-like art.

    "Question": "Q2: Is there a glowing arched doorway located at the front center of the church?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the church lacks any glowing elements. The doorway of the church in the edited image has a vivid red color but doesn't emit any light or glow. Thus, when analyzing the image, the doorway's color and the absence of light emanation are important aspects leading to the conclusion.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Is there a winding dirt path extending from the foreground toward the churchâ€™s entrance?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a stylized church setting with a curved path leading to the entrance, drawn in a smooth arc but represented in solid blocks of color rather than the earthy textured depiction of a dirt path. The style mimics landscapes but doesn't incorporate details like a dirt texture. Therefore, while it depicts a path, it does not have the characteristics of a winding dirt path.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is there a large arched stained-glass window positioned directly above the main entrance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, above the main entrance, a moderately sized window with a distinct arch and blue sections reminiscent of stained glass is present. Recognizing stained-glass patterns typically involves identifying colored sections that suggest such design styles. The window fits the description of an arched stained-glass window highlighted by its form and use of color in the drawing.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q5: Are there two narrow windows flanking the main doorway and one additional window visible on the side wall of the church?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are two arched windows with blue patterns on either side of the front door, typical of simplified church designs. However, the side wall does not visibly feature additional windows. The stylized nature restricts additional detail otherwise visible in realistic scenes, guiding this interpretation of the church layout.",
    "answer": "No"
