    "Question": "Q2: Is there a glowing red-orange metal object resting on the anvil?",
    "explanation": "The image depicts a glowing orange flame emanating from the anvil, suggesting intense heat but is not the typical red-orange hue seen when metal is heated and placed on an anvil. Instead, this suggestive visual is more illustrative rather than one of an active work scenario with metal resting on the anvil.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Is the hammer positioned above or in contact with the glowing metal on the anvil?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer is held by the figure above the anvil; however, it is not positioned directly above or in contact with any glowing metal piece as there is none present.

    "Question": "Q4: Are tongs visible in the blacksmithâ€™s left hand, holding the glowing metal?",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the anvil placed on a circular wooden stump?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the anvil is shown with an ornate base but lacks any visual cues indicating it is on a circular wooden stump. The setting is more illustrative, with an emphasis on its presentation style within the context of the depicted scenario.",

    "Question": "Q6: Is there a stone furnace with a glowing interior visible in the background to the right?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the composition involves an open book with script and ornamentation surrounding the figure, rather than a detailed background depicting a stone furnace with a glowing interior. Such a furnace can be observed only in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is there a second figure in similar attire standing near the furnace in the background?",

    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Are there arched stone doorways visible in the background?",
