    "Question": "Q1: Are the floral and paisley embroidery patterns present and accurately replicated as carved reliefs on the saree?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the saree itself is not present, but instead, we have a stone sculpture where the garment is suggested through carved patterns. However, these do not accurately replicate the intricate floral and paisley embroidery seen in Image A, which is a fabric with detailed embroidery. Carved reliefs in stone generally have limitations in capturing fine textile detail like embroidery.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Is the saree draped with the pallu over the left shoulder and the pleats aligned vertically at the front?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the drapery of the garment on the stone sculpture does not replicate the specific draping style of a saree with a pallu over the shoulder as seen in Image A. Instead, the sculpture features a different stylistic representation, likely inspired by historical or traditional art forms, which do not display pleats and pallu in a fabric-like way.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the multi-layered choker necklace positioned around the neck, with dangling elements visible?",
    "explanation": "Image B, the stone sculpture, shows a carved necklace around the neck, but it lacks the detailed, multi-layered choker design with dangly elements that are visible in Image A. Stone carvings typically include simplified jewelry designs due to material limitations.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the bracelet present on the right wrist, matching the design and placement of the original?",
    "explanation": "Image B does feature a bracelet on the wrist of the sculpture, which corresponds to the concept represented in Image A. Although it’s a carved element, the position is appropriate although the intricate design of a real bracelet can't be matched exactly in stone.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the ring present on the right hand, specifically on the index finger?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stone sculpture’s hand does not include detailed features such as a ring on the index finger, as stone sculptures typically do not include such small jewelry elements due to the difficulty in carving fine details.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the wide, patterned border of the saree preserved along the edges of the pallu and hem?",
    "explanation": "Image B, being a stone sculpture, does not include the saree or its wide, patterned border that is prominent in Image A. The sculpture provides a stylized representation that does not capture the fabric's detailed patterns.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the figure maintain a standing, upright posture with proportional limbs and a balanced silhouette?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stone sculpture maintains a standing, upright posture with a balanced silhouette. This is consistent with the original figure's stance in Image A, where the mannequin is posed with proportional limbs and an upright posture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
