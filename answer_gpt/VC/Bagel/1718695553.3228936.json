      "question": "Is the orange and black tiger stripe pattern present on the hippo’s body, head, and limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see a plush toy with a pattern of orange and black tiger stripes on its body, including the head and limbs. This pattern, which mimics the distinctive appearance of a tiger, is used to characterise the plush toy, not as a realistic animal representation but rather as a decorative design. Combining visual observations and world knowledge about tiger stripe patterns on stuffed animals leads us to conclude that the stripes are present on the entire figure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the visible knitted texture with distinct stitches present on the hippo’s body and the beach ball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture of the hippo and the packaging does not show any knitting or stitches; rather, it appears as a smooth fabric, typically found in plush toys. This contrasts with knitted textures, which have distinct stitching patterns visible. This observation leads us to conclude that there is no visible knitting texture on the hippo. Similarly, the box's design is printed, lacking the knitting textures found on plush fabrics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the face, belly, and limbs of the hippo rendered in light gray color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hippo toy has a white face, belly, and limbs, which is a common neutral color for plush toys, enhancing its visual appeal and differentiation from the striking tiger stripes. By combining visual information with knowledge about typical plush toy designs, the observed gray color is absent on these areas, thus confirmation that they are rendered in white.",
      "weight": 3,

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the beach ball have red, yellow, and white horizontal stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a beach ball. The packaging of the toy is seen, but it has no design elements resembling a beach ball with stripes. This leads us to conclude, from the absence of any such imagery or toys, that the beach ball is not present.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the hippo positioned leaning forward with its front limbs near the beach ball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush toy is positioned standing upright next to its packaging on a flat surface. There is no leaning forward position or beach ball visible in the setup; thus, common knowledge about toys in retail packaging supports the conclusion that the toy is not in this posture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the beach ball round and approximately the same height as the hippo’s torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B shows the hippo toy with its packaging and no beach ball is present, we rely on the visual cues confirming the absence of a beach ball. Therefore, no round object approximating the height of the toy's torso is visible because it simply isn't there.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the hippo have large dark eyes, a small curved smile, and small rounded ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush hippo indeed has large dark eyes, contributing to an expressive and endearing look common in toys. Its facial expression includes a small curved smile, and it has rounded ears which enhance its cute appearance. These visual cues, typical of toys designed to attract children, help confirm the presence of these features.",
