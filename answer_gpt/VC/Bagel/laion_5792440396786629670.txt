    "Question": "Q1: Is there a central root node labeled or represented as 'HOMEPAGE' positioned at the top center of the diagram?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a prominent blue node located centrally at the top, similar to the 'HOMEPAGE' in sitemap diagrams. The design and placement align with common central root nodes in such diagrams, indicating a starting point or homepage. However, it's not explicitly labeled as 'HOMEPAGE' and has whimsical graphics, but its strategic positioning suggests it is equivalent to the 'HOMEPAGE'.",
    "answer": "Yes"
},
{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there exactly five primary branches originating from the HOMEPAGE node, corresponding to PRODUCTS & SOLUTIONS, ABOUT US, EVENTS & RESOURCES, SUCCESS STORIES, and CONTACT US?",
    "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, there are distinct branches diverging from the central blue node at the top. These branches are uniquely colored and follow a logical layout similar to PRIMARY nodes but are not directly labeled with the same names as 'PRODUCTS & SOLUTIONS', 'ABOUT US', etc. This whimsical theme does not match the standard depiction of five precise branches labeled with aforementioned exact phrases.",
    "answer": "No"
},
{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a legend labeled 'SITE MAP KEY' located in the bottom-right corner of the image, showing color codes for different levels?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a section in the bottom-right corner that resembles a legend and follows the convention used in diagrams for site map keys, with color gradients that represent different layers. However, it's not explicitly labeled as 'SITE MAP KEY' similar to the formality in standard sitemaps while still visually indicating a guide to color coding.",
    "answer": "Yes"
},
{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the 'to the web' logo present in the top-left corner of the image?",
    "explanation": "The image B shows a whimsical, colorful image that does not feature a professional or formal logo resembling 'to the web' in the upper-left corner area. The upper-left of Image B has cartoon-like features similar to thematic decorations rather than formal branding typically seen in websites.",
    "answer": "No"
},
{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a FOOTER section containing 'Privacy Policy' and 'Site Map' below the main content area?",
    "explanation": "Image B includes a section labeled FOOTER in the lower part that has elements similar to those used for 'Privacy Policy' and 'Site Map'. These elements have common phrases used in website design, aligning closely with standard web layout conventions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
},
{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there exactly three nodes under the 'SUCCESS STORIES' section, labeled or represented as Case Study #1, #2, and #3?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, under the section that aligns with 'SUCCESS STORIES' from the original sitemap plan, there are elements that may represent equivalent sub-categories, but they are not explicitly labeled as Case Study #1, #2, or #3. They appear in decorative or thematic representation, making it difficult to correlate directly with the specific identifiers of case studies.",
    "answer": "No"
},
{
    "Question": "Q7: Is there a node labeled or represented as 'Product Details' located directly under 'Product #3'?",
    "explanation": "Under sections correlating with 'Product' in Image B, the whimsical and playful style does not provide direct representation or precise labeling as 'Product Details' under a 'Product #3'. This deviation from explicit labeling compared to the standardized original design implies absence.",
    "answer": "No"
}
