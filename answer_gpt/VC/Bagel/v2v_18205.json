    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the horse depicted with a dark mane running along its neck and a long, dark tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse appears to be stylized to resemble a statue and is primarily a white or light color, with no distinctively dark mane or tail visible. Statues are typically monochrome or highlight features differently than in natural depictions.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the elephant have two visible, curved white tusks extending from its mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant also resembles a statue and its tusks, if present, are not clearly distinct in white or vividly visible due to the sculptural style and similar coloring to its body. The stylization may obscure details like tusks.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a flat wooden platform positioned between the horse and the elephant, supporting the horse and resting on the elephant’s back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, transformed into a more artistic, classical sculpture style, shows a platform or pedestal, but its appearance does not distinctly resemble wood as in Image A due to the marble-like texture and color.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both the horse and the elephant depicted in profile view, facing toward the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the horse and the elephant maintain a similar orientation to classical figures, facing left in profile view. Visual orientation elements in classical depictions often mirror naturalistic ones, maintaining the leftward profile.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the elephant have a long, segmented trunk that curls upward at the tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's trunk is indeed visible and curls upward at the tip, consistent with a typical elephant depiction in artistic forms, emphasizing the natural graceful curling.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background a uniform beige color with a subtle paper-like texture and no additional scenery or objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a detailed and vibrant background rather than a uniform beige texture. The presence of figures and a complex scene in the background distinguishes it from a simple, textured setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the horse’s body primarily a rich brown color with black lower legs, mane, and tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The horse in Image B is styled like a marble statue, with no rich brown coloring or specific dark features like a mane and tail; instead, it maintains a monochrome aesthetic with smooth texturing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
