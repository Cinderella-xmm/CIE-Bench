      "question": "Is the blue herringbone-textured jacket retained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, instead of the previous setup with a podium and a blue herringbone-textured jacket, we have an owl character wearing a dark blue cloak. The texture of the clothing is not prominent, and the setup is a complete artistic and narrative shift from the initial speaker image. This change indicates that the specific texture and clothing style of the original jacket are not present or retained.",

      "question": "Are the collar and lapel shape of the blue jacket preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The artistic change to an owl character wearing a cloak has replaced the original person's attire. Cloaks typically have a different structure than jackets; they often lack distinct collars and lapels. Therefore, the jacket's original collar and lapel shapes cannot be preserved under these circumstances.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are two microphones visible in front of the speaker in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the owl character is depicted with speech bubbles, devoid of any microphones. The setting is entirely different; from a speaker setup to an illustrative instructive scene about public speaking, thus changing the elements present.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the speakerâ€™s right hand raised with an open palm in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original composition with a hand gesture as seen with raised palms is wholly transformed into a cartoonish owl character. The owl's wings are raised, but this does not equate to a human's palm gesture, so the original hand gesture is not preserved.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The emblem on the podium in the original image was something typical for a formal speech setting. The edited image presents an owl in a whimsical instructional scene without any podium or emblem. Therefore, these specific features are not visible in the new scene.",
