      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the image composed of two separate panels, with one bird on the left and one on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall composition does not show any dividing line or indication of panels containing birds. Instead, there are figurative representations of birds, specifically abstract sculptures resembling birds, positioned within a shared space. Given this setup, calling them separate panels is misleading.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the bird that was originally on the left still located in the left panel, and the bird that was originally on the right still located in the right panel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B does not contain separate panels or the same real birds as Image A, it cannot be determined that birds from Image A are retained or positioned in a similar location in Image B. Instead, the birds appear as stylized sculptures with distinct forms meant to convey artistic interpretation rather than direct biological counterparts.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the bird on the left have its head turned toward the viewer, with its beak slightly open and facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left sculpture bird appears to be an abstract geometric bird with sharp edges and does not exhibit natural bird features such as a beak being open. It does not have its head turned directly toward the viewer. The nature of artistic depiction does not focus on mimicking the original bird's natural posture.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bird on the right have its body angled such that its back is partially visible and it is facing left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The right bird-like sculpture in Image B is stylized with faceted surfaces and doesn't genuinely mimic an alive bird's posture. It does not appear to show anatomical precision such as a distinct back or typical head orientation like a living bird would. Thus, it cannot be concluded whether it is facing any particular direction in a realistic manner.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the feet of both birds clearly shown gripping a surface beneath them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the birds are shown as sculptures resting on chess piece-like pedestals. There are no detailed anatomical features like feet gripping a surface. The artistic style emphasizes form and design rather than realistic depiction of bird anatomy.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do both birds maintain an upright, balanced silhouette with a distinct head, body, and tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bird sculptures in Image B possess artistic forms with hints of heads, bodies, and tails, maintaining a sense of balance as sculptures on pedestals. Despite their abstract design, they aim to suggest upright bird-like forms.",
