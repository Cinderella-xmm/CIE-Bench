      "question": "Are the pointe shoes visible and correctly positioned on the ballerina’s feet, with ribbons wrapped around the ankles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ballerina is depicted as a cartoon character. Her feet are adorned with ballet slippers, which resemble pointe shoes. They are correctly positioned; however, since it's a simplified drawing, the ribbons are not explicitly shown as wrapped around the ankles. Instead, they are stylized representations of ballet shoes. In Image A, the ballerina wears pointe shoes with ribbons wrapped around the ankles. The cartoon simplification does not provide clear details like in the realistic depiction.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the ballerina wearing a tutu with a layered, flared skirt extending from the waist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon ballerina is wearing a tutu with a flared skirt extending outwards from the waist, showing the classic layered design of tutus. The image maintains the tutu's characteristic shape, similar to what is seen in realistic ballet costumes, as in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the ballerina have her hair styled in a tight bun at the back of her head with straight bangs across her forehead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon ballerina has her hair styled in a tight bun at the back of her head, which is a common hairstyle for ballerinas. However, she does not have bangs; instead, her forehead is clear, with no hair covering it. In Image A, the ballerina's hair is styled similarly in a bun, but it cannot be determined if she has bangs due to the face being obscured.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the ballerina standing en pointe with one leg slightly behind and bent, and the other leg supporting her weight in a balanced position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon ballerina is depicted with both feet side by side and no indication of one leg being bent behind the other or standing en pointe. This reflects a more relaxed pose than the one depicted in Image A, where the ballerina is en pointe, with one leg slightly bent behind and one supporting her weight.",

      "question": "Is the ballerina standing on a wooden floor composed of horizontal planks with visible grain and warm brown tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background does not include any floor details; rather, it is a simplified canvas with floral decorations. There is no visible wooden floor. Image A depicts a realistic wooden floor with horizontal planks, grain visible, and warm brown tones.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon ballerina's head is facing forward without any noticeable tilt upward or to the sides. Without any significant head movement indicated, it does not match the pose where the head is tilted upwards and turned to the right, as visible in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tutu is predominantly pink and includes embellishments like glittery designs, similar to Image A where the tutu is also pink with subtle decorative details. Both images feature a pink tutu with some form of decorative embellishments.",
