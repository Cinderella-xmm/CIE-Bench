    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the perspective of the scene maintain convergence toward the oval skylight at the top, with all architectural lines aligning accordingly?",
    "explanation": "Image B lacks the oval skylight at the top of the spiral staircase. Thus the perspective of the scene in Image B does not converge to the skylight as seen in Image A. Consequently, Image B's architecture does not follow the same perspective convergence as Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the tonal gradients on the walls and floor, particularly the darker shadows near the base and lighter areas under the skylight, preserved?",
    "explanation": "The tonal gradients of shadows are present in Image B, with darker shadows visible near the base and lighter areas indicative of light exposure. This is consistent with what Image A displays, maintaining the same shading to depict light source placement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
