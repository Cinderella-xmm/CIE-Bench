      "question": "Is the fan-shaped headdress with radiating elements present on the warrior’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object in focus appears to be a LEGO-like figurine. The headpiece of this figurine does not have any fan-shaped elements or radiating structures reminiscent of a headdress. LEGO characters usually have simple headgear due to the nature of interlocking bricks, and this figurine has what appears to be straightforward hair pieces instead of a headdress. Therefore, based on the visual observation of Image B combined with common knowledge about LEGO design, the fan-shaped headdress is not present.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a circular emblem located at the center of the chest plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO-like character does have detailed printings on its torso. These often include elements that are meant to represent armor or clothing embellishments. However, upon inspecting the chest area, there is no distinct circular emblem visible at the center of what would constitute its chest plate. Hence, the conclusion is drawn that there is no circular emblem on this figurine.",

      "question": "Is a spear held in the warrior’s right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right hand of the LEGO-like figure is empty, adhering to the typical LEGO design where hands are either holding specific accessories or empty. The design here does not include a spear or any elongated object in its grasp.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the torso and legs covered in layered, scale-like armor pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO-like figure in Image B appears to have printing that signifies some semblance of clothing or armor. However, it lacks the detailed and pronounced texture of layered, scale-like armor. Instead, it features more of a patterned print that simplifies such details due to the scale of LEGO figures.",

      "question": "Is the statue placed on a white pedestal with two visible plaques at the front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO-like figure is presented on a simple pedestal without any complex features like plaques. The white pedestal in the image does not show any signs of plaques at the front, which are typically used for informational purposes in real-world exhibitions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background indicates a gallery setting with other artworks visible on the walls. However, these do not depict detailed framed landscape artworks as described. They appear more abstract and lack sufficient detail to classify as landscapes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the statue centered in the gallery space with equal spacing to the side walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The layout in Image B shows the LEGO-like figure centered on the podium, but due to the angle of the image, it is not apparent if it is equally spaced with respect to the side walls. The reference point regarding side spacing is unclear.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left hand of the LEGO-like figure is not holding any object and remains open. Given the standard LEGO minifigure hand design, it's apparent that no shield-like object is being held.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a LEGO-like minifigure, and typical for these figures, facial features are simplistic and stylized rather than detailed like those in realistic sculptures. It shows generic facial features with printed eyes and mouth, lacking the specifics of broad noses or deep-set eyes as described in the question.",
