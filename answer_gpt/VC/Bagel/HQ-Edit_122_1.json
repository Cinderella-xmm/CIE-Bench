      "question": "Is the vertical cluster of lavender-like flowers with fuzzy purple petals present in the same structural arrangement as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a fantastical setting that includes a humanoid butterfly-like creature with fairy-like features, rather than a realistic butterfly and flowers. The original image (Image A) shows a realistic butterfly on a vertical cluster of flowers. Given the stylized nature of Image B, the flower structure is not maintained. Therefore, the vertical cluster of lavender-like flowers with fuzzy purple petals is not present in the same structural arrangement as in the original image.",

      "question": "Is there a single blue flower with a yellow center located at the top of the flower cluster?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no representation of a realistic flower cluster as depicted in Image A. The scene is transformed into a mystical environment with stylized elements rather than realistic ones. The question refers to a single blue flower with a yellow center, which could relate to an element in Image A; however, these details are absent in Image B with its abstract and fantasy-oriented style.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the butterfly positioned with its legs touching the flower stem, maintaining physical contact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, a butterfly is positioned such that it makes contact with the flower's stem, which is a typical behavior for butterflies in nature. However, Image B has transitioned to featuring a humanoid fairy-like creature without the realistic depiction of flowers or butterflies. This creature is floating and not in contact with any stem structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the wings of the butterfly fully spread in a side profile view, showing both left and right wings symmetrically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the realistic butterfly has its wings spread open, showing a symmetrical side profile. Image B, however, features a fantasy-oriented fairy creature with wings that converge more towards its back and are not spread out like a butterfly's side profile requires. The wings are styled differently, being more ethereal and artistic rather than showcasing a natural symmetry in a side profile.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighting in the image coming from above, casting a warm golden glow over the butterfly and flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A features a warm glow coming from above, which casts a golden light over both the butterfly and flowers. In contrast, Image B, with its fantastical setting, shows illumination that appears to be more diffused and emanates around the fairy-like creature, focusing less on a specific directional light source. The warm golden glow is not as evident and specific as described for Image A.",
