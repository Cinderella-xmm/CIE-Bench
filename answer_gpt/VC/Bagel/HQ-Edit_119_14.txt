    "Question": "Q1: Is the full white beard present on the figureâ€™s face?",
    "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the figure is dressed in a historical Western-style costume with a top hat and a collar. Traditionally, such attire is often associated with individuals depicted in 19th-century paintings, often clean-shaven or with distinct facial hair styles like mustaches. However, no full white beard is apparent or typical for such depictions, especially since the face is blurred.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a red or dark tilak mark positioned between the eyebrows on the forehead?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is dressed in Western attire, and the aesthetic is consistent with Victorian-era imagery where tilak marks are culturally uncommon. Additionally, due to the blurred face area, there is no visible mark that signifies a tilak.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the figure displaying an open-mouthed smile showing teeth?",
    "explanation": "The general depiction of individuals in a historical, formal attire like in Image B, suggests a closed-mouth expression for formal portraits. Since the face is blurred, the expression cannot be assessed directly, but it does not seem typical for the era and style represented.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the figure standing upright with arms relaxed at the sides?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is shown seated, not standing, aligned with the style of formal portraits where one often sits pose with arms placed on a surface or lap. Therefore, the arms are not in a relaxed position at the sides.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the figure shown in full-body view and centered in the frame?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a partial view of the figure, with the area from the torso up visible, fitting a traditional portrait framing where the entire body is not visible. Thus, it is not a full-body view.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the natural skin tone and facial texture (including wrinkles) preserved?",
    "explanation": "Due to the blurring effect applied to the face in Image B, the assessment of natural skin tone and facial texture, including wrinkles, is not possible. The face is intentionally obscured.",
    "answer": "No"
