      "question": "Is the \"Gibson\" logo in gold script visible on the headstock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar headstock region is replaced by a dragon. There is no guitar headstock, hence no 'Gibson' logo visible. Also, common sense tells us logos aren’t found on dragons. Therefore, the correct option is 'No'.",

      "question": "Are there exactly six fiery tendrils extending from the bridge to the headstock area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual clearly depicts a dragon with wings and a fiery appearance, but there are no obvious tendrils that resembles the structure of a guitar's bridge or headstock arrangement. Based on world knowledge of dragons, such tendrils are not commonly found. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.",

      "question": "Is the guitar oriented vertically with the neck pointing upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object shown is not a guitar but a dragon. The orientation of the dragon's body is vertical, but since it is not a guitar, the question of neck orientation becomes irrelevant as there is no guitar neck to assess. Thus, the correct answer is 'No'.",
