    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the chair supported by a five-star base with exactly five legs, each ending in a caster?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chair is made of Lego-like blocks, and the base appears to consist of a typical five-star structure, common in office chairs, with each 'leg' segment terminating in a translucent caster piece. From common design and the structure of Lego sets that mimic real objects, I can conclude that this is representing a five-legged base. Therefore, it maintains the characteristic five-point base structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a separate headrest cushion positioned directly above the main backrest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a section at the top of the Lego chair that mimics the structure of a headrest. It is visually separate from the flat main backrest, appearing like an additional block layer. Common knowledge of chair design shows this is intended to depict a headrest, as it is slightly elevated from the main continuous backrest structure.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there two armrests, one on each side, extending horizontally from the chairâ€™s midsection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chair features two distinct armrest structures on either side. They are constructed from lighter-colored Lego pieces that protrude horizontally from the sides of the chair's main body section, consistent with the understanding of typical armrest positioning.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the backrest vertically aligned behind the seat, rising from the same central axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Lego backrest is constructed vertically and affixes directly behind the seat section, maintaining a central alignment. This assembly mirrors the structural design of most standard chairs where the backrest vertically rises from the seat with a shared central axis.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the chair maintain a tall, high-back silhouette with the headrest significantly higher than the seat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a chair structure where the vertical backrest, combined with the separately elevated headrest section, creates a tall and high silhouette. This construct significantly surpasses the seat level in height, consistent with a high-back chair design.",
