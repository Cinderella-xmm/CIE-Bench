      "question": "Do both bears retain their round and fluffy body shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bears have round and fluffy body shapes, similar to typical stuffed animal designs that are commonly used to convey a soft and comforting appearance. This round shape is consistent with their appearance, as their limbs and bodies are rounded and lack sharp angles, which aligns with how stuffed animals or cartoon characters are typically depicted to emphasize cuddliness.",

      "question": "Are the bears still seated next to each other, maintaining their companionship pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows both bears seated next to each other. Their positioning indicates closeness and companionship, much like how paired items in a set are used to signify unity or togetherness. This is similar to toys placed together to show they are a pair, emphasizing their bond or relationship.",

      "question": "Does the background still include a clear sky with soft clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background cannot be seen as the bears are set against a plain colored backdrop typical in product photography to isolate subjects. This differs significantly from Image A, where the bears are outdoors against a picturesque sky with clouds. Therefore, the clear sky with soft clouds is absent in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature any grass or flowers around the bears. Instead, it shows them on a neutral surface or platform typically used in product photography to avoid distractions from the main subjects. This contrasts with Image A, where the natural setting includes grass and daisies surrounding the bears.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both bears display paw pads on their feet, which are typical features seen on stuffed animal designs to simulate real animal characteristics and add cute and recognizable details. The paw pads are distinct, with a contrasting color from the fur, emphasizing their presence.",
