      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the elderly man in a tai chi stance with his right leg bent in a lunge, left leg raised behind him, right hand forming an \"ok\" gesture near his face, and left hand resting at his waist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the elderly man is depicted as a line drawing in a tai chi pose. His right leg is bent, supporting his body, and although the left leg is raised, it is not completely behind him like a lunge position. His right hand is forming an 'ok' gesture near his face while his left hand stays positioned at the waist. Tai chi stances are usually portrayed with balance and traditional pose gestures, as seen. This common stance is depicted in both images, confirming an aspect of tai chi practice.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the manâ€™s feet bare, with the right foot flat on the tile and the left foot raised behind him?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, it is a line drawing of the man, and details like bare feet or their positioning cannot be accurately discerned. The right leg is supporting the balance, but without detail like in an actual photograph, this information isn't explicit.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the man wear a light blue traditional robe with wide sleeves and visible fabric folds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the man is illustrated in a line drawing with a robe that mimics traditional attire with wide sleeves and style consistent with martial arts wear. However, without color indications, the robe cannot be confirmed as light blue. Image B does maintain the elements visible in such traditional dresses, visible in folds and sleeve styles.",

      "question": "Are there cherry blossom trees with pink flowers and curved dark trunks lining a path in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains cherry blossom illustrations with stylized pink flowers and dark curved branches, indicative of cherry blossoms, spread across the background. While details can be accentuated in drawings, it serves thematic consistency with a scene involving cherry blossoms.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the man standing on a surface composed of large square tiles with visible grout lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The foreground in image B has no detailed rendering of a tiled surface due to its minimalist drawing style focusing on the man's pose and posture. Therefore, specific surface conditions like tiles or grout lines aren't present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a minimalist line drawing that implies an elderly man with long hair and a beard, consistent with how elderly wise figures are often portrayed, though exact colors like 'white' can't be determined strictly from line work.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the man positioned in the foreground, facing toward the right side of the image, with a curved path receding into mist behind him and a bright light source in the upper-right corner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the line drawing places the man facing right, similar to image A. However, elements like mist or bright light sources are contextually absent in a stylized illustration. The curved path represented in the drawing lacks the depth needed to illustrate mist or specific lighting.",
