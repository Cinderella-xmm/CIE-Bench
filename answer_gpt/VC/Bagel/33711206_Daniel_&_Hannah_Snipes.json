      "question": "Is the woman wearing a rust-colored cardigan over a white top and a long white skirt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is depicted wearing a rust-colored cardigan over a white garment that resembles a long white skirt. This interpretation is based on the colors used to paint the clothing, as well as the typical style associated with such garments, blending world knowledge about typical clothing layers with the visual cues of the watercolored picture.",

      "question": "Does the child wear a green floral sundress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child is illustrated wearing a green dress adorned with a simple design rather than a clear floral pattern. The style and cut of the dress resemble a common sundress shape, often seen in children's clothing, and the green hue matches typical sundress color schemes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a wooden bench upon which the woman is sitting and the child is standing. This conclusion is reached by noticing the horizontal brown structure, combined with common knowledge regarding the structure and appearance of benches.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background does not contain architectural details like a house with a dormer window. Instead, it focuses on floral and natural decorative elements surrounding the figures, reflecting a more abstract and artistic choice.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes orange flowers as part of a decorative border, but there's no direct painted representation of purple and white flowers or a complete flowerbed setting behind the bench, unlike the more direct presentation in realistic imagery.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are both the woman and the child extending their hands toward each other?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both figures extend their hands toward each other, which suggests an interaction between them. This kind of gesture is often used in illustrations to signify communication or a shared activity between the characters.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses on an illustrative style with plain, painted elements. It does not distinctly show grass or gravel textures, instead having a clean, painted backdrop that emphasizes the characters over surrounding environmental details found in more realistic scenes.",
