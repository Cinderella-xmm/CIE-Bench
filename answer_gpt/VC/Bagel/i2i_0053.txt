    "Question": "Q1: Are the bananas represented with their characteristic elongated curve and yellow color?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bananas are illustrated with a cartoonish style that maintains the essential features—an elongated curve and a yellow color—typical of real bananas. These aspects are visually simplified but match the common depiction expected of bananas.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the banana holder depicted with a curved metal arm supported by a wooden base?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a cartoonish but recognizable representation of a banana holder with a clearly curved metal arm. The support seems to be a wooden base, which is a typical design for such stands, even if visually simplified in the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the bananas still rest naturally on the curved metal arm?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, although it's a stylized depiction, it is clear that the bananas are positioned on the metal arm of the holder, suggesting that they rest on it, in line with how bananas would naturally hang on such a support.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the bananas shown in a bunch, connected at the top?",
    "explanation": "Image B portrays two bananas that appear to be connected at the top, which is consistent with how bananas naturally grow in a bunch, maintaining that part of the characteristic arrangement despite the simplistic illustration style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the wooden base of the banana holder retain its wood-like texture?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a flat, cartoon-style representation of the base, lacking detailed texture. Although it suggests a wooden base through shape and color, it doesn't really retain the detailed wood-like texture found in a more realistic representation.",
    "answer": "No"
