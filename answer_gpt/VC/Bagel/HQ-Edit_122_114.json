      "question": "Is the window located at the top center of the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the window is clearly located at the top center of the house's front façade. This positioning is typical in an A-frame house where the window aligns with the central peak of the triangular front. The window is perfectly aligned with the peak part of the roof, indicating its central location.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the chimney positioned on the left side of the roof?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chimney is not visible at all. The absence of a chimney is noticeable, as the primary focus is instead on the intricate gears and mechanical elements. Given this assessment, we can conclude that the chimney is neither on the left side nor the right side of the roof.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the house have an A-frame roof with a pointed peak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The house in Image B has a stereotypical A-frame architecture with a sharply pointed peak, characterized by its triangular shape. This structure is commonly associated with A-frame buildings, where the roof forms an 'A' shape, using the peak as the central point.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a large circular opening in the front of the house where the nest is located?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no large circular opening at the front of the house that would typically accommodate a nest. Instead, the front is dominated by mechanical gears and machinery elements, indicating a transformation from the natural elements depicted in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Is the stork located inside the nest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there isn’t a real stork or a natural nest. Instead, there is a metallic bird incorporated into the machinery, suggesting a transformation from biological to mechanical design. Thus, there is no organic nest for a stork to be positioned inside.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question": "Are there yellow flowers and a path visible in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground is devoid of natural elements like yellow flowers or paths. The focus is entirely on mechanical gears and the house structure, indicating a shift from nature elements, unlike Image A which has a natural setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are green trees and a textured sky visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is plain, without any depiction of green trees or a textured sky. The emphasis is on the house and its mechanical features with no indications of natural landscapes or sky elements.",
