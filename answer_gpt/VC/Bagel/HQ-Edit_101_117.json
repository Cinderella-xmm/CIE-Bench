      "question": "Are the floral and paisley embroidery patterns present and accurately replicated as carved reliefs on the saree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the saree itself is not present, but instead, we have a stone sculpture where the garment is suggested through carved patterns. However, these do not accurately replicate the intricate floral and paisley embroidery seen in Image A, which is a fabric with detailed embroidery. Carved reliefs in stone generally have limitations in capturing fine textile detail like embroidery.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the saree draped with the pallu over the left shoulder and the pleats aligned vertically at the front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drapery of the garment on the stone sculpture does not replicate the specific draping style of a saree with a pallu over the shoulder as seen in Image A. Instead, the sculpture features a different stylistic representation, likely inspired by historical or traditional art forms, which do not display pleats and pallu in a fabric-like way.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the multi-layered choker necklace positioned around the neck, with dangling elements visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, the stone sculpture, shows a carved necklace around the neck, but it lacks the detailed, multi-layered choker design with dangly elements that are visible in Image A. Stone carvings typically include simplified jewelry designs due to material limitations.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bracelet present on the right wrist, matching the design and placement of the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does feature a bracelet on the wrist of the sculpture, which corresponds to the concept represented in Image A. Although it’s a carved element, the position is appropriate although the intricate design of a real bracelet can't be matched exactly in stone.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the ring present on the right hand, specifically on the index finger?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone sculpture’s hand does not include detailed features such as a ring on the index finger, as stone sculptures typically do not include such small jewelry elements due to the difficulty in carving fine details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the wide, patterned border of the saree preserved along the edges of the pallu and hem?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, being a stone sculpture, does not include the saree or its wide, patterned border that is prominent in Image A. The sculpture provides a stylized representation that does not capture the fabric's detailed patterns.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone sculpture maintains a standing, upright posture with a balanced silhouette. This is consistent with the original figure's stance in Image A, where the mannequin is posed with proportional limbs and an upright posture.",
