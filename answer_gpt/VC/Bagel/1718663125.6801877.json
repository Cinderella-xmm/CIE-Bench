      "question": "Is the crown-like forehead design with three dots and a central triangle present on the child's forehead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the clothing and hairstyle indicate a more traditional or historical attire with intricate designs, suggesting that the focus is on the attire rather than facial details. The forehead design described does not appear to be present based on available visual cues and the nature of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the lace-like borders encircling the eyes clearly visible and symmetrically drawn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the use of detailed patterns is seen in the clothing rather than around the eyes. The image primarily depicts attire with ornate designs, and there are no visual indicators of lace-like borders encircling the eyes symmetrically.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the mouth depicted with a stitched, jagged-tooth pattern and vertical lines extending from the nose to the chin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses on the traditional dress and hair, with no emphasis on a jagged-tooth pattern around the mouth or vertical lines. Given the style and attire, such a depiction would be unusual and is not indicated visually.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the eyes positioned symmetrically and maintain their original almond shape and direct forward gaze?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The editing in Image B emphasizes period attire and hairstyle without visible details of eyes because of the blurred area; however, the subject seems to be postured in a manner consistent with symmetry in historical attire. Based on this, any visible eyes would likely follow traditional portrait symmetry.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the makeup pattern symmetrically aligned across the left and right sides of the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The focus of Image B is on the elaborate attire, not on facial makeup. Thereâ€™s no indicated makeup pattern due to the concentration on the clothing's symmetrical and detailed design. Thus, any makeup pattern, if present, is not perceivable.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the nose bridge clearly defined and retains its original shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the blurred area in Image B, specific details such as the nose bridge are not visible. However, considering traditional portraiture conventions, were it visible, the nose would likely adhere to its natural shape and position.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the natural lip contours visible beneath the painted teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the intention is to showcase attire from a historical point, with no indication of painted teeth or lip details as part of the focus. There are no visible painted teeth over natural lip contours.",
