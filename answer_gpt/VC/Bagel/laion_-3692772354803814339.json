        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brand name \"LAPHROAIG\" is prominently displayed on both the bottle and the cylindrical packaging.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no text on the bottle or packaging that says \"PX CASK\". The design is elaborate with oceanic themes and compass imagery, but specific terms like \"PX CASK\" are not visible here",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design focuses on nautical elements such as a compass and ocean waves, deviating from traditional logos involving crowns or intricate intertwined designs often seen in heraldic symbolism. There is no presence of a crest-like logo.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) does not display \"ISLAY SINGLE MALT SCOTCH WHISKY\". Instead, the packaging has a more artistic and thematic design focused on maritime imagery, which seems to replace the whisky category text with visual storytelling.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging in Image B features artistic elements like a wave and a compass but lacks the black-and-white illustration of a coastal distillery scene. This suggests a conceptual rather than a documentary design approach to whisky representation.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the detailed ornamental design does not include the phrase \"Pedro Ximénez Sherry.\" This absence indicates a design choice towards a different thematic expression than providing specific whisky maturation details.",
