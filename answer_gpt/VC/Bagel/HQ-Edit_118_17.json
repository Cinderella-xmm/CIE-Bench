      "question": "Is the multi-tiered gabled roof with overlapping sections and sharp angles present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the edited image, the building inside the glass case has several distinct tiers with gabled roofs that overlap each other and form sharp angles. This structure is characteristic of many traditional architectural styles, where such roofing helps in efficiently managing rainwater runoff and providing a visually appealing form. This comparison is evident when observing the roof, which maintains multiple levels of gables stacked on top of each other, much like in the original image A.",

      "question": "Are the dragon-head finials present at each corner of the roof ridges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing image B, the edited image, shows dragon-head finials at various corners and peaks of the roof ridges. These finials are traditional decorative elements used to embellish structures and convey cultural significances, often seen in Norse architecture. When comparing with image A, it's clear that these ornate features are preserved on the model as well.",

      "question": "Is the central spire topped with a Christian cross still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the edited image, the spire features a cross at the very top, indicating it's maintained from the original design. Spires topped with crosses are typical in church architecture, symbolizing religious affiliation. Image A further supports this observation, as it features a similar cross-topped spire.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the dark weathered wooden texture of the exterior walls preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing image B reveals a stylized depiction of the structure resembling polished or painted wood, with less evidence of weathering seen in natural wood. In contrast, image A displays a dark, weathered wooden texture typical of aged wood exposed to elements. This indicates a loss of texture detail in the edited version.",

      "question": "Is the symmetrical layout with a raised platform and steps leading to the entrance maintained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a building model with a symmetrical design, including an entrance featuring steps leading upwards, much like the setup seen in image A. This architectural symmetry and entrance setup are typical for grand buildings, providing a formal access point that is easily recognizable in both images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the carved wooden details visible along the eaves and window frames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the model does not prominently display intricate carved details along the eaves and window frames as seen in a real structure like in image A, which offers visible wooden carvings that add artisanal value to the architecture. The model seems simplified, perhaps to fit the confines of a miniature representation, thereby omitting these finer details.",
