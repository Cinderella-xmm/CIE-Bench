      "question": "Is the clock face circular and positioned in the center of the wooden frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face is circular and centrally positioned within the glass frame. It is framed with intricate glass detailing. World knowledge helps to recognize that clocks generally have a circular face to evenly space the numerals. Since the question asks about the wooden frame, and Image B features a glass frame, the question might not be applicable here in a direct sense, but if interpreted regarding the glass frame in Image B, the answer would still be relevant.",

      "question": "Are the Roman numerals arranged in clockwise order from I to XII around the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the Roman numerals on the clock face are indeed arranged in a clockwise sequence starting from I to XII, which is a typical configuration for clock faces. This allows easy readability and accurate time representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the pendulum hang directly below the clock face, supported by two vertical rods?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a decorative crystal pendant hanging directly below the clock face. However, it is attached by a single thin chain, not two vertical rods. Common pendulum clocks usually have a pendulum hanging on a rod, but this image features a crystal decorative piece instead.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there two fluted columns, one on each side of the clock face, extending from the top to the bottom of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a glass clock without fluted columns. The design is sleek and modern with no indication of traditional wooden fluted columns. Therefore, the presence of columns is not applicable here.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock features a purely glass and crystal design, without any wooden elements or carvings. A crest with leaf-like carvings typically aligns with traditional wood-carved clocks and is absent in this modern design.",
