    {

      "question": "Is the dancer wearing a tall, flame-shaped golden headdress with upward-curving elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is depicted with a headdress, but the design of this headdress is not flame-shaped with upward-curving elements. The image presents a more simplified version without detailed upward-curving elements. Therefore, based on the visual information from Image B, the headdress does not match the described characteristics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dancer have white-painted skin, darkened eyes, and red lips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dancer with a skin tone that does not predominantly feature the described characteristics: white-painted skin, darkened eyes, and red lips. The edited image presents more of a neutral skin tone without these specific face painting elements. Therefore, Image B lacks these descriptions.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the dancer in a dynamic pose with one arm raised near the head and the other extended forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's pose matches the description of being in a dynamic position with one arm raised near the head and the other extended forward. This positioning suggests movement and aligns with the provided description.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the temple composed of multiple stacked tiers with curved, upward-pointing roofs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the temple with multiple stacked tiers, but the design is simplified and shows straight lines mostly, suggesting a stylistic representation rather than a detailed portrayal like that of Image A. It does not include curved, upward-pointing roofs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two large mythical creatures flanking the dancer on either side. These creatures appear symmetrical in positioning and form, consistent with the description provided.",

      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show smaller seated statues beneath the large mythical creatures. The edited image focuses on the larger elements without including smaller details like the seated statues found in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question": "Does the dancer wear a visible gold necklace and bracelets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer has a dress decorated with intricate designs, but she is not depicted wearing a separately visible gold necklace and bracelets. The edited image uses simpler illustrations without these detailed accessories.",
