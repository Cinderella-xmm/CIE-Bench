      "question": "Are the two cylindrical corner towers still present at the left and right ends of the castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the castle is encased within a snow globe featuring a fantastical design, which includes cylindrical towers with conical roofs on either side. The design is stylized and miniature, but the presence of towers at both ends is still visibly replicated in the globe's architecture. In comparison, Image A displays the original scene where cylindrical towers are prominent components on each side of the castle facade. Therefore, visually and conceptually considering both images, they both maintain cylindrical towers at the corners.",

      "question": "Do the two central square turrets with pointed finials remain atop the central section of the castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the castle does possess turret-like features in its design, but the explicit depiction of square turrets with pointed finials is altered to suit a more whimsical interpretation; only one turret has a dragon instead of a finial. In Image A, however, there are clear square turrets with finials at the central section. Therefore, the Image B does not fully replicate this specific design in its altered interpretation.",

      "question": "Is the large central arched entranceway still present and centrally aligned with the pathway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a castle within a snow globe where an arched entranceway is present and centrally aligned with the decorative path leading towards it. While the presentation is stylized and reduced in scale, the entrance serves the same positional function visually. Image A also showcases a central arched entrance aligned with an actual pathway, thus both images essentially maintain similar architectural positioning.",

      "question": "Are the arched windows and openings arranged symmetrically across the front facade of the castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains windows and openings, yet owing to its stylized form within a snow globe, the symmetrical arrangement is varied for artistic interpretation. Image A, however, presents a clear and traditional symmetry with arched windows spaced evenly across the facade. Due to the fantasy elements incorporated into the snow globe design, Image B departs from symmetry.",

      "question": "Is the castle still constructed from dark gray and reddish-brown stone blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the castle principally formed of what looks like brown stone with no detailed color differentiation akin to dark gray or reddish-brown seen in traditional stonework, rather opting for hues and a textural surface compatible with miniature crafting visuals within the globe. Image A showcases red and brown tones applicable to real stone architecture. Therefore, Image B diverges from the original stone appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the upper portion of the castle still open to the sky, revealing the lack of a roof and internal framework?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entirety of the castle's top portion is enclosed within a snow globe, featuring decorative elements such as clouds within the dome covering. It does not present any visible open-to-the-sky structure physically, unlike Image A, which showcases an exposed interior beyond the front facade. Image B's interpretation negates openness to the sky.",

      "question": "Does the central arched entranceway align directly with the center of the gravel pathway leading toward it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a defined path in the form of steps leading to an arched entranceway is centrally positioned within the globe design, providing alignment within its sculpted depiction. Image A also shows the same alignment observed in the actual gravel pathway leading towards the castle entrance. Therefore, both images convey a central alignment from entrance to pathway contextually.",
