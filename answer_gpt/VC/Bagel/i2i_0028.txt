    "Question": "Q2: Are there exactly three teddy bears, each with a distinct red shirt containing a blessing text?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are three teddy bears, each wearing distinct red shirts. However, the text on the shirts doesn't read as normal language; instead, it seems to mimic text but isn't legible. This reflects artistic style rather than conveying specific messages as blessings. In Image A, the text is clear. Hence, the question technically could be answered as no referring to legible blessings.",
