      "question": "Do the nesting dolls maintain a triangular shape inspired by the pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nesting dolls in Image B have a conical, pyramid-like top which resembles the triangular aspect of a pyramid. Their overall silhouette is rounded with a pointed top, similar to the triangular structure of a pyramid. Thus, they maintain a triangular shape inspired by the pyramid.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the nesting dolls retain the stone texture seen in the original pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls have a smooth and polished finish with painted features, which differs from the rough and irregular stone texture seen in the pyramid of Image A. The dolls are clearly made of a different material that does not emulate the texture of stone.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the nesting dolls designed with a symmetrical structure similar to the original pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nesting dolls in Image B have a symmetrical design, as each doll is evenly shaped and the features are consistent and mirrored on either side. This is similar to the symmetrical structure of the pyramid in Image A, where the left and right sides mirror each other.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nesting dolls in Image B are placed in order from the largest on the left to the smallest on the right, creating a descending size sequence. This is a recognizable arrangement from left to right, visibly showing a decrease in size.",

      "question": "Do the largest nesting doll and possibly others incorporate a design element resembling the pyramid's central entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls do not feature any design element that resembles the central entrance of the pyramid from Image A. There is no visible doorway or opening-like design on the dolls that mimics the architectural detail of the entrance seen in the pyramid.",
