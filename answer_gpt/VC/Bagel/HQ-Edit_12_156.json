      "question": "Does the structure retain four distinct legs forming a wide base that converge upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure resembles an abstract or fantasy-themed version of a tower. The base appears to partly have four distinct legs but they're obscured and integrated into a more mythical and artistic design that involves vines and crystal elements. While the structure sits in a wide base, the clear distinctness of the four legs is artistically altered or not as prominent. However, since it forms a wide base converging upward, it largely aligns with the concept but is not clear if in the same defined way as a traditional structure like the Eiffel Tower. Since the legs are not as distinct, the answer leans towards 'No'.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the tower’s shape vertically tapered, narrowing progressively from base to spire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower visually narrows progressively from its base to its spire, adhering to the vertical tapering concept. This tapering culminates in a pointed, luminous crystal element at the top, which suggests a progressive narrowing characteristic of vertical tapering. It maintains this tapering flair artistically enhanced with fantasy elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there three distinct horizontal levels or platforms visible along the tower’s height?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no clear distinct horizontal platforms or levels are visible. The design focuses more on a fantasy and artistic representation with decorative elements rather than traditional structural layers. The emphasis is on the adornments and embellishments rather than distinct horizontal platforms, hence the answer is 'No'.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tower centrally positioned in the image, aligned with the center of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower is centrally positioned within the image frame. This central alignment is visually noticeable as the tower's base and spire form the main focus and axis point from the bottom to the top of the image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a straight, symmetrical pathway extending from the foreground directly toward the base of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible straight, symmetrical pathway extending from the foreground to the base of the tower. The focus is predominantly on the embellished tower and its fantasy elements, and not on any pathway. The foreground is integrated with artistic elements rather than a clear defined path.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the light source (sun or equivalent) located directly behind the base of the tower, creating a halo effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no clear or explicit depiction of a light source directly behind the base of the tower creating a halo effect. The image's lighting and background are more ethereal and cosmic, with colors and effects suggesting fantasy elements instead of a singular light source like a sun behind the base.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible cityscape in the background. The background is composed of vivid, cosmic, and ethereal patterns that contribute to the fantasy or mythical theme, rather than a realistic urban or city background.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower is the focal point and significantly tall, visually dominating the vertical space of the image. There are no other structures present to contrast its prominence, affirming that it dominates the image vertically.",
