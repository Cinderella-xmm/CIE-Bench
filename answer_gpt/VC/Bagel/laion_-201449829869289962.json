        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bell tower is topped with an onion-shaped dome, which is a common architectural feature. This feature is consistent with Image A, where the dome is a prominent part of the design. Thus, the feature is retained in the same form.",
