    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image contain exactly six labeled process stages corresponding to the CRISP-DM phases?",
    "explanation": "The edited image is a cartoon illustration, representing different animals and speech bubbles. It does not contain any labeled process stages or structures akin to CRISP-DM phases, which are typically involved in data mining processes. The illustration instead features characters expressing messages through speech bubbles but unrelated to CRISP-DM phases.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the six stages arranged in the correct sequential order: Business Understanding → Data Understanding → Data Preparation → Modeling → Evaluation → Deployment → back to Business Understanding?",
    "explanation": "The edited image is cartoon-like with no visible progression or arrangement of stages related to CRISP-DM. There are no discernible stages or flow in the artwork that mimics a procedural or sequential order such as the described CRISP-DM sequence.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a bidirectional connection (e.g., two-way path or mutual interaction) between the 'Business Understanding' and 'Data Understanding' stages?",
    "explanation": "The edited image is a cartoon depicting animals with speech and unrelated to any stages like 'Business Understanding' or 'Data Understanding'. There are no visual traits suggesting stages or their connections; instead, it shows whimsical dialogue.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a bidirectional connection (e.g., two-way path or mutual interaction) between the 'Data Preparation' and 'Modeling' stages?",
    "explanation": "The cartoon illustration lacks any formal diagrammatic representation of stages akin to 'Data Preparation' or 'Modeling'. There are no implied bidirectional paths or connections in this humorous and abstract artwork.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a central data source located at the center of the diagram, accessible to all six stages?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, there is no formal structure indicating a central data source or diagrammatic portrayal at all. Rather, the focus is on colorful characters and dialogues not centered around stages, thus no centralized data source is evident.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the diagram include a clear return path from the 'Deployment' stage back to the 'Business Understanding' stage, completing the cycle?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, there's no diagram at all to exhibit stages related to 'Deployment' or 'Business Understanding', let alone a circular path. Instead, it is a static cartoon featuring dialogues among animated characters.",
    "answer": "No"
