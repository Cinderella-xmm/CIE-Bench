      "question": "Are the two upright, pointed ears with black outer edges and pinkish-red inner patterns present on the mask?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mask prominently features two upright, pointed ears with black outer edges. These are similar to the stylized depiction of a fox or cat. The inner regions have pinkish-red patterns, reflective of traditional Japanese design motifs often seen in masks to indicate fox spirits or other mythical creatures. This visual cue strongly aligns with the presence of such ears as described.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mask's design includes stylized depictions of eyes. These are not clear human eyes but rather artistic interpretations often seen in traditional mask art. The eyes are a part of the mask's overall facial design, and do not represent clear, visible human eyes through openings, reflecting a strong artistic aesthetic.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts an illustration of a kimono with clear patterns of a V-shaped neckline. The design suggests wide sleeves extending from the shoulders, typical of traditional kimono garments, signified by the use of flowing lines and patterns resembling traditional kimono designs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of a clearly defined sash or obi positioned horizontally across the chest. The design is abstract and focuses on the essential elements of traditional Japanese clothing but does not specifically include a sash element that corresponds with conventional kimono attire.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mask in Image B uses a stylized design that includes artistic elements resembling whiskers. However, they do not distinctly alternate in black and white; rather, they follow a color pattern that blends with the overall mask design for aesthetic effect, not clearly standing out as three distinct whiskers in alternating colors.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays an artistic mask wherein the nose is centrally located below the stylized eyes, depicted as a small black oval, which is characteristic of illustrative art suggesting animalistic features. Beneath the nose, a faint mouth line is also visible, consistent with designs representing a calm expression often seen in fox or animal masks.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design of Image B follows a symmetrical composition, as reflected by the symmetrical placement of the ears, eyes, and other decorative elements relative to the vertical axis. This balance is a key feature in many traditional and stylized artworks to ensure visual harmony, which is effectively achieved in this image.",
