      "question": "Is the anvil’s pointed horn still present and positioned at the same end of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the anvil retains its pointed horn, which is a common feature of anvils used in metalwork allowing the working of metals with different shapes. The presence of the horn in the edited image is visually evident and it is located at the same end of the anvil as typical in design, contributing to its functional integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the hammer retain a wooden handle connected to its head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer appears to be resting on the anvil with a handle that seems to be connected to the hammerhead. While the handle is shown with some moss or organic elements, it still retains the general shape and functionality of a wooden handle connecting to the head.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hammer resting diagonally across the anvil’s flat surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the hammer is clearly positioned diagonally across the anvil’s flat surface, contributing to the typical arrangement seen in workspaces where a hammer might be used in conjunction with an anvil. Its orientation enhances the impression of readiness for use.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a multi-paned window with frosted glass visible on the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no window visible at all. Instead, the background consists of natural elements like a tree trunk. The setting is transformed into an outdoor or forest environment rather than an indoor workshop setting, deviating from any indication of a window or glass.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are multiple metal tools mounted vertically on the greenish-gray wooden wall behind the anvil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background does not consist of a wooden wall with tools. Instead, it shows a natural environment with a tree and other organic features. Hence, there is no presence of vertically mounted metal tools as there is no wall to mount them on.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are green ivy leaves visible growing over the window frame and wrapping around the base of the anvil and hammer handle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the environment is transformed with lush plant life, but the specific arrangement of ivy leaves over a window frame and around the base of the anvil and hammer handle is not present. Any foliage appears in a natural forested setting rather than intertwined specifically with constructed objects like a window frame or anvil.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the anvil sitting on a wooden workbench showing signs of wear and dust accumulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting where the anvil is placed looks entirely natural without any constructed structures like a wooden workbench. The anvil rests on what appears to be a natural surface, devoid of any signs of carpentry or accumulated dust, indicating a departure from the workshop aesthetics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there visible roots and organic debris scattered on the surface of the workbench?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a natural setting where an anvil appears integrated with roots and organic material, but there is no constructed workbench in this scene. The environment suggests the anvil is part of a forest ecosystem rather than sitting on a man-made structure where debris might accumulate.",
