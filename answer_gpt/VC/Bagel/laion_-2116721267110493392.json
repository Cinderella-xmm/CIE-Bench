      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we can observe a boy who is illustrated without any hair, which is commonly interpreted as being bald. The character's head has no hair, indicating baldness. Given this visual cue and typical interpretations, it can be concluded that the boy is depicted as bald.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boy is illustrated without any visible eyewear, including black-framed glasses. Visual cues such as shape or color typical of black-framed glasses are absent, leading to the conclusion that the first boy does not wear glasses.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bald boy is depicted holding a device (in this case, a book or tablet) with both hands in a manner that suggests careful holding. However, this device is not a tablet in an upright position. The position of the device is more casual, as it appears to be held in a reading position. Therefore, the bald boy does not hold a tablet upright.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boy does not wear glasses and neither is there a posture indicating leaning forward toward a tablet. The illustration shows a seated and upright posture without any inclination towards any device or object that might suggest leaning. Thus, he is not leaning forward.",

      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no tablet screen visible as the characters are depicted holding books instead. Thus, no colorful indoor scene is displayed on a tablet screen.",
