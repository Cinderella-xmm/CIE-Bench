      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (B), the girl is wearing a dress with lace detailing at both the collar and cuffs. The lace appears ornamental and detailed, indicating that the design has been retained. Similarly, in Image A, the lace details are visible at the same locations. The use of lace is a stylistic element that is typically carried over when translating a design from one format to another, such as from a real dress to a stylized depiction. These observations confirm that the edited image retains the lacework details.",

      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the puffed sleeves and fitted bodice design?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sleeves are designed to be puffed, and the bodice is fitted, which is consistent with a Victorian style, similar to an hourglass shape fashionable in historical women's wear. Image A also presents a similar design with puffed sleeves and a fitted bodice, reflecting a traditional style that emphasizes the silhouette. Comparing the two, it is clear that the puffed sleeves and fitted bodice have been maintained in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress features a full skirt that flares out from the waist, which is a typical characteristic of historical gowns designed for grandeur and volume. Similarly, in Image A, the dress also has a full skirt starting from the waistline. The visual similarity in the dress design suggests that Image B maintains this aspect of the original design.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (B) does not visibly display any detailed floral pattern or texture on the fabric of the dress. Instead, it appears as a plain black fabric without intricate designs. In Image A, the dress distinctly shows a floral pattern texture. This difference indicates that the texture has not been preserved in the stylized rendering of Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no button closures visible down the front of the bodice. This simplification is common in stylized or animated renditions where minute details might be omitted for a cleaner, more exaggerated look characteristic of stylized representations. In contrast, Image A clearly depicts a series of button closures running down the front of the bodice, indicating that these have not been included in the edited image.",
