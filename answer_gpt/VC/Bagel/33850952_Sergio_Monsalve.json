      "question": "Are there at least eight distinct horizontal levels stacked vertically along the building facade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a creative rendition of an octopus-like alien creature is depicted, which features no building or architectural elements. Therefore, there are no distinct horizontal levels stacked vertically, as the object in the image does not relate to building structures. Hence, applying this understanding to the concept of a building facade with levels, the answer based on Image B is No.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a transparent railing structure visible on each balcony, positioned directly outside the windows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any buildings, balconies, or railing structures. Instead, it features an elaborate, otherworldly creature reminiscent of a science fiction concept. Given this and the absence of windows or balconies, there are no transparent railing structures visible as would be expected in a building scene. Thus, the answer is No.",

      "question": "Are the windows on each floor arranged in a continuous, curved arc along the buildingâ€™s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is a complex alien-like creature with tentacles, not a building. Therefore, concepts like windows or building surfaces do not apply to this image. As such, there are no windows arranged in a curved arc as there would be if a building were depicted. Hence, the answer is No.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Can furniture items (such as chairs or tables) be seen inside the rooms through the windows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B features a fantastical alien creature with tentacle-like appendages, rather than any buildings or interior spaces, there are no rooms, windows, or furniture that can be seen or referred to. Consequently, applying this understanding, the notion of seeing furniture through windows is inapplicable, so the answer is No.",

      "question": "Is the building viewed from a low-angle side perspective, showing its height and curving profile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, which displays a sci-fi, tentacled creature, lacks any architectural elements such as buildings or facades that could be viewed from any angle or perspective. Therefore, evaluating the image for a low-angle view or curving profile of a building does not apply to this fictional subject. The answer is No.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no windows or balconies because the image shows an imaginative alien entity rather than a building or any architectural structure. Therefore, considering whether windows have corresponding balconies is irrelevant to the depicted image. Thus, the answer is No.",
