      "question": "Is the black drawer cabinet still present below the round mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a small black drawer cabinet with a round mirror above it. It appears to be a miniaturized or stylized version, possibly a figurine, but the key elements of a black drawer cabinet and a round mirror are present. This analysis is based on recognizing the visual characteristics of cabinets such as drawers and knobs. By common knowledge, drawers on a cabinet of this style suggest a similar functional object as in Image A, even if the image itself is stylized.",

      "question": "Does the image still feature a large round mirror above the drawer cabinet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a round mirror above the drawer cabinet just like in Image A. Although the mirror in Image B is smaller and stylized, it retains the key characteristic features - it is round and hangs above the cabinet. Recognizing circles and their common uses in decor help determine this is a mirror.",

      "question": "Is natural light still entering the room from the window on the left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include a window or indications of natural light sources like in Image A. It appears to be a close-up or diorama setup rather than a real room setting. Thus, the elements indicative of natural light or windows are absent.",

      "question": "Is there still a potted plant with long green leaves on the right side of the drawer cabinet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, on the left side next to the cabinet, there is a small stylized potted plant with green elements, but it does not match the long green leaves of a larger plant depicted in Image A. In Image A, the plant is much larger and positioned to the right of the cabinet.",

      "question": "Does the floor still have a light wood texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floor or supporting surface in Image B is not clearly visible as having a specific texture like wood. The focus is on the cabinet and mirror, and the setting looks more like a stylized or miniaturized scene. Without clear visuals indicating a wood texture, and based on common observation of miniatures, it's unlikely to have the detailed texture as seen in Image A's flooring.",
