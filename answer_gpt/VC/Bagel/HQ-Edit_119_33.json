      "question": "Is the subject's skin tone dark brown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is depicted as part of a stylized artwork with a focus on contours, patterns, and abstract representations rather than realistic human features. Thus, the subject's skin tone in this edited version is not explicitly conveyed as dark brown. The abstract nature of the art does not include realistic skin tone depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there at least one sunflower placed in the subject's hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized artwork represents floral elements as part of the pattern within the design, but these are not explicitly shown as being placed in the subject’s hair. The visual elements are abstract and generalized.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the subject wearing a yellow dress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the subject in an abstract pattern without conveying specific colors linked to clothing such as a yellow dress. The use of color in the stylization is more focused on creating patterns and does not specify the dress's color.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the subject's head turned slightly to her right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized depiction shows the subject’s head facing forward as part of an abstract design. There is no indication of head positioning such as turning to the right.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the subject standing within a sunflower field?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design includes floral motifs and patterns, however, it does not depict a realistic sunflower field setting as seen in Image A. The stylization maintains abstract and patterned visuals.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the light source coming from the upper right side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks the use of realistic lighting scenarios; instead, it features a collection of stylized patterns and shapes. Therefore, it does not articulate a specific light source as one might infer in a realistic depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the subject have a visible smile showing her teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is stylized abstractly without facial details such as smiles or teeth exposure due to the blurred face in both images and the artistic depiction. The design does not focus on facial expressions.",

      "model_answer": "No",
