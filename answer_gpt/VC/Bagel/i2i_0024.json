      "question": "Does the tennis player retain the pose with her right arm holding the racket and her left arm raised in a fist pump?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi keychain representation of the tennis player shows the figure standing with the racket being held parallel to the ground, but neither arm is in the position of a fist pump. The arms are not positioned to indicate a celebratory or dynamic action typical of a fist pump. This differs from a real-life representation that might show a tennis player engaging in active play or celebration.",

      "question": "Are the clay court lines present with a white outline to define the boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the clay court surface with a singular horizontal line depicted within a round circle, lacking the comprehensive boundary lines typical of an entire tennis court. In real-world tennis, a court has multiple boundary lines marked in white to delineate the different areas of the playing space. Image B simplifies this concept with minimal representation of court lines.",

      "question": "Does the tennis player wear an orange dress and a white visor, preserving their basic shapes and colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis player in the chibi keychain is illustrated wearing a dress and visor. However, the dress appears red rather than orange, and the visor is white, maintaining a basic visor shape but not replicating the exact color of an orange dress. This interpretation uses simplified color patterns typical of stylized or cartoon representations, differing from a real-life depiction.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tennis racket represented as a black-filled shape with minimal detailing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis racket is illustrated with a black outline filled with a flesh-toned grid inside the racket's head, adding a level of detail for a net pattern. However, this minimal detailing still simplifies the design compared to a real tennis racket, which would have intricate string patterns and colors. This stylized representation aligns with the simplified portrayal common in chibi or cartoon art forms.",

      "question": "Does the player exhibit a tennis-related gesture (specifically, the fist pump)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character representation of the player does not depict any overt gestures typical of tennis play such as a fist pump, which is an expressive movement indicating victory or excitement. Here, the figure holds the racket in a non-dynamic, neutral position that doesnâ€™t imply any active playing or celebratory gestures.",
