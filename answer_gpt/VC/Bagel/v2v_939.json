      "question": "Is the drainpipe releasing water onto the ground visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drainpipe is clearly visible, releasing water onto the ground. This conclusion comes from observing the water flow that is exiting the pipe and cascading onto the surface below, which is visually apparent. The understanding relies on the recognition of the shape and function of the drainpipe as depicted.",

      "question": "Are the orange wall and brown door present in the background of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features both an orange wall and a brown door which can be observed behind the chibi character. This is inferred from the visual cues such as the color and rectangular shape of the objects typically found in architectural settings.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question": "Does the chibi character wear a green raincoat and green boots in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B is wearing a green raincoat and green boots. This is a straightforward observation based on the color of the attire, matching typical characteristics of rainwear designed to stand out and be waterproof.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the chibi character positioned in front of the wall and drainpipe in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B places the chibi character in front of both the wall and the drainpipe, as indicated by the visual depth where the character is overlapping these elements. The position can be deduced from the layering of the objects in the scene.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground appears to be flat and smooth rather than textured like cobblestones. This conclusion comes from observing the surface where the water lands, which lacks distinctive textures or patterns usually associated with cobblestones.",
