    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the alternating pattern of light and dark squares on the chessboard preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of a chessboard, there is a fantasy scene with ethereal figures and fire, indicative of an artistic creation or 3D rendering. The visual cues from Image B do not show a chessboard pattern of alternating light and dark squares, as it has entirely different elements. Therefore, the visual information suggests that the alternating pattern is not preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the king located in the central position of the visible row of black pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figures do not represent any traditional chess pieces, specifically the king. The figure at the center resembles an ethereal being from a fictional or mythical setting, unlike a chess piece like the king. Given the absence of chess pieces in Image B, the king is not located in any central position as described.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there exactly two bishops, two knights, and at least four pawns visible in their original positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B consists of fantastical figures and flames instead of chess pieces in traditional positions. There are no bishops, knights, or pawns present as chess pieces are not visually observed. Therefore, the conditions described in the question are not met.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the shadows of the chess pieces extend diagonally toward the bottom-left of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any chess pieces, hence no shadows are projected from traditional chess pieces. The visual elements include fiery and mystical figures, not casting traditional shadows characteristic of a chess setup.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wood grain texture of the chessboard surface visible across the light squares?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a forest-like ground with creatures, devoid of a chessboard or any wood grain texture associated with it. The visual evidence is centered on the artistic depiction of a mystical scene, so the wood grain texture is not present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a blurred background with horizontal structural lines visible behind the chessboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background showcases a forest environment with soft focus, contrasting with the foreground characters, without any structural lines typical of a blurred chessboard setting. Therefore, the described background elements differ completely from Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there exactly eight black chess pieces visible in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts ethereal and mystical figures rather than chess pieces. It includes numerous figures of varying sizes and styles, none of which are identifiable as black chess pieces from a traditional set. The image does not conform to the count of eight black chess pieces.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the background of the image blurred while the foreground pieces are in sharp focus?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the forest background is depicted with a soft blur, while the foreground fantastical figures appear in sharp focus. This characteristic is consistent with artistic renditions where focus is used to highlight significant elements. Therefore, Image B's visual setting supports this observation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
