    "Question": "Q1: Is the figure in the top-right corner still shown with its right arm raised high, holding a weapon aloft?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the objects are plush fish toys, none of which have arms or hold weapons. A plush fish's design hardly resembles the original horned figure. The figure in the original Image A, a horned minotaur-like character, holds a weapon aloft with its right arm. The conversion of figures to plush fish inherently removes such attributes. Therefore, there are no raised arms or weapons in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the figure in the bottom-left corner still show a hand gripping a curved blade in its right hand?",
    "explanation": "Image B consists of plush fish toys, which do not possess hands to grip a blade. Originally, Image A featured a figure with a curved blade in the right hand. Replacing these warriors with plush fish, by design, involves removing attributes like hands or weapons. Thus, the plush fish cannot perform the action described in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the figure in the bottom-left corner still in a kneeling position with one knee on the ground and the other leg bent forward?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subjects are plush fish toys, incapable of assuming a kneeling position, inherently lacking limbs for articulation. Image A had a figure in a kneeling pose based on the typical action figure stance depicted. Plush toys have a static, rounded form and do not replicate the dynamic pose of the original figure.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the figure in the top-left corner still face slightly to the left with its head turned toward the viewer?",
    "explanation": "It is difficult to discern because Image B shows fish toys which do not express the head or body orientation typical of humanoid figures. The original Image A's figure had a distinct orientation facing left with a head turn to add expressive character. Plush toys often lack such detailed orientation due to their design and purpose.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the figure in the bottom-right corner still hold a long, vertical weapon in its right hand?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are plush fish toys, and none appear capable of holding weapons. In Image A, the bottom-right figure held a long weapon in its right hand, which is characteristic of an action figure. However, the transition to a plush form means removing such distinct features.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the left leg of the top-right figure still bent backward, supporting a forward lunge?",
    "explanation": "Image B features plush fish, which do not possess legs or demonstrate mobility or posture like action figures. The original Image A shows the figure in a dynamic pose with the left leg bent backward to support motion. Plush toys, however, do not allow for such specific positioning.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is there a skull-shaped pendant visible around the neck of the bottom-right figure?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not portray any figures with a recognizable neck or neck adornment, given the plush fish theme, which replaces those humanoid features. Image A's original sceneb included human-like action figures equipped with accessories like a skull-shaped pendant around the neck. Plush fish designs typically lack such detailed accessory features.",
    "answer": "No"
