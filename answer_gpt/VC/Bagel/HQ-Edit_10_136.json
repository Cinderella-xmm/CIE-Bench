        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl is holding a guitar, which appears complete with a sound hole and fretboard as typical for acoustic guitars. The visual depiction in cartoons often retains essential elements for recognition despite simplicity.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],

        "No"
      ],
