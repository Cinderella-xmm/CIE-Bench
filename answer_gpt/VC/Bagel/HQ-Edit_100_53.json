        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized art shows branches and cherry blossoms; however, the depiction is more abstract without indicating a dense bloom or canopy, fitting more into artistic simplification rather than a realistic crowded blossom depiction.",
