    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the floral and foliate engraved patterns visible on the body of the transformed owl, arranged symmetrically between vertical ribs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl is depicted with intricate designs on its body, resembling mechanical and geometric motifs rather than floral or foliate patterns. These designs do not appear to be arranged symmetrically between vertical ribs, which is a characteristic of the original teapot in Image A. The original teapot features ornate floral engravings placed symmetrically along vertical ribs, but the owl presents a more steampunk-inspired design with a focus on gears and metallic elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the transformed owl retain a shiny, polished metallic surface consistent with the original teapot’s finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed owl clearly possesses a polished metallic surface, which is a key feature of the original teapot in Image A. This shiny, metallic aesthetic is consistent throughout both images, making the owl appear to have the same type of finish, showcasing a reflective and smooth metallic texture similar to the teapot.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the beak of the mechanical owl shaped like the original teapot’s curved spout, extending forward and slightly upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The beak of the mechanical owl in Image B is designed to resemble a pointed structure but does not clearly extend forward and slightly upward in the same manner as the original teapot’s curved spout in Image A. The spout of the teapot has a distinct curvature that is not mirrored in the owl's design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the tail of the mechanical owl follow the same graceful C-shaped curve as the original teapot’s handle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tail of the mechanical owl in Image B does not exhibit the same C-shaped curve as the teapot’s handle in Image A. The owl’s tail appears to be more straightforward and lacking the elegant curvature of the original handle.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the crown-like head of the mechanical owl include a pointed, tiered finial matching the original teapot’s lid top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl features feather-like structures for its crown rather than a pointed, tiered finial. The original teapot in Image A has a finial on its lid, which is distinctively tiered and pointed. This structural element is not replicated in the owl's design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the body segments of the mechanical owl divided into vertical ribs, each housing a decorative motif, mirroring the original teapot’s structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the mechanical owl with body segments that appear to have more elaborate mechanical designs rather than being divided into vertical ribs with decorative motifs. On the other hand, Image A features the teapot’s body with distinctive vertical ribs housing symmetrical decorative motifs. The segmentation style is fundamentally different between the two.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the ornamental scrollwork present at the base of the mechanical owl’s tail, corresponding to the original handle’s end?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image of the owl does not display any ornamental scrollwork at the base of its tail that corresponds to the teapot handle’s end, which in Image A features detailed scrollwork. The owl’s tail is more simplified and unornamented.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the tail of the mechanical owl rendered in a dark brown tone consistent with the original handle’s color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mechanical owl’s tail in Image B is not rendered in a dark brown tone. It features a more metallic color palette that matches the overall aesthetic of the owl, unlike the wooden dark brown hue of the original teapot’s handle in Image A.",
