      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seated individual holds the cake with one hand. Observing the visual cues, the left hand is visible supporting the cake from underneath. Based on common cake-holding practices and the position of the hand, this is typically done with one hand to facilitate an easy grip from the bottom, especially when balancing an object like a cake that has weight and needs stability.",
