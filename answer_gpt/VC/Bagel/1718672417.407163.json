      "question": "Are the ears upright and positioned symmetrically on top of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ears are clearly visible and are positioned upright, pointing upwards. They are also symmetrically placed at the top of the head, which is a typical arrangement for many animals featuring such characteristics. The visibility and position confirm their symmetry and upright stance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the dark-framed glasses positioned directly over the eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible dark-framed glasses over the eyes. The absence of such glasses is evident when examining the area around the blurred face and the top of the head, where one would typically expect to see glasses.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a red patterned bandana wrapped around the forehead, above the glasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any red patterned bandana around the forehead area, nor are there any glasses present over which a bandana would be wrapped. This absence confirms that such an accessory is not visible in the image.",

    {

      "question": "Is the white fur texture visible on the head and upper neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible white fur texture that appears around the neck and upper part of the body. This fur texture suggests a soft and fluffy appearance, often associated with animals or costumes designed to resemble them.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question": "Do the braids extend downward from the neck area and appear to be made from the subjectâ€™s own fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the braids are clearly extending downward from the region of the neck. However, they resemble extensions or decorations rather than natural fur due to their distinct design and appearance. Therefore, they do not appear to originate from the subject's own fur.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the head turned slightly to the left, with the gaze facing forward toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the head oriented such that it does not appear to be turned to the left. The position and alignment suggest that the gaze is directed forward, but the orientation is straightforward rather than indicating a turn specifically to the left.",
