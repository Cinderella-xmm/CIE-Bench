    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the sandwich cross-section with layered ingredients clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandwich is depicted in a cartoon style where distinct layers of ingredients such as lettuce and other fillings are visible. The cartoon effect simplifies them but still makes them discernible, which is often the approach in stylized illustrations. Thus, the sandwich cross-section is visible but in a stylized manner.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the sandwich bread retain its golden-brown crust appearance despite the cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although Image B is stylized into a cartoon, the representation of the sandwich bread includes shades of browns typically used to symbolize a golden-brown crust. Colors in cartoons are often exaggerated to maintain recognizable features while adapting them into simpler forms.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sandwich remain on the white, rectangular plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized representation shows the sandwich atop a surface resembling a white, rectangular shape which is an abstract depiction of a plate. This indicates the intention to retain the sandwich on a plate in the cartoon rendition.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the background still depict a wooden table surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B represents a wooden surface using an orange color which simulates the wooden texture. The simplified cartoon rendering opts for a solid color while preserving the concept of a wooden table as discerned from the original image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sandwich positioned centrally on the plate as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandwich is depicted closer to the edge of the plate rather than centrally, contrasting with the original image where it is more centrally placed. This shift may be due to stylistic choices in the cartoon rendering.",
