    "Question": "Q1: Is the mountain depicted as a symmetrical, perfectly conical shape with a pointed peak?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain is depicted in a stylized, almost whimsical manner. It doesn't maintain the natural symmetrical conical shape seen in real mountains. Instead, the peak is more rounded and embellished with artistic snow-like features that don't contribute to a perfectly conical appearance. This artistic depiction takes creative liberties, deviating from a traditional conical mountain peak.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Does the summit of the mountain have a continuous white snow cap covering the top?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain is topped with an artistic layer resembling snow, but it isn't uniform or continuous as in natural settings. The depiction includes exaggerated, decorative snow patterns rather than a continuous cap, indicating an artistic rather than realistic portrayal.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Is there a clear, mirror-like reflection of the mountain in the lake below?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, rather than a lake, there is an abstract colorful base resembling water, but it doesn't produce a clear, mirror-like reflection of the mountain. The stylized depiction includes creative elements rather than realistic reflections.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there small structures or buildings positioned along the edge of the lake, between the water and the mountain base?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are small, house-like structures depicted in front of the mountain, with creative, non-realistic styling. These are positioned similarly to how structures might be placed near a body of water, yet the context lacks the actual presence of a natural lake and rather uses artistic liberty.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the sky visible above the mountain, appearing as a solid or gradient blue area?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sky above the mountain is indeed visible, depicted in a solid, deep blue with some artistic cloud features. This retains a somewhat realistic vision of a sky, although stylized in overall context.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there visible layers on the mountainâ€™s slopes, showing a transition from white snow at the top to darker rock and then to green/brown vegetation below?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain lacks the natural transition of layers from snow to rock and then vegetation. Instead, it features a very abstract, artistic portrayal of snow patterns and lacks the necessary detailing to show a gradual, realistic transition into other natural layers like rock or vegetation.",
    "answer": "No"
