      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is depicted with her left leg lifted and bent at the knee while her right foot is indeed planted on the ground. This is a common portrayal of a dancing pose indicating motion, which can be inferred even without comparing to Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is clearly positioned on the right side of the image and her posture and arm direction indicate that she is facing toward the left side of the frame. This orientation is evident from the spatial arrangement and the way the dancer's body is facing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the skirt of the dancer appear to be flared outward and upward due to motion, suggesting a spinning or leaping movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skirt in Image B is depicted as moving outward and upwards, which is a typical indication of motion such as spinning or leaping. The outward flare suggests dynamic movement, commonly associated with dance.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition shows the dancer prominently in the foreground, with animals visible in the midground and trees placed further back in the background. This layering of elements is a typical way of composing scenes to create depth.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting effect shows that the light source is coming from the right side. This can be inferred from the way highlights and shadows are depicted on the dancerâ€™s costume and body, suggesting illumination from the right.",
