      "question": "Does the edited image retain the figure's iconic screaming posture and facial expression, including the wide-open mouth and hands on ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's posture—with hands on ears and a noticeable wide-open mouth—is retained. This posture is iconic as it represents the expression of shock and horror in the painting 'The Scream'. The visual here similarly highlights this aspect, allowing the recognition of its iconic posture and expression.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the figure still wearing the blue garment and has the same pale face as in the original painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B continues to wear the blue garment consistent with its depiction in the original painting. The garment maintains the swirling lines and blue color akin to 'The Scream's character. The pale face, although originally blurred, complements the continuity of this feature from the original artwork.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the figure positioned on what appears to be the edge of a bridge or platform, similar to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting has changed to display a war-like background with explosions and soldiers, in contrast to the original setting, which shows a bridge scene. This substantial alteration indicates that the figure is no longer on an edge similar to Image A’s platform or bridge setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the figure's limbs and body still depicted using distorted, swirling lines to convey the sense of anxiety and fear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the depiction of the figure’s body using distorted, swirling lines. These lines are a characteristic style in ‘The Scream’, used to express the psychological impact of anxiety and fear, which are preserved in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the expressive, swirled brushstroke style characteristic of the original painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the figure retains the swirling artistic style in its clothing, the background is replaced by realistic war imagery, losing the painting's expressive brushstroke style that characterized the environment in ‘The Scream’. Therefore, the retained style applies mainly to the figure itself, not the entire image.",
