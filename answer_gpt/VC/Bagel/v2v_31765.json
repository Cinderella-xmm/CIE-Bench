      "question": "Is the pile of diced vegetables on the left side of the image orange in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leftmost pile of diced vegetables appears yellow rather than orange. This is determined by observing the color of the vegetable pieces. Typically, diced carrots are orange in color, but in this image, the vegetables are depicted with a bright yellow hue, deviating from the common orange color associated with carrots.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the green vegetable pieces in the center of the image have a curved, C-shaped form with a visible hollow center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central green vegetable pieces are designed with a curved and C-shaped appearance and a hollow center is visible. This observation aligns with the characteristics of celery, which generally has a C-shape when chopped. Thus, the edit maintains the expected structure of celery.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the diced vegetables on the right side of the image pale white or translucent in appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vegetables in the right pile appear as pale white or slightly bluish rather than translucent when compared to typical onions. The color representation is more solid with a stylized appearance rather than realistic, giving a distinct coloring rather than a true translucent onion color.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a knife with a metallic blade and black handle located in the upper right portion of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knife is located in the upper right portion of the image and has a prominent blue blade with a rather stylized and solid color. The handle appears to be a dark color but retrofitted to match the abstract and colorful style, which deviates from the metallic appearance of a typical knife blade.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the surface beneath the vegetables and knife a wooden cutting board with visible horizontal grain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface under the knife and vegetables does not resemble a wooden cutting board. Instead, it is a colorful abstract pattern that is different from the natural wood grain typically seen. The vibrant and geometric design lacks the characteristic horizontal grain of wood.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the three piles of vegetables arranged in a triangular pattern with carrots on the left, celery in the middle, and onions on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the three piles of vegetables are arranged linearly from left to right rather than in a triangular pattern. This is clearly depicted as they progress horizontally across the image. The sequence from left to right is yellow diced vegetables, followed by green and then white, aligning similarly to Image A, but linear in layout.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the knife placed diagonally across the upper right area of the image, adjacent to the pile of onions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knife is visually located in the upper right area of the image, positioned diagonally adjacent to the pile of white vegetables on the right. The knife's angle and placement align with being next to this pile, correctly demonstrating its diagonal alignment adjacent to what can be inferred as the onions.",
