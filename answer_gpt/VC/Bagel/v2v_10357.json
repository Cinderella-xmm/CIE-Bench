      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teddy bear continues wearing a white helmet and a blue cape, as indicated by the helmet's distinct white color and the cape's vibrant blue hue.

      "question": "Is the teddy bear still golden-brown with black button eyes and a brown nose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the teddy bear in a stylized, polygonal or faceted design, resulting in a difference in texture and appearance. The bear is now orange rather than golden-brown, and its facial features resemble cartoon-like dots, without the appearance of distinct button eyes and a brown nose. This suggests a transformation from a real-world teddy bear design to a more abstract, artistic representation.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The motorcycle in Image B maintains its essential features, such as the round headlight, two wheels, and handlebars, reflecting a recognizable motorcycle design. Despite the change in artistic style, these fundamental components are present, allowing for a typical motorcycle structure to be perceived.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teddy bear is positioned seating on the motorcycle similar to Image A. It conforms to a typical riding posture with arms extended to hold the handlebars, indicating a continuation of the original pose despite the shift to a polygonal design.",
