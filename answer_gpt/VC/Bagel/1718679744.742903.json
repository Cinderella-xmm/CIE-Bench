      "question": "Is the crocodile's snout with two visible teeth present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area representing the crocodile's snout showcases a simplistic representation with a cartoon-like style, lacking detailed textures or features. It does not explicitly depict visible teeth, making it more stylized and abstract compared to realistic imagery. The presence of teeth is not apparent due to the line art style and simplification of the crocodile's features.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, it depicts a colorful hat with a pom-pom on top of a cartoon-styled crocodile, closely resembling the shape and style of a knitted hat similar to Image A.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crocodile is depicted with sunglasses styled in bright colors, mirroring the orange frame seen in Image A. Due to the simplified graphical design, the reflective property of the lenses may be interpreted as present by the bold stylized colors, maintaining the resemblance to the original accessory placement.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the cartoon crocodile facing forward with no apparent orientation change or tilt, maintaining a direct forward facing position. The leftward turn seen in Image A is not reflected in the depiction, which instead retains a straightforward alignment typical of simplified illustrations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon representation of the crocodile does not include elements indicating a water environment or submersion. The focus on black and white line art capturing only the creature's likeness results in a lack thereof any liquid context that might suggest partial immersion.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon viewing Image B, the sunglasses lack the detailed reflective effect seen in Image A, opting for a graphic design with a solid color scheme. While the lenses are multicolored, they don't convey reflective surfaces, focusing instead on illustrating a vibrant rather than realistic depiction.",
