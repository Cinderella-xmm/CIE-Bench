        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl appears to be leaning against the railing, with one foot touching the skateboard, suggesting she is interacting with it. The position of her foot and the way she is standing imply a casual and engaging interaction with the skateboard, which is commonly seen when someone is preparing to skate or adjusting their stance on the board.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is depicted standing next to the girl, looking down at the skateboard. His posture, leaning towards the girl and the skateboard while resting his arm on the railing, implies a level of interaction, possibly offering guidance or evaluating the setup, which is consistent with a situation where teaching or observing is involved.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the girl and the man are shown next to each other, with the railing visible behind them. The man's arm is resting on the railing, suggesting they are leaning against it, a casual posture indicative of a relaxed environment as seen in social or learning scenarios.",
