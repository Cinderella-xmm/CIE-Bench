    "Question": "Q1: Is the train represented in a red-and-gray color block scheme?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the train is depicted using a simplified color block scheme, where large geometric shapes are used to suggest the form and colors of the objects. The train features clearly visible red blocks, with portions depicted in a gray or dark color, which corresponds to a red-and-gray color scheme. This abstraction is common in art styles that focus on color blocking, suggesting these colors in an abstract way.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Is the sign circular with the text 'STOP' clearly displayed?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sign is depicted using an abstract style, but it maintains a geometric shape that closely resembles an octagon rather than a circle. The word 'STOP' is prominently displayed within this shape, similar to a traditional stop sign, which is octagonal. In traffic signage design, a stop sign is typically octagonal with the word 'STOP' clearly displayed. Therefore, based on common knowledge of sign shapes and a visual assessment, the sign is not circular.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the train positioned parallel to the tracks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the train is simplified into a two-dimensional side profile, depicted with straight lines representing the train and the track in parallel alignment. The linear design implies that the train moves alongside the tracks, following their direction. This parallel orientation between tracks and train is consistent with normal train operation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there green mountain outlines in the background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, an abstract representation of mountains is evident in the background, characterized by the use of solid green color to suggest the simplified shape of mountain forms. The use of outline-like depiction in a singular green hue suggests mountains in a minimalistic style that are typical in abstract graphic renditions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are simplified track lines present beneath the train?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the track area under the train is depicted with long, straight parallel lines that represent the guides for the train's wheels. Though simplified, these lines visually suggest simplified railway tracks underneath the train. Such depiction is common in graphic illustrations focusing on defining essential elements with minimal detail.",
    "answer": "Yes"
