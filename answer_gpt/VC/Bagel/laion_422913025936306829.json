      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure is standing upright rather than bending forward. The figure's posture is more elongated and standing tall compared to a bent-forward pose. Therefore, the visual cue shows an upright position rather than a bent-forward one.",
