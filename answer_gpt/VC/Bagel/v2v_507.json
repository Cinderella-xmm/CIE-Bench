      "question": "Does the chibi character retain the pink color scheme of the original phone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original phone in the image has a pink color scheme. When observing the chibi character, the most prominent color in its attire is a reddish-brown hoodie, which doesn't strictly match the pink color scheme. Instead, it appears to use a more neutral palette for the clothing and overall appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the chibi character incorporate the dual-camera setup from the original phone in its design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original phone features a dual-camera setup visible on its back. In analyzing the chibi character, there is no visible representation or design element that suggests the incorporation of a dual-camera setup. The focus of the chibi design is more oriented toward technology themes, like holding a laptop, without specific reference to phone features.",

      "question": "Does the chibi character's outfit and accessories reflect the sleek and modern design aesthetic of the original phone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original phone has a sleek, modern design with minimalist features. The chibi character's outfit, consisting of a hoodie and sneakers, aims to convey a tech-savvy persona rather than mirroring the phone's aesthetic directly. While it reflects a modern casual style, it doesn’t precisely match the aesthetic of the phone.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the chibi character have elongated legs as specified, while maintaining a balance with the phone's design elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the chibi character, the design is typical of chibi art style with proportionate, short limbs relative to the head size, which is characteristic of the style. This doesn’t align with the concept of elongated legs nor directly correlates with the phone's design elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the solid background color chosen to complement the pink color scheme of the original phone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of the edited chibi character image is a neutral beige, which does not naturally complement the original phone’s pink color scheme. The choice of background color suggests neutrality and simplicity, making the design of the character stand out without direct coordination with the phone color.",
