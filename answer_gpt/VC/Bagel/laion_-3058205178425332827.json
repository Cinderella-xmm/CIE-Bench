      "question": "Is the bell tower with a domed roof and two arched windows clearly visible and structurally intact in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the central character is a cartoonish cat wearing a striped shirt and beret, and the background is an artistic rendition of buildings by the sea. There is no bell tower with a domed roof and two arched windows visible in this image. The edited image contains stylized and simplified versions of architectural elements, possibly inspired by coastal Mediterranean or Italian towns, but no clear bell tower structure is present as described.",

      "question": "Is the large, dark mountain with a distinct peak visible in the background behind the city?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the background consists of a simplified, cartoonish seaside town with rolling hills. There is no large, dark mountain with a distinct peak behind the city as described. Instead, the hills are more gently sloped and feature clean, pastel colors to fit the overall whimsical style of the illustration.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the presence of the seaside is indicated, and there are simplified representations of buildings alongside the water, but docks and harbor structures are not clearly detailed or distinctly visible in the edited image. The scene is more focused on simplified shapes and colors rather than specific structural details like docks or harbors.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the rooftops of the buildings in the foreground are represented with warm colors similar to reddish-brown tones, matching the description. The rooftops are vibrant and clearly colored in a manner similar to Mediterranean tiles.",

      "question": "Does the sky retain a dominant pink and purple gradient transitioning toward the horizon, with blue tones over the sea?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the sky does feature a dominant pink gradient transitioning towards the horizon, although it appears in a more simplified, cartoon-like form. The sea is depicted with blue tones. Overall, the color scheme aligns with the described pink and purple gradients transitioning toward the horizon.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the city positioned between the foreground rooftops and the distant mountain, with the sea to the right side of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the city is depicted as being along the coast, but the configuration is more abstract and stylized. There are hills in the background rather than a distinct distant mountain. The sea is to the right of the scene. However, the spatial relationship is more symbolic and not as precise as in a realistic landscape painting.",
