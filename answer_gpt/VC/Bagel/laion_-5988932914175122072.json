      "question": "Is the circular gold-tone MK logo charm present and clearly visible on the model’s attire or accessories?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a distinct circular gold-tone MK logo charm that is visible on the lower part of the model’s dress. This resembles the MK charm seen dangling from the bag in Image A. The presence of such a logo on fashion items like a dress is consistent with branding practices to emphasize designer affiliation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the \"MICHAEL KORS\" brand name visible in gold uppercase letters near the upper right area of the model’s attire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The model’s dress in Image B has been designed to resemble features of the Michael Kors bag, yet amidst observation, the 'MICHAEL KORS' brand name, typically found on the bag in Image A, does not appear on the dress itself. Given this design choice, it suggests an emphasis on the logo rather than the brand name text.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the model’s dress feature a black pebbled texture resembling the original bag’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dress worn by the model in Image B has a surface texture that visually mimics the black pebbled leather seen in the bag from Image A. This textural mimicry suggests a deliberate attempt to integrate the aesthetic elements of the handbag design into the fashion garment.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are gold-tone hardware elements (such as buckles, zippers, or clasps) visibly incorporated into the model’s accessories or outfit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The model in Image B appears in a dress with visible gold-tone elements that mirror the gold hardware seen on the Michael Kors bag in Image A. The incorporation of such elements in fashion is commonly used to create harmony between different accessories and the overall outfit.",

      "question": "Is a zippered pocket with a gold-tone pull visible on the side of the model’s dress or outfit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, a zippered feature similar to the one found on the original handbag in Image A is not present on the model’s dress. The dress instead focuses on replicating the texture and the structural design of the bag.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The model’s posture or arm alignment in Image B does not mimic the curved handles seen in Image A from the Michael Kors bag. The dress design and the model’s styling focus more on texture and logos rather than incorporating or reflecting the handbag’s handle structure into posture.",
