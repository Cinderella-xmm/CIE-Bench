      "question": "Is the distinctive golden lattice framework of the Address Downtown tower visible and structurally intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a futuristic scene with a large robotic figure and illuminated structures, which do not resemble traditional architecture. The Address Downtown tower with its golden lattice framework is not visible in the edited scene, instead, futuristic elements dominate the skyline. Considering the transformation in the scene, the original structure is not preserved and thus not intact.",

      "question": "Is the cylindrical shape and curved top of the Emaar Tower preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skyline and buildings have been transformed into a futuristic and robotic environment. There is no visible evidence of traditional tower shapes like the cylindrical Emaar Tower with a curved top. The transformation has altered the architectural elements to futuristic motifs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the Address Downtown tower located to the left of the Emaar Tower in the skyline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature traditional towers or buildings in their original form as visible in Image A. Instead, it shows a futuristic setting dominated by a robotic figure and high-tech structures. The relocation and transformation of these elements do not provide any clear indication of the relative positioning of Address Downtown tower and Emaar Tower.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B replaces the traditional urban landscape with futuristic highways and robotic elements, eliminating the presence of low-rise buildings with specific architectural details like arched windows seen in Image A. Therefore, these buildings are absent from Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image (B) depicts an entirely different futuristic environment with technological and robotic elements taking over the scene. There is no large building with a green roof or any features resembling traditional illuminated frontage visible anymore in this altered scene.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky remains dark in conformity with a nighttime setting but is supplemented with futuristic aesthetics such as high-tech elements and robot-like figures. However, the specific uniform dark blue with no visible clouds or stars is not prominent as altered visual features dominate the skyline.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B reconstructs the skyline into one dominated by advanced technology and robotics, camouflaging any traditional skyscrapers such as the tapering one with a glowing crown from Image A. This transition disembodies previous architectural forms for more futuristic imagery.",
