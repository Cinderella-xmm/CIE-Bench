      "question": "Are both feet positioned en pointe, with the right foot slightly ahead of the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the edited image, the figure is a statue with feet clearly positioned on the ground, not in ballet en pointe position. The statue is depicted with its right foot forward, but it doesn't meet the criteria for 'en pointe' as it's not a ballet dancer. World knowledge about ballet is applied to ascertain that only dancers execute en pointe positions professionally.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both arms extended laterally from the body, with palms facing inward and fingers gently curved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts a statue with one arm extending outward while the other is positioned differently. The hands are not presented in a ballet position typical for dancers, and use world knowledge to conclude that statues often have arms and hands positioned in specific artistic compositions to convey different meanings.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the head turned to the left, with the chin slightly raised?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In examining the edited image, we find the statue's head turned to the side, but not specifically to the left as requested by the question. Combining visual cues and world knowledge regarding art styles and human posture, the statueâ€™s position does not illustrate the specific movement of turning the head left with a chin raise.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the legs fully extended and aligned vertically, with the spine slightly arched backward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "World knowledge about ballet and human anatomy informs us that dancers typically achieve vertical alignment and arching through specific poses. Observing the statue, its legs aren't fully extended vertically, nor does it depict an arched spine reflecting ballet principles.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the arms positioned at approximately hip level, extending outward from the sides of the torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the statue presents one arm at a different level than hip position, with its hands in a position typical for statues. World knowledge about human positioning helps conclude that the arms aren't in the requested lateral extension at hip level.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the upper body slightly tilted forward while maintaining vertical alignment through the spine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the statue's posture, its upper body does not exhibit a forward tilt. Statues often have a fixed posture with different artistic angles, and here, the body appears aligned without the forward inclination characteristic of performing dancers or models.",
