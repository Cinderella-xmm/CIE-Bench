      "question": "Is the Great Wall depicted as a continuous, zigzagging structure following the contours of the mountain ridges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Great Wall is depicted inside a snow globe. It is displayed as a miniature, zigzagging structure. This portrayal aligns with how the real Great Wall follows the contours of the mountains. The visual cues show the wall curving and changing directions similar to the real Great Wall. However, the context of Image B being a snow globe makes it more artistic and stylized.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the walls constructed with visible gray stone bricks and topped with crenellated battlements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Great Wall inside the snow globe appears to have bricks and crenellated battlements. However, due to the miniature and artistic nature of the snow globe design, colors and details might be less realistic. The stone bricks aren't visibly gray; they appear brownish, and while crenellation is suggested, it's not detailed.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there watchtowers visible at regular intervals along the wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe depiction of the Great Wall shows small structures resembling watchtowers on the wall, but not at regular intervals. Since these are miniatures, the representation is simplified and doesn't match the dense distribution of watchtowers in the real wall.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the trees surrounding the wall display bright autumn colors, including yellow, orange, and red foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are trees with orange and possibly yellow foliage surrounding the wall within the snow globe. This suggests an autumn theme though it is simplified due to the artistic depiction in a snow globe.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a large, rounded rock formation embedded near the right side of the wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, being a snow globe representation, there is no significant large rounded rock formation depicted like in a real setting. It mimics an artistic take on the Great Wall without specific large geological features.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Are multiple small figures visible walking along the wall, with some ascending stairs and others standing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are miniature figures walking along the Great Wall, depicted in the snow globe. They appear to be in an animated pose, suggestive of motion along a pathway, although the details such as ascending stairs aren't explicitly shown due to the small scale.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there visible stone steps leading upward along the wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, representing the Great Wall inside a snow globe, the tiny scale makes it difficult to establish the clear presence of stone steps. The depiction is more abstract and whimsical rather than showing detailed structures like stone stairways.",
