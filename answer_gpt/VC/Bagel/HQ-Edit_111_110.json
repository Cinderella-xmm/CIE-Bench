      "question": "Is the key-shaped symbol with swirling arms and central knob present on the leftmost book of the bottom shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, observe the bottom shelf. The leftmost book does not feature a key-shaped symbol with swirling arms and a central knob, as there is no prominent or identifiable symbol resembling this description on any book spine. Observation relies on the visual confirmation of such a symbol's presence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the spiral motif clearly visible on the central book of the bottom shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the central book on the bottom shelf does not visibly feature a prominent spiral motif. Careful examination of the book spines reveals that no spiral-like designs are instantly recognizable, taking into account the clarity necessary for such features to be considered 'clearly visible.'",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the flowing vine-like pattern present on the rightmost book of the bottom shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the rightmost book on the bottom shelf does not exhibit a flowing vine-like pattern. Searching for flowing and organic shapes akin to vines in the design details of the book spines yields no match, which would be required to affirm the presence of such a pattern.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the interlacing Celtic knotwork patterns present on the top panel and vertical side frames of the bookshelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top panel and vertical side frames of the bookshelf indeed showcase intricate and interlacing patterns characteristic of Celtic knotwork. These designs are recognizable by their elaborate and intertwining style, aligning with typical Celtic design motifs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the three large books with detailed carvings positioned side by side on the bottom shelf, from left to right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom shelf displays no clear arrangement of three large books with detailed carvings side by side. The bookshelf lacks a distinct and focused set of such books grouped closely together, which would be required for factual confirmation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there at least four books with visible carved spines distributed across the middle and upper shelves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Referring to Image B, several carved spines are visible across the middle and upper shelves. Identifying these decreases reliance on counted observation; however, distributed presence across these shelves does indicate multiple carved book spines feature prominently.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, it is evident that the books and bookshelf components are crafted with various earthy hues including shades of brown, tan, and hints of muted red. These tones contribute to a natural and grounded aesthetic of the image.",
