    "Question": "Q1: Does the lion’s silhouette retain the distinct, wide, rounded mane shape around its head and neck?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a silhouetted shape representing a lion. A lion's mane is typically wide and rounded, forming a distinctive shape around its head and neck. The silhouette in Image B appears to have this characteristic rounded shape, typical of a lion's mane in a side view profile. This is derived from the common understanding of a lion's mane as viewed in both artistic and realistic depictions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the lion depicted with its front legs forward and rear legs bent, maintaining a poised, dominant stance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette of the lion features a shape suggestive of one leg being positioned forward and another back, which can imply a stance where the lion is poised and appearing to be in motion or readiness. This posture is often associated with a dominant or regal stance in animal imagery, drawing from typical art depictions of lions in such poses.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the lion’s head turned slightly toward the viewer, rather than fully in profile?",
    "explanation": "The silhouette shape in Image B suggests that the lion is predominantly shown in profile due to the simplified outline. In silhouette art, fully turned heads are rare because they obscure the recognizable features of the face. Therefore, the inference, based on the silhouette's appearance, suggests that the lion's head is oriented in profile.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is there grass present in the foreground beneath the lion?",
    "explanation": "Image B illustrates a black silhouette on a color gradient with the ground area and trees. There is no distinguishable grass feature depicted in the silhouette foreground beneath what is supposed to represent the lion. Silhouettes simplify and minimize detailed elements like individual grass strands.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are acacia trees visible in the background, either as natural forms or stylized silhouettes?",
    "explanation": "Acacia trees are identifiable by their distinctive flat-top canopies. In Image B, there are stylized tree shapes that match this signature profile. These are placed in the background, completing the scene typically associated with African savannas, and are recognized by their unique silhouette.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the lion positioned in the foreground, centered and large in scale relative to the background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette of the lion occupies a central and dominating part of the image, asserting its importance and presence in the composition. This scale and position relative to the minimal background elements like trees is typical in pictorial representations where the main subject is highlighted in the foreground.",
    "answer": "Yes"
