        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is portrayed with white hair, indicating age, commonly recognized as elderly characteristics. However, the image does not show a full white beard; it only displays white hair. This conclusion is reached by observing the hair and considering cultural depictions of elderly people.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows the man standing with his right hand holding a golden staff or object. His left hand is depicted as being tucked into the pocket of his coat, indicating a relaxed posture, supported by visual cues of his attire and hand positioning.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's attire consists of a pink overcoat, under which he wears a sweater vest, shirt, tie, and trousers. This layering is typical of formal clothing, often seen in elderly men dressing mildly formal.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base in Image B is depicted as cobblestone, reinforcing the idea of traditional roads made of stone. It surrounds the man's feet, indicating he stands on it.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the man positioned at the edge of the pool, facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image lacks the presence of a pool; hence, the notion of being at the pool's edge does not apply. The man is positioned on a cobblestone base, facing forward, which negates the presence of any pool.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image clearly depicts the man holding a golden staff or object in his right hand. Such object-holding in this context is aligned with prop usage for formal portrait poses.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no pool present; however, the ground is illustrated as a cobblestone base. This aligns with the look and texture of cobblestone materials.",
