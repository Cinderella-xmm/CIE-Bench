        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the control panels and water/ice dispensers are visibly and accurately located on the freezer doors of each refrigerator, maintaining the typical design and functionality expected in side-by-side refrigerator models. This consistency is checked against their correct placement as seen in the original layout of Image A.",

Without the upper kitchen cabinetry detail present, a direct comparison to Image Aâ€™s cabinetry cannot be made.",
