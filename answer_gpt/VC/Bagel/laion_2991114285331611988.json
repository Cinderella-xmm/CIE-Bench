      "question": "Is the plaid pattern (with red, blue, and black intersecting lines) on the left tie preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows a plaid tie with red, blue, and black intersecting lines. In such illustrations, patterns and colors are often exaggerated or stylized for effect, but they can be consistent with actual objects they represent. The image retains the plaid pattern, which is spatially consistent with the tie depicted on the left side in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the green and yellow bear-shaped emblem on the right tie preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the emblem on the right tie appears to be stylized; however, it resembles the real-world emblem seen in Image A. The cartoon version seems to incorporate the thematic elements of the original emblem, found on the figureâ€™s right tie. The edited image maintains a familiar emblematic presence.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are both ties preserved in their original necktie shape (narrow, tapered, diagonal across the chest)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon illustrations convey the tying and shaping of neckties in a classic stylized form, where ties typically appear narrow, tapered, and angled downwards. Comparing Image A, the ties follow the expected shape and position, maintaining their diagonal orientation across the chest.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the figure with the plaid tie on the left side of the image, and the figure with the emblem on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two figures, where one is wearing a plaid tie and the other features an emblem. From reference world knowledge, these spatial arrangements are consistent between both images. The spatial positioning is preserved with the figure wearing the plaid tie on the left, and the emblem tie on the right.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a clear, grassy field with visible green vegetation, spanning towards the horizon. This background setting matches the context commonly seen in open spaces and is consistent with the background in Image A. Such greenery typically represents outdoor locations in both real and illustrative scenarios.",
