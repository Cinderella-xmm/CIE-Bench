      "question": "Are the large, round brown eyes present and positioned symmetrically in the center of the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a blurred face with no visible eyes or facial features. The chibi-like style suggests simplified or exaggerated features, which could include large round eyes, but the blur obscures this detail. Without referring to Image A, the position and symmetry on Image B cannot be assessed accurately.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a crown-like accessory present on the top of the head, resembling the original tiara in form and placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a crown-like accessory is visibly placed on top of the head of the figure. Compared to Image A, where a detailed, diamond-like tiara is seen, Image B features a gold crown, which is different in design but similar in placement. Both images show this accessory on top of the head.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the face retain a soft oval shape with a small nose and a slight upward curve of the lips forming a gentle smile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the blurred face, we cannot ascertain the presence of a small nose or any curve indicative of a gentle smile. Without distinct facial features visible, this cannot be confirmed based merely on stylistic expectations alone of the chibi representation.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the skin tone light and fair with a natural pinkish blush visible on the cheeks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skin tone of the character appears to be light and fair, typical for chibi style figures. However, due to the blur, a natural pinkish blush on the cheeks is not discernible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both ears are visible on the sides of the head, which resembles a natural positioning for a chibi-style figure. The blur does not affect the visibility of the ears in the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair is brown and styled in a manner framing the blur where the face is. The soft waves are characteristic of the representation seen in such stylized depictions, although it's more simplified compared to Image A.",
