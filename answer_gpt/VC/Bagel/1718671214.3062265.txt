    "Question": "Q1: Is the metallic mask with horn-like protrusions at the temples present and retaining its original shape?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), there is no evidence of a metallic mask with horn-like protrusions visible in the artwork. The style appears to be more cartoonish than metallic.

    "Question": "Q2: Are the red lips and visible lower face (including chin and jawline) clearly present and unchanged?",
    "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) does not show red lips or a detailed lower face due to the face being intentionally obscured or stylistically simplified in cartoonish form.

    "Question": "Q5: Is the subjectâ€™s facial skin tone fair and uniformly lit, matching the original?",
    "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) does not provide detail on facial skin tone due to the style and obscured face. A cartoon form will usually not replicate realistic tonal variations as seen in original realistic images, but employ flat colors suitable for stylized representation.",
