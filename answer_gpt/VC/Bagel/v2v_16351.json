      "question": "Are the individuals' facial features, hairstyles, and body types retained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the individuals' facial features are blurred, but other aspects such as hairstyles and body types appear to remain the same as in Image A. The characters' hairstyles and posture align closely with their representations in the original image, suggesting continuity. Therefore, even with facial blurring, other physical details like hairstyle and body type seem consistent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the man in the suit still gesturing with his hands in the same manner as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images showcase the man in the suit gesturing outward with both hands. This indicates that the hand gesture remains unchanged between Image A and Image B. The suit ownerâ€™s hands are opened in a welcoming or presenting posture consistent across both images.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the relative positions of the characters (e.g., who is standing next to whom) retained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the characters maintain the same sequence and relative placement. The man in the suit is on the right, while the person in the jersey is next to him on the left side, which maintains the consistency of their positions from Image A to Image B.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the individuals still wearing the same type of clothing (e.g., jerseys, suit) as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows individuals dressed in similar types of clothing as in Image A. The individuals in jerseys and the man in a suit are dressed consistently between the two images, which implies no change in their clothing style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a clear focal point in the new setting that replaces the jersey's position in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the jersey in the locker is a dominant visual focus. However, in Image B, instead of a jersey, there is a chair and a framed picture on the wall. These elements do not draw the same focus or functional significance as the jersey, lacking a singular focal replacement.",
