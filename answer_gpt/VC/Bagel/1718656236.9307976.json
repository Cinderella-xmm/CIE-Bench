    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the subject retain the original facial structure, including the shape of the eyes, nose, and lips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face is obscured, so it is not possible to determine if the facial structure, including the shape of the eyes, nose, and lips, remains identical to other known structures. Given that the facial features are indiscernible, retaining the original structure is not possible to ascertain.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, earrings are visibly present and dangling from each side, indicating that the earrings are attached to the earlobes on both sides of the head. The visual cues of earrings hanging correspond to the typical location where earrings are worn.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not clearly display any braids extending from the sides of the head and hanging over the shoulders; instead, there are decorations suggesting a different style than braids. Therefore, the absence of braids noted visually suggests a change.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a necklace appears prominently around the neck, with a central pendant resting on the chest. The necklace placement aligns with conventional wearing of necklaces, so this follows expected positioning.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's face is obscured, preventing analysis of facial expressions and eye direction. Therefore, detecting eye contact or expression is not possible, resulting in an absence of evidence for direct facing with a neutral expression.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
