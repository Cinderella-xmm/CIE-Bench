      "question": "Are the carrots depicted in a bright orange color with their rounded-tapered shape preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrots are depicted with a vibrant orange color. They appear to maintain a rounded shape at the top; however, there is no clear tapered end visible. Typically, carrots have a rounded top and tapered bottom, though only the top part is shown in both images. Therefore, by observing the visible part in Image B, we can conclude the shape at least partially remains rounded. World knowledge informs us that a fully rounded-tapered shape includes both features, but without visible tapering, the preserved shape cannot be entirely confirmed.",

      "question": "Are the carrots topped with bright green serrated leaves with a lobed appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves emerging from the tops of the carrots are bright green and show a characteristic serrated and lobed appearance typical of carrot tops. This is consistent with common botanical features of carrot greens. The leaves appear fresh and vibrant, suggesting healthy carrot plants.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the soil texture surrounding the carrotsâ€™ roots preserved showing they are rooted in soil rather than snow or ice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the material surrounding the carrots appears to be altered and looks frozen or snowy, with visible icy and snow-like textures. This is different from typical soil's crumbly and dark appearance as shown in Image A. The material in Image B seems to look partly like broken clumps or frozen elements, indicating that they are not primarily set in soil.",

      "question": "Are the carrots positioned in a way that shows they are partially underground, consistent with their natural growth pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrots are embedded within the surrounding material (which resembles snow more than soil), with only the upper section visible, simulating how carrots grow partially underground. Despite the unconventional setting resembling a snowy environment, the positioning of carrots mimics their natural partially underground growth.",

      "question": "Do the carrots have visible surface textures like natural ridges or marks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the carrots shows some texture, including ridges and linear marks that are typical on carrots due to their growing process. Such details can indicate natural growth and the skin's texture. These visible surface markings are consistent with how carrots usually appear.",
