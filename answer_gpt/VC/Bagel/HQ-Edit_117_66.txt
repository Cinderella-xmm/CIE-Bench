    "Question": "Q1: Are there exactly four dragons, one in each quadrant of the cover?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a puzzle image is shown with a design containing dragons placed around a central compass. There appears to be the silhouette or design of dragons; however, upon analysis, there aren't distinct, full dragons in each quadrant due to the puzzle nature. Each section doesn't clearly define a complete dragon, unlike traditionally where dragons would be distinctly separated. Therefore, it appears that not all sections feature a distinct dragon.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a central circular compass composed of concentric rings with inscribed characters?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central design resembles a compass with a star shape at the center, and piecemeal lines create sections similar to concentric circles, but the circles do not feature inscribed characters as would be commonly seen in more intricate or traditional designs.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a star-shaped pointer located at the center of the compass?",
    "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, shows a central compass design with a star-shaped pointer, similar to the classic starburst design found in compasses, with a central node and extending points, which serves as the pointer.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the dragons arranged symmetrically around the central compass, with each facing toward the center?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of dragon-like elements around the central compass doesn't display a symmetrical positioning with clear dragon figures facing towards the center. Instead, the puzzle pieces create a more abstract representation, lacking the definitive facing and symmetry one would expect if they were traditionally arranged.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the dragons separated by cross-shaped lines dividing the cover into four equal quadrants?",
    "explanation": "The puzzle pieces in Image B form a division that loosely resembles quarters, but they do not create a classic cross shape that clearly segments the piece into four equal parts. The divisions are primarily due to puzzle edges and do not distinctly separate dragons with cross lines.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there Chinese characters inscribed within the concentric rings of the central compass?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a central compass design with concentric circles, but the circles do not contain visible characters. This design is more stylized and lacks intrinsic detailed inscriptions, such as characters.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do the dragons have coiled bodies with raised heads and extended claws, consistent with traditional Chinese dragon depictions?",
    "explanation": "The dragons in Image B are represented in a highly abstracted form due to the puzzle style, lacking the specific details such as coiled bodies, raised heads, or extended claws typical in traditional Chinese dragon imagery. The simplified representation does not convey these classic features.",
    "answer": "No"
