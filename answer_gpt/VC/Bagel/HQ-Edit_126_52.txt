    "Question": "Q1: Is the cactus still spherical in overall shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus remains round and has retained its spherical shape, despite the additions of eyes and crystal-like spikes on its surface. This can be concluded from the visual representation where the contour of the cactus is still circular, signifying a spherical shape.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the vertical ribs of the cactus clearly visible and maintaining their segmented pattern?",
    "explanation": "Image B still shows the vertical ribs of the cactus as visible and segmented, although they have been decorated with inscriptions or symbols. The ribs continue to divide the surface of the cactus, indicating the original pattern is maintained.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Is the main body of the cactus still predominantly green in color?",
    "explanation": "Despite the addition of various elements such as symbols and eyes, Image B shows that the main body of the cactus is predominantly green. This suggests that the edited picture is keeping the original color scheme of the cactus.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the cactus positioned vertically and resting on a flat surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus is vertically positioned, resting atop a flat pedestal-like structure. This pedestal supports the cactus, indicating a vertical positioning against the backdrop of the sky.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a textured, flat surface beneath the cactus container?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, beneath the cactus container is a smooth, pedestal-like surface instead of the textured wooden surface seen in Image A. The visible flat textured surface of Image A is not present, with the pedestal serving as the primary support.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the cactus placed directly above a supporting structure (such as a pedestal or pot)?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the cactus directly above a supporting pedestal structure. The design replaces the pot seen in Image A with a pedestal-like formation that supports the cactus, indicating that it is indeed positioned above a support structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the light source coming from the upper left, casting shadows toward the lower right?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the light source is depicted in the upper left corner with the sun casting light. The visible shadows and light patterns suggest that light direction is consistent with the overall illumination, implying shadows might be cast toward the lower right.",
    "answer": "Yes"
