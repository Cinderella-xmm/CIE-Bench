      "question": "Is the toilet still predominantly white in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toilet appears to be predominantly white color. This determination is made by observing the main components of the toilet, including the bowl, lid, and tank, which all appear to be in a consistent shade of white based on their brightness and lack of variation in color.",

      "question": "Is the toilet lid still open?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, it can be seen that the toilet lid is open. This is determined by the visual cue showing the lid standing upright and the top part of the toilet bowl is visible which indicates an open lid.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flush tank is visibly attached to the toilet and is not shown as separate or removed. The connection between the tank and toilet is visually intact, indicating it's still above it rather than beneath it.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the walls and floor of the bathroom covered in square tiles of a gray hue. This is consistent with the observed pattern of squares on the walls and floor, and the visual texture that suggests tiling.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the toilet positioned along two intersecting lines created by the adjoining walls, which implies it is in the corner of the room. This is assessed by the visual proximity of the toilet to the walls and the spatial configuration.",
