    "Question": "Q1: Does the ship retain exactly three masts, with sails arranged in tiers on each mast?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are three distinct masts on the model ship, and each mast features sails arranged in multiple tiers. This arrangement is typical for traditional sailing ships, where sails are stacked vertically to optimize wind capture. My observation that each mast has tiers of sails leads to the conclusion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the ship’s hull shaped with a raised stern and a decorated, upward-curving prow?",
    "explanation": "The model ship in Image B has a hull where the stern appears slightly raised, typical of many historic sailing ships designed for efficient movement through water. The prow is also shaped upwards, which is common for both aesthetic and functional reasons in ship design. This indicates that the model captures these historical design elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there multiple sails on each of the three masts, with at least two tiers per mast?",
    "explanation": "On closer inspection of Image B, each of the three masts has multiple sails arranged in at least two tiers. This tiered arrangement is visible as the sails are stacked in layers one above the other, which is a characteristic feature of full-rigged ships.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there at least five seagulls visible in flight around the ship?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, several seagulls can be observed surrounding the ship model. Counting them reveals at least five distinct seagull figures crafted as part of the model, which portrays a scenic maritime environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the ship oriented such that the bow points toward the left side of the image and is slightly elevated?",
    "explanation": "The ship model in Image B is positioned such that its bow points towards the left side. However, it does not show any elevation in the bow; it appears even and flat along with the rest of the model within its encasing.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there visible portholes along the sides of the ship’s hull?",
    "explanation": "Examining the ship model in Image B, no portholes are visible along the sides of the hull. The sides are smooth, which suggests the portholes are either artistically minimized due to the scale or intentionally omitted.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the ship positioned above the surface of the water/resin layer, appearing to float?",
    "explanation": "The ship in Image B is positioned such that it looks like it's floating above the blue resin layer, which represents water. This design choice is typical for ships in bottles or models encased in domes, giving the illusion of buoyancy.",
    "answer": "Yes"
