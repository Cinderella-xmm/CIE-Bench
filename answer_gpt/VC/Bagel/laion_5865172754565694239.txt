    "Question": "Q1: Is the 'DUCATI' text in white lettering clearly visible along the down tube of the frame?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycle has a cartoonish style with animated features like a face on the frame, compared to Image A's realistic depiction. The visual focus is on the animated aspects rather than text; thus, 'DUCATI' text visibility is affected due to its absence or lack of emphasis on the frame. Image A has a clearly visible 'DUCATI' text on the down tube, but Image B does not visually emphasize this detail.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the 'DUCATI' text in white lettering visible on the seat stay?",
