        "** Yes",
        "No\n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is shown in various poses with a brush and paper, typical indicators of watercolor painting activity. The character is engaged in painting in most, if not all, stickers, as inferred from their actions and the presence of painting tools. Therefore, it can be concluded that the character is actively painting in each sticker.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "** Are the painting tools (palette, brushes, paper, glass of water) present and interacted with by the character in each sticker?\n**",
      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No\n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe the presence of a brush and paper in each of the stickers where the character is depicted. While the glass of water and palette are common painting tools, not all stickers clearly depict them being interacted with. Given that the primary painting tool, the brush, and paper, are present, it can still be inferred that the character is engaging with painting tools in each sticker. However, the glass is not depicted.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No\n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character consistently features brown hair and wears a shirt that resembles a beige tone across all stickers. This visual trait of brown hair and a consistent shirt color is observed in each illustration, reinforcing character continuity.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No\n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several stickers visibly show watercolor strokes on the paper where the character is painting. This depiction aligns with the typical results of watercolor painting, which include colored strokes and patterns. Hence, watercolor strokes are visible in at least one of the stickers.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "** Is there a depiction of natural lighting or a similar lighting effect in at least one of the stickers?\n**",
      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No\n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting in each sticker is uniform, employing a flat and consistent color style inherent to illustrative stickers rather than capturing natural lighting effects such as shadows or variations typical of natural lighting. Illustrations often do not include such elements, and this set adheres to that style.",
