    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the background a uniform beige color without any gradient, pattern, or texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a single color without any visible patterns or gradients. It appears as a flat, uniform beige color, which is consistent with the description. This indicates that the background lacks variation or texture.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the background have no visible texture, grain, or surface variation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is smooth and lacks any discernible texture or grain. It appears as a flat color, without any surface variations that would otherwise be noticeable if there were texture present. This confirms that the background is textureless.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there no shadows, reflections, or light variations on the background surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is evenly lit with no visible shadows, reflections, or light variations. The consistent color and lack of shadow edges indicate uniform lighting, suggesting there are no fluctuations in light or shadow on the surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the image framed with straight edges and no border or crop distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is well-framed with clean and straight edges. There is no evidence of a border or any distortions at the edges, which implies that the image was cropped or framed properly without any warping or misshaping.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighting on the background evenly distributed with no hotspots or directional shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B appears to be even and consistent across the background. There are no visible hotspots where the light might be more intense, nor are there directional shadows that could suggest uneven lighting. This uniform light distribution means that there are no anomalies in how the background is lit.",
