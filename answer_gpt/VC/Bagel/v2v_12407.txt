    "Question": "Q1: Is the mango depicted with an oval shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object that seems to represent a mango appears to have an oval or elliptical shape. Even though the image is stylized and pixelated with retro video game-like graphics, the mango is depicted with a rounded top and bottom, suggesting an oval shape. This aligns with the common shape of mangoes as known by general knowledge.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a small stem visible at the top of the mango?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, there does not appear to be a distinguishable small stem at the top of the mango-like object. The area at the top that might represent a stem is not clearly defined due to the pixelated art style. Stems are often small and uniform in color, which makes them difficult to perceive in highly pixelated images.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the paper towel folded into a cradle-like shape beneath the mango?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object beneath the mango appears to be a folded paper towel or napkin that lifts and holds the mango-like object in place. The pixelated depiction still shows a cradle-like arrangement with raised edges that suggest a supporting structure under the object.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there four clearly defined flaps extending from the paper towel?",
    "explanation": "The stylized Image B shows a paper towel beneath the mango with extensions that could resemble flaps. Although the pixelation makes it less precise, there seem to be four areas extending outward from the central mango, indicating the paper towel flaps.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the mango positioned in the center of the table?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mango-like object is not positioned as centrally as in Image A. The artistic stylization and pixelation alter the perception of the center positioning, and based on the elements visible, the orientation and limited details available in the image, it appears to be placed more towards one side than directly in the center.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the table show a horizontal wood grain pattern?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not realistically depict wood grain due to its highly pixelated, stylized art style. Any wood grain pattern is abstracted by the pixelation and is represented only in broad colors without the detail necessary to suggest a specific wood grain direction.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is a wooden chair partially visible behind the table?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no discernible element that clearly depicts a wooden chair. The background mostly features large areas of solid color, characteristic of a pixel art style, with no specific shapes resembling a chair.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Is there a diagonal shadow cast by the mango onto the table?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts shadows through contrasting color blocks. There appears to be a diagonal darker area on the surface where the mango sits, indicating an attempt to represent a shadow. Although precise directional representations are lost in the pixelation, the shadow seems to trend diagonally.",
    "answer": "Yes"
