      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl does not appear at all. Instead, there is a depiction of a cartoon bear wearing large round black-rimmed glasses. This change in visual representation leads to the conclusion that the girl does not wear such glasses in Image B.",

    {

      "question": "Is the girl wearing a white lab coat with a visible button on the left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a cartoon bear dressed in a white lab coat with buttons visible. Since Image B does not feature the girl wearing any garments, the analysis of Image B does not support the conclusion that a girl is wearing a white lab coat with a visible button on the left side.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Is the background a dark green chalkboard surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is illustrated as a dark green chalkboard surface, as indicated by chalk-like drawings and elements such as equations and scientific apparatus. This visual cue aligns with the common depiction of a chalkboard in an educational setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text consists of whimsical phrases that do not include the word 'CURIOSITY.' As Image B has replaced these words, the analysis does not indicate that 'CURIOSITY' is written in uppercase letters on the chalkboard.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of a cartoon teddy bear with a red bow tie on the chalkboard. Instead, there is a bear wearing a white lab coat. Thus, the analysis does not confirm the presence of a teddy bear with a red bow tie on the chalkboard.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features phrases, but none of these include the word 'JOYFUL.' Therefore, based on Image B, the word 'JOYFUL' is not written on the chalkboard.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents various illustrations but does not include a red circular sun with triangular rays on the chalkboard. The substitution of scientific and whimsical elements excludes such imagery from being present.",
