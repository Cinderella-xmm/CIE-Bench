      "question": "Are the two main mountain peaks still present and positioned side by side as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a large creature resembling a fantastical animal rather than geographical features like mountains. The visual cues in Image B suggest that the mountain peaks have been replaced, as there is no indication of such formations. Comparing this to Image A, which clearly displays two mountain peaks side by side, it becomes apparent that these features are not retained in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the summits of both peaks retain patches of snow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) depicts a creature with green and brown textures and moss-like growths, rather than a snowy summit. In Image A, the white patches are visibly snow on the peaks. Since no such snow is present or identifiable on the creature's body in Image B, the patches of snow on the mountain summits are not retained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the horizontal and vertical rock strata visible on the mountain faces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a creature with no sign of rock strata. Image A has visible horizontal and vertical rock formations that make up the mountain face. Image B's focus is on an organic texture rather than geological strata, indicating the strata are not visible in the edited image.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the narrow road visible winding through the lower valley, extending toward the base of the mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not showcase any features resembling a road or valley. Instead, it focuses on the creature in a non-geographical context. Image A does show a narrow winding path through the valley leading towards the mountains. Comparing these details reveals that the road is not depicted in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the slopes covered in patches of brownish-orange heather and dry grass, particularly in the mid-ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses primarily on the creature, where the body exhibits a greenish, moss-like texture with no elements of vegetation like heather or grass. Image A, however, has brownish-orange heather and dry grass evident on the slopes. The lack of such vegetation in Image B suggests the slopes are not covered as they are in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the sky uniformly overcast with no direct sunlight, resulting in soft shadows across the landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an overcast sky above the creature, creating soft lighting that suggests diffused light and overcast conditions similar to Image A. Although the focus in Image B is different, the visual cues for the sky suggest consistent lighting conditions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no indication of valleys with contour lines following a natural land slope. The scene is dominated by the fantasy creature. Image A displays smooth contour lines alongside the mountains' slopes, which are absent in Image B.",
