    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the atomic design retain the three intersecting elliptical orbits with a central nucleus and three electron positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the atomic design includes colorful elliptical loops and several small brown spheres distributed around the central blue sphere, resembling electrons. However, there are primarily two intersecting loops rather than three, as seen in the configured structure near the top of the image. The design focuses on a colorful representation, but does not display three distinct elliptical orbits as described.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the white plastic cookie cutter retaining its original atomic-shaped outline with three elliptical loops and a central nucleus?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The white plastic cookie cutter in Image B is not visible at all; the focus is more on a representation of atoms and cookies with colorful loops and spheres. Therefore, the atomic-shaped outline with three elliptical loops and a central nucleus found in Image A is not directly represented here.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cookie cutter positioned to the left of the atomic imprint, with a partial edge overlap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain a depiction of the cookie cutter or the dough with an imprint. The image is focused on a designed representation of atoms and cookies. Consequently, the question does not apply as there is no such positioning or overlap depicted.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the atomic imprint in the dough have clean, continuous edges without breaks or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no dough with an atomic imprint visible. The image concentrates on illustrations and vibrant elements relating to atomic structures and cookie design concepts, thus no assessment of imprint quality can be made.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a small central hole in the nucleus area of the atomic imprint?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a cookie dough with an atomic imprint including a central hole. The image centers around graphical representations of atomic designs with more of a cartoonish style, without any real dough or imprint details.",
