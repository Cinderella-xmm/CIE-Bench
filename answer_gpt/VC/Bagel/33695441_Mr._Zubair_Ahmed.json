    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image preserve the concentric spiral structure of the staircase, with steps forming progressively smaller rings as they descend toward the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the spiral structure visually resembles the pattern found in staircases, which is characterized by concentric rings. This is now transformed into a snakelike creature coiled in a similar shape. Using world knowledge, we understand that both images share a spiral pattern, although the elements creating the pattern are different.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the parallel rectangular shadows cast across the steps by sunlight still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From the visual cues in the edited image, there are no parallel rectangular shadows across the structure as seen in the original image. The texture and lighting in the edited image create different patterns that do not resemble the parallel shadows cast by sunlight on steps.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a dark circular void at the center of the spiral, representing the bottom of the staircase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not feature a dark circular void at the center. Instead, the focus is on the snakelike figure. The center of the spiral pattern is occupied by the creatureâ€™s coil rather than an open void typical of stairs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the handrail remain aligned along the outer edge of the spiral, following the same curvature as the steps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the handrail is not present. The structure is visualized as a snake instead of a staircase with a handrail. Therefore, no handrail follows the edge.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the stone steps still visible with their original texture, including faint veining and minor surface imperfections, even if reinterpreted as scales?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a texture similar to scales, which does not replicate stone with veining or imperfections as seen in the original image. The reinterpretation as scales completely abandons stone-like features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the shadows fall in the same diagonal direction across the steps as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the direction of the shadows is absent, as the image highlights the snakelike creature without noticeable shadows across steps. The original image had shadows cast diagonally, establishing lighting direction, which the edited image lacks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
