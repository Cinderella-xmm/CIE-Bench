    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a river running down the center of the image from the foreground to the distant mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central portion features a blue area stretching from the foreground towards the background, splitting the lower half of the image into two. This blue area visually represents a river as it cuts through the middle towards the mountains, mimicking the linear progression of a water body. The use of blue suggests water. Based on the color and central positioning, it's reasonable to conclude that it's intended to represent a river.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there two large mountain peaks visible in the background, one on the left and one on the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals stylized triangular shapes with sharp peaks on both the left and right upper portions, signifying mountains. Each side has a distinct peak, common to mountain representations in art and design, placed in the background. These peaks are consistent with typical mountain depictions and are visually balanced in the composition.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a bright circular light source positioned near the center of the horizon line in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a circular shape is depicted near the center of the horizon line, characterized by a bright red color. Typically, such a shape in art can represent a light source such as the sun. The use of contrast with the darker surrounding colors enhances its prominence in the scene, suggesting it is a source of light.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there trees present on both sides of the river, extending along the banks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, tree-like shapes are evident on both sides of the blue river-like feature. These elements stretch along the riverbanks from the foreground to the background, resembling stylized trees with tapered shapes and varied heights. By these visual indicators, the presence of trees along both sides of the river is confirmed.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible rock formations or landmasses within the river, breaking the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the representation of the river is continuous and unbroken by any landmasses or formations. There are no visual cues showing disruptions that could represent rocks or land within the blue river area. The stylized design emphasizes geometric shapes, and no such additional shapes are apparent within the river.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the river reflect the trees and sky above it, maintaining a mirrored image across the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is stylized in a simplified manner with graphical art. The river depicted does not show detailed reflections of surrounding elements like trees or sky. The river is primarily a bold block of color without texture or variance indicating reflection. This contrasts with a typical mirrored image on a water surface, thus lacking in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the trees on the riverbanks colored in warm autumn tones such as red, orange, and yellow, with dark green conifers interspersed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees are represented using a palette of colors like orange and yellow, giving an impression of warm autumn tones. However, dark green conifers are not distinctly noticeable in the stylized depiction. The art maintains a primary color theme without specific differentiation for conifers.",
