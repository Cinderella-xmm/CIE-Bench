      "question": "Are the four minarets positioned symmetrically—two on the left and two on the right—relative to the central dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, analyzing the entire composition and structure of the scene, we observe the architectural elements of four minarets located in a mosque-like structure. They are positioned with two minarets on each side of the central dome. This arrangement is commonly seen in historical mosque structures such as Hagia Sophia, where minarets are symmetrically placed for aesthetic balance. Hence, the visual cues support the symmetry. ",

      "question": "Is the 15 July Martyrs Bridge clearly visible in the background, crossing the water behind the Hagia Sophia?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the horizon behind the structure features a bridge-like element crossing a body of water. While the general outline resembles a bridge, the image does not present clear distinctive features of the 15 July Martyrs Bridge, such as its characteristic design. Thus, the analysis requires utilizing visual cues from the image, where the details of the bridge are not distinctly presented.",

      "question": "Is a large body of water visible behind the Hagia Sophia, extending toward the horizon with boats on its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a substantial expanse of water directly behind the prominent structure of the Hagia Sophia, extending into the horizon. Small boats are discernible on the water's surface. These features indicate the presence of a large body of water, broader in scope, commonly representative of bodies of water like the Bosphorus Strait near historical sites such as Hagia Sophia. Thus, the visual cues fulfill the description of a large water body with boats visible.",

      "question": "Are green trees visible in the foreground, partially obscuring the base of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground contains a sizable area with dark green hues suggestive of dense vegetation, and these trees are positioned adjacent to the base of the architectural structure. The visual cues of green textures hint at trees partially obscuring parts of the base, reinforcing common imagery employed to present naturalistic settings around monumental structures.",

      "question": "Are multiple arched windows visible on the front-facing wall beneath the central dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, beneath the central dome, the front-facing wall includes numerous arched openings. Architecturally, Hagia Sophia features these distinct arched windows contributing to structural aesthetics and daylighting. Hence, the image’s visual cues confirm these elements with their arrangement renowned globally.",

      "question": "Are several smaller domes visible around the base of the central dome, forming a tiered roofline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the large central dome remains a focal point, surrounding it are smaller domes giving rise to a tiered configuration. These details are reminiscent and consistent with historical architectural designs seen in establishments like Hagia Sophia, where secondary domes provide structural support and artistic balance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a clear sky extending above the architectural structure. The color palette remains uniformly light blue without the presence of clouds, echoing common daytime conditions. Visual cues from the clear, unobstructed sky lend to a typical daytime atmosphere, supporting this interpretation rigorously.",
