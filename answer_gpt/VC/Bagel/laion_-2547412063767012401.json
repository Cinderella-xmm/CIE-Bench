    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the three figures positioned such that one is on the left, one in the center, and one on the right from the viewer's perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the three figures are distinctly positioned in a triangular formation with one on the left, one in the center, and one on the right from the viewer's perspective. This is a common composition style for group portrayals. The positioning allows for each figure to be distinct while maintaining a balanced visual interest across the image.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the central figure standing fully upright with both feet on the rock and facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure is depicted in a heroic stance typical of fantasy illustrations, wearing armor. The stance suggests stability and readiness, often portrayed with feet planted firmly. However, the question implies both feet are visibly on a rock surface, and the illustration style may exaggerate positioning which isn't explicitly visible.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the ocean visible in the background behind the figures, with waves breaking against rocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a fantasy-themed background. While not a realistic depiction, there are elements meant to suggest an oceanic scene, such as swirling blues and whites indicative of water and waves, resembling ocean waves breaking against rocks. However, due to the stylized nature, it might not convey realistic wave movement as in a photograph.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the figures standing on dark, jagged rock formations in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures appear to be standing on an abstract or stylized terrain that imitates jagged rock formations. This is common in fantasy illustrations where the ground they're on consists of sharp, angular shapes to evoke dramatic settings, similar to rocks.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sun positioned directly behind the central figure, creating a bright glow between his legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is lighting suggesting a powerful light source behind the central figure, as often depicted in fantasy images to create a dramatic backdrop. However, the clear replication of a sun and its exact effect between legs isn't visually apparent like a photograph would show.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a clear horizon line separating the sky from the ocean in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a stylized artistic depiction rather than a realistic scene. There might be color transitions that suggest sky and ocean, but no distinct horizon line is present due to the artistic style emphasizing fantastical elements rather than a realistic separation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the figure on the right have long, wavy hair extending past the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are wearing helmets with decorative features that mimic the look of hair, including long, wavy extensions. These stylistic elements often resemble armor sets and are meant to evoke a fantastical, heroic appearance rather than represent actual hair.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Does the figure on the left have curly, light brown hair reaching past the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure on the left is depicted in full armor with design elements resembling hair texture. Armor and decorative pieces are influential in fantasy artistry, suggesting hair-like forms but not specifically curly, light brown hair visible as it would be depicted naturally.",
