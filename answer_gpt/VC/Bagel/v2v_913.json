    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the cake retain its two distinct layers of dark chocolate sponge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake appears to maintain two distinct layers of chocolate sponge, as evidenced by the separation in the middle of the cake where one can visually identify the chocolate filling. This structure aligns with common cake preparation where cakes are layered with filling between. Therefore, the distinct layers are present.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the top of the cake covered in a glossy, reflective chocolate glaze?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the cake appears to have a glossy finish that is typical of chocolate glazes. This is inferred from the shine and reflective streaks indicated in the cake illustration, which is consistent with how a glossy surface interacts with light.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there three visible streams of chocolate glaze dripping down the front face of the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that there are streams of chocolate glaze falling down the front face of the cake. Visual evidence allows us to count these streams, resulting in three distinct drips being visible, which is recognizable from the glaze pattern and its coverage on the cake.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the cake layers exhibit a dark brown, moist, and porous sponge texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the drawn depiction in Image B, the cake layers have a porous look and appear dark, which often indicates moist sponge texture in chocolate cakes. The illustration uses visual cues that suggest this common cake texture type.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the cake placed on a white circular plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake is placed on a plate. The drawing indicates it is circular in shape and could be interpreted as white based on light color use consistent with typical plate depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the cake maintain its triangular cross-sectional shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the cake keeps its triangle form, which is typical of cake slices. In Image B, where the illustration simplifies textural elements, the triangular shape is maintained, highlighting characteristic cross-sectional presentation of cake slices.",
