      "question": "Is the long, curly, voluminous white beard present and extending down the front of the chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure does not have a long, curly, voluminous white beard extending down the front of the chest. Instead, the figure appears to be wearing a costume more typical of a historical or adventure character, as indicated by the tricorn hat and other attire. This lack of white beard suggests the image does not feature a Santa Claus-like figure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the thin-rimmed glasses worn on the face, positioned over the eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the analyzed costumed figure does not appear to be wearing any glasses. Characters portrayed in historical or pirate-themed costumes, which this appears to be, typically do not wear thin-rimmed glasses as part of their ensemble.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the right arm extended outward with the palm facing upward and fingers slightly spread?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right arm is extended outward, but the palm faces downward and the fingers do not appear to be slightly spread; they are more in a curved position, consistent with someone waving or presenting something.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the mouth curved upward in a smile and the eyes slightly crinkled at the corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the blurred face in the image, it's not possible to discern the expression, such as a smile or crinkling of the eyes. Therefore, we don't have enough visual information to conclude if the expression is a smile or not.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the head turned slightly to the left side of the frame, facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head is oriented such that the figure's eyes would likely be facing forward rather than turned to the left side of the frame. The orientation is typical of someone who is engaging with an audience, common in portrayals of charismatic or authoritative figures.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the facial features including the nose, eyebrows, and cheeks clearly visible and consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features are not clearly visible due to the blurred effect applied over the face area, which prevents us from confirming if they match the features in Image A or making a comparative analysis.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the fingers of the right hand splayed outward with natural spacing between them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right hand fingers are moderately splayed with natural spacing between them, though they are slightly curved to suggest motion or character gesture.",
