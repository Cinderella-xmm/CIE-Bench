    "Question": "Q1: Are the battery tops rendered in copper color?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, robotic characters reminiscent of stylized batteries are depicted. World knowledge about battery designs indicates that common battery tops, such as those of Duracell, are often copper-colored. While the image shows orange highlights, it cannot be confirmed that a copper top exists, especially as Image B's focus is on stylized robotic forms, not detailed batteries.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the word 'DURACELL' printed vertically in white on the black body of each battery?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on three robotic figures with a thematic aesthetic, emulating battery-like features. However, they do not show distinct battery labeling common to Duracell products, particularly not vertically printed white text, as bodies of robots don't feature such specific inscriptions.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a silver band near the base of each battery with the word 'DURALOCK' inscribed on it?",
    "explanation": "Image B features futuristic robotic characters styled with battery motifs. Despite the aesthetic similarities, these robotic figures do not include specific designs such as silver bands with inscriptions like 'DURALOCK,' which typically appear in real battery product designs.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the phrase '10 Years in Storage' visibly present in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a futuristic scene with robotics and stylized text saying '10 YEARS STRROG'. This phrase seems to be an altered version suggesting '10 Years in Storage', aligning with the concept of battery longevity, a common promotional phrase. World knowledge helps infer the intended meaning despite the textual misspelling.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there exactly four batteries or battery-inspired characters depicted?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are three robotic figures prominently displayed. Understanding the design cues, these seem to represent stylized battery-inspired characters. The count of three does not match the question's four-battery criteria.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the brand name 'DURACELL' displayed in large, bold letters at the top of the image?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the word 'DURACELL' displayed prominently in large, bold letters at the top of the image. This aligns with typical brand placement in product advertisements, ensuring immediate brand recognition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
