      "question": "Does the refrigerator retain its clear glass shelves with the same arrangement as the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the refrigerator indeed retains its clear glass shelves with the same arrangement as seen in Image A. Both images display shelves in identical positions within the refrigerator's interior. World knowledge about standard refrigerator construction and design supports the observation that shelves often have consistent placements and styles unless explicitly altered.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the specific food items (like fruits, bottles, and jars) present in their original positions within the refrigerator?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B and Image A feature identical positions for the food items within the refrigerator. The arrangement of bottles on the door shelves, jars, fruits, and other food items remain constant. By comparing both images and understanding typical storage practices in refrigerators, it is evident that there has been no rearrangement or removal of these items.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the countertop with the fruit bowl and plant placed adjacent to the refrigerator, as seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the countertop next to the refrigerator, consistent with its placement in Image A. The visual information confirms the continuity of kitchen layout, where the arrangement of the countertop, fruit bowl, and plant remains identical. General understanding of kitchen design suggests such arrangements are rarely altered without reason, which the comparison further supports.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the background maintain the same clean, light-colored kitchen design, including the wall tiles and window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B replicates the kitchen design seen in Image A, with identical light-colored wall tiles and a window. The kitchen's minimalist design elements are unchanged, which supports the typical approach to maintain aesthetic unity in interior design. The direct comparison of both images provides evidence of this consistency.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Apart from the specified logo replacement and custom label, are there no additional alterations to the appearance of the refrigerator?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B introduces a custom label on the top of the refrigerator, noted as 'X's Fresh Zone', which is not present in Image A. This is the only alteration visible when comparing both images. Through understanding of image editing practices, it's clear that aside from this text change, the refrigerator's appearance remains unchanged, illustrating a consistent object-oriented focus typical in edited images.",
