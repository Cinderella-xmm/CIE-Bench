    "Question": "Q1: Is the Great Wall depicted as a continuous, zigzagging structure following the contours of the mountain ridges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the Great Wall is depicted inside a snow globe. It is displayed as a miniature, zigzagging structure. This portrayal aligns with how the real Great Wall follows the contours of the mountains. The visual cues show the wall curving and changing directions similar to the real Great Wall. However, the context of Image B being a snow globe makes it more artistic and stylized.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the walls constructed with visible gray stone bricks and topped with crenellated battlements?",
