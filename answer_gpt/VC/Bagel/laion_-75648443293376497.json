      "question": "Is the roll-top closure secured by two vertical brown leather straps positioned symmetrically on the front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object appears to be a design element reminiscent of a satchel with a fictitious and stylized graphic look. The front features buckles and decorative elements but does not represent an actual backpack with a roll-top closure. Therefore, there are no functional straps securing a roll-top closure as seen in practical backpacks. Comparing this with common visual characteristics of backpacks, the design focus used in Image B leans towards aesthetic rather than practical structure.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a central snap button closure on the front flap of the backpack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a purely decorative front design with bold typography and conceptual elements centered around a vintage theme. There is no indication of a snap button closure seen in practical backpacks; the focus is instead on stylistic text and graphic features. Thus, based on the decorative nature and absence of functional snap fasteners, the conclusion is that there is no central snap button closure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there two side pockets, each trimmed with brown leather, located on the left and right sides of the backpack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, it is clear that there aren't any three-dimensional elements such as pockets. Instead, Image B presents a flat, stylized representation with graphic design in mind, not reflecting the physical dimensions or features such as pockets seen on traditional backpacks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a small rectangular leather brand patch located on the lower right front panel of the backpack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design features labels and texts such as 'EXPLORE VINTAGE', but thereâ€™s no visible small rectangular leather patch like a brand tag commonly found on backpacks. Instead, the elements are graphically placed to create a thematic representation. Thus, recognizing these visual cues, there's no traditional branding patch.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there two metal D-rings attached to the bottom corners of the backpack via brown leather loops?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the stylized Image B, there is no indication of utilitarian components such as metal D-rings attached with leather loops at the bottom corners. The design is more symbolic and artistic with no functional attachment hardware like D-rings typically utilized in real backpack designs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the shoulder straps symmetrically aligned and centered relative to the backpack body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any three-dimensional form of a backpack to constitute shoulder straps. Instead, the design is more akin to a front-facing design element with no visible structure for practical use, implying the absence of straps or symmetrically aligned design indicative of physical backpacks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there visible stitching lines defining the compartments and edges of the backpack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon viewing Image B, no stitching lines are apparent, as the design is illustrative and more reliant on graphic depiction than physical detailing found in sewn objects like backpacks. Hence, there are no defined compartments with stitching visible in this artistic presentation.",
