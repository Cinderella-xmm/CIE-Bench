      "question": "Is the adult polar bear positioned behind the two cubs, with the cubs visibly interacting with each other?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the adult polar bear is positioned behind two smaller polar bears, likely cubs, based on size difference. The cubs appear to be in close proximity, suggesting interaction. This determination is made by observing the spatial arrangement and size of the bears, which aligns with typical protective postures and behaviors seen in nature.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ice and snow textures are visible, showing variations in surface smoothness and ridges. These details are clear and add realism to the scene, indicating undisturbed environmental features despite added text and logos.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a backdrop of dark blue ocean water behind the ice floe. The visual cues of the color and texture of the ocean are consistent with natural water bodies, indicating that the background scene remains unchanged.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Natural lighting and shadow effects are observable on the polar bears and ice in Image B. Light and shadow impact how three-dimensionality and texture are perceived, which are consistent with realistic environmental lighting, showing preservation of these effects.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The polar bears in Image B have a white fur color characteristic of their species. Their appearance aligns with the natural characteristics of polar bears, with no evident color alterations or modifications in the editing process.",
