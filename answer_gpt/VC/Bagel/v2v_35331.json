      "question": "Is the background composed of green grass with visible blades and natural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a visible grassy area with individual blades of grass discernible, giving it a natural texture. This conclusion is based on the observation of the distinct variations in the shape and arrangement of the grass blades, which are typical of a grassy surface. The grass is green, supporting the presence of a natural texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there soft shadows cast by the subject(s) onto the grass, consistent with natural outdoor lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon examining the areas around the dog and the banana, we can detect softer shadowing effects at the base of these subjects, indicating natural outdoor lighting conditions. Outdoor lighting typically results in shadows adjusted in softness depending on the position of the light source relative to the objects. Hence, the soft shadows in Image B are consistent with such lighting.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the fused form positioned directly on the grass surface, with contact points visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the banana and small dog appear positioned right on the surface of the grass. At the base of the banana as well as the feet of the dog, they visually touch the grass blades, suggesting direct contact with the grassy surface. This is supported by the visible overlap of the grass with the base area of both the objects.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the grass predominantly green with natural variations in shade and tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is mainly composed of green grass, with discernible variations in the green shades and tones, providing a realistic appearance of a grassy area. These variations typically occur in natural environments due to differing lighting conditions and the inherent diversity of individual grass blades.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the fused form incorporate both yellow and tan hues, reflecting the original banana and dog colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the banana displays a yellow hue, and the dog's coat is tan, showing a blend of these two distinct colors from the original subjects. Thus, the image keeps the inherent colors of the banana and the dog consistent, confirming the incorporation of both hues in the fused form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are individual blades of grass visible in the foreground and midground, contributing to a textured surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits distinct individual grass blades in the foreground and midground, adding to the textured surface of the grassy background. This detail is visible and contributes to the realism and richness of the image, as each blade contributes to the complete look of a textured grassy area.",
