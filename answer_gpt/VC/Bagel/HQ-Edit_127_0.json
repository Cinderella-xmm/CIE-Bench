      "question": "Is the owl's face clearly depicted with two large, dark, round eyes and a distinct facial disc?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, due to the blur applied over the owl's face, the facial features such as eyes and facial disc are not clearly depicted. Typically, an owl's face would exhibit distinct round eyes and a facial disc which aid in sound localization, but the blur obscures these details. Thus, based on the visual cues in Image B, the clarity of the face cannot be confirmed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the horizontal bars on the owl’s chest and the white spots on its wings visibly present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, despite the blur over the owl’s face, other parts of the owl's body are visible, including distinct horizontal bars on its chest and white spots on its wings. These markings are typical of many owl species and help identify them. Their presence is clear in the edited image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the owl positioned facing forward with its head slightly turned toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Even though the blurred face affects the facial recognition, the posture of the owl can be discerned. In Image B, the owl's body is positioned so that its head appears slightly turned toward the viewer, which is a common pose for illustration purposes to engage viewers. Therefore, despite facial details being indistinct, the positioning is evident.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the tree branch display a deeply ridged and layered bark texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the tree branch under the owl is clear and shows a deeply ridged and layered bark texture. Such textured appearance is characteristic of mature trees, adding to the realistic portrayal of the scene. The branch's texture remains unaltered and very detailed in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the moon located directly behind the owl, centered in the upper portion of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image illustrates a moon positioned directly behind the owl, making it appear centered in the upper portion of the image. This positioning provides a dramatic backdrop that highlights the owl and creates a focal point, a common technique in nocturnal-themed illustrations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there are leafy branches visible in the upper corners of the scene. These branches form a partial canopy around the owl, which adds depth and context to the outdoor setting, indicating a natural habitat. Their presence is clear and unaffected by any edits.",
