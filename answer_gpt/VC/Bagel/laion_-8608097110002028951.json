      "question": "Are the three large arched windows on the upper level of the building present and arranged symmetrically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible three large arched windows on the upper level of the building which are arranged symmetrically. These windows are prominent and stand out due to their size and the decorative detail around them. Symmetry in architecture involves balanced proportions which create a harmonious appearance. The arrangement here visually fits the concept of symmetry as the windows are evenly distributed across the façade.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a tall vertical black sign prominently positioned at the center top of the building. This placement tends to attract attention due to its central location, creating connectivity within the architectural design by aligning with the overall symmetry.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building maintains its decorative cornice featuring spire-like finials along the roofline. This architectural element adds aesthetic value and character, enriching the visual complexity of the façade.

      "question": "Are the Walgreens and Marina Theater signs located on the left and right sides of the ground floor respectively, with red script lettering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building features signage at the ground level. The Walgreens sign, positioned on the left, contains red script lettering which is eye-catching and commonly used for branding. On the right, though, the sign reads 'nina 77' instead of 'Marina Theater', and it also uses red script lettering. Thus, the arrangement described does not match the exact names given.",

      "question": "Are the two vintage cars positioned in front of the Walgreens and Marina Theater entrances respectively?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes vintage cars in front of the building. One car is positioned in front of the Walgreens entrance; however, the other car seems to be a stylized, toy-like purple vehicle reminiscent of a Lego model, distinct from typical vintage cars. This car is located near the space in front of the 'nina 77' entrance. Therefore, it can be interpreted that the arrangement does not accurately depict traditional vintage cars positioning.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are individuals visible near the entrances of the building. Although the sign does not identify the location as Marina Theater anymore, the people present reflect interaction or activity typically expected in such a setting. Observing the presence of people outside a business like a Walgreens is common as it indicates foot traffic.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a defined curb line and sidewalk are visible in front of the building. These are typical features of urban landscapes that accommodate pedestrian movement and separate vehicular traffic, establishing the spatial layout between the street and the building.",
