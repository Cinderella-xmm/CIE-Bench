      "question": "Is the violin clearly present under the woman’s chin, held by her left hand, with the bow drawn across the strings by her right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the woman is visibly holding the violin under her chin using her left hand, while her right hand is drawing a bow across the strings, which is the standard posture for playing a violin. The presence and positioning of the violin, as well as the bow held in her right hand, are clearly depicted, confirming the question's description.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both arms positioned correctly to support violin playing—left arm holding the instrument, right arm moving the bow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues show the left arm holding the body of the violin while the right arm is extended to move the bow across the strings. This setup matches the well-recognized posture required for violin performance, where the instrument is stabilized by the left hand and the strings are played by the right hand.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the woman have her eyes closed and a calm, focused facial expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the face is blurred and specific details about expressions cannot be assessed, the question about whether her eyes are closed or if she has a calm, focused facial expression can't be determined due to the blur. Thus, using the blurred visual information alone, it's concluded that this aspect isn't visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the woman standing upright with her body slightly angled toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From the visual stance of the woman in the edited image, she appears to be standing with an upright posture. Her body is slightly rotated or angled in a way that she faces towards the viewer, which can be inferred from the positioning of her shoulders and the front part of her dress.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the bow visibly in contact with the strings of the violin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the positioning of the bow in the woman's right hand, it is aligned as though it is being drawn across the strings of the violin. However, determining explicit contact with the strings only from the visual provided isn't distinctly evident.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the woman have long, dark hair flowing down her back and over her shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the woman does have long hair cascading down, but it's not dark; her hair is styled in a braid flowing over her shoulder and down her back. The color and styling of her hair depicted in the image do not match the description of being long and dark flowing freely.",
