      "question": "Does the illustration retain the man's original face shape and glasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the illustration, the character's face is not visible due to the blurred effect. The glasses, which were visibly worn by the man in the original image, are not present in the illustration. Typically, illustrations can simplify or alter certain features like the face shape and accessories. Hence, based on visual observation, the illustration does not retain the original face shape and glasses.",

      "question": "Is the pattern on the tie retained in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the original image, the man's tie has a distinct pattern. In the illustration, however, the man is depicted as a skateboarder, and no tie is visible. Illustrations often simplify clothing details to focus on the character and theme. Thus, the tie's pattern is not retained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the checkered pattern on the suit jacket retained in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original image shows a subtle checkered pattern on the man's suit jacket. In the illustration, the man is wearing casual clothing suitable for skateboarding, which inherently does not include a suit jacket. Thus, the illustrative style and context lead to the conclusion that the checkered pattern is not retained.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the striped dress shirt visible and consistent beneath the suit in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original image depicts the man in a striped dress shirt beneath his suit. In the illustration, the attire is casualâ€”a t-shirt for skateboarding is depicted instead of formal wear. As illustrations often adapt clothing to suit the theme, the striped shirt pattern is not retained.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the short-cropped hairstyle retained in the man's illustrated appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original image shows the man with a short-cropped hairstyle. The illustration does depict a man with a hairstyle that resembles a short-cropped style, which is typical in simplified comic art representations. Therefore, the illustrated appearance maintains the hairstyle concept.",
