      "question": "Does the plate retain its circular shape and raised rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible change where the focus is on a bowl rather than a flat plate, as seen by the curvature and depth seen under the food. The presence of a deep curve signifies a bowl, which inherently retains a circular shape and typically has a raised rim to contain its contents. This matches what's generally expected in culinary presentations.",

      "question": "Is the plate still white in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dish appears to be white, as commonly used in food presentations to provide a neutral backdrop that highlights the food itself. Bowls or plates used in such settings are often white as they do not overwhelm the dish visually. The visible portion of the bowl in Image B looks white, supporting this conclusion.",

      "question": "Does the spoon retain its metallic finish and reflective surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spoon is partially visible, showing a typical reflective surface characteristic of metal. It retains a metallic finish, as seen by the shine and how it reflects light. This is a common property of stainless steel or other metals used in cutlery.",

    {

      "question": "Is the spoon still oriented vertically on the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spoon is placed horizontally within the bowl rather than vertically. This is a common configuration when dishes are served with soup or salad to allow easy access while eating.",

      "question": "Are the plate and spoon still centrally positioned in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses on a partial top section of a bowl centered against a dark background, with emphasis on the food, rather than a central alignment of a plate. The spoon is within the bowl and not centrally aligned over the visual plane of the image. Thus, the culinary presentation in Image B does not centrally position both the dish and spoon against the entire image frame.",
