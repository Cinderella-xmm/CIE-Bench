      "question": "Does the quilt pattern retain its distinct pink, green, and white geometric and floral motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quilt pattern appears to have been altered significantly. The dominant colors now are blue, red, and yellow rather than pink, green, and white. The geometric motifs still exist, but the floral aspect has been changed to more abstract watercolor-like designs. To verify, comparison to Image A shows a clear alteration in color scheme and pattern style, confirming that the distinct original motifs have not been retained.",

      "question": "Are the two beds still placed parallel, with the nightstand positioned centrally between them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Using visual cues in Image B, the beds are clearly positioned parallel to each other with a nightstand placed centrally between them. Comparison with Image A reveals that the arrangement of beds and the nightstand is the same in both images, confirming the parallel placement.",

      "question": "Do the two framed wall art pieces remain above the respective beds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual details indicate that two framed wall art pieces are indeed positioned above each bed. Comparing with Image A, the arrangement remains consistent in terms of position above the beds, and although the images themselves may appear altered due to the watercolor effect, their placement is unchanged.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the left bed has a decorative pillow in a pink hue resembling magenta, while the right bed has a pillow in a blue shade rather than teal. Image A clearly shows the magenta and teal pillows, indicating a change in color for the right bed's pillow in Image B (from teal to blue), but retention of the general color idea for the left bed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual analysis of Image B shows a white nightstand positioned between the two beds, featuring a vase with pink flowers. This setup directly corresponds to what is observed in Image A, preserving the presence of the nightstand and floral decoration without changes.",
