      "question": "Is there a visible gular pouch located beneath the lower mandible of the beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction is a stylized cartoon pelican, which simplifies many of the anatomical details seen in a real pelican. The beak is represented with exaggerated features and bright colors, but there is no distinct gular pouch visible beneath the lower mandible. Typically, a gular pouch would be represented as an elongated area beneath the beak, but the edited image focuses more on simplifying the overall form for aesthetic purposes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the feet clearly webbed with visible claws at the tips of each toe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican is depicted with simplistic pink feet that lack the detailed anatomy seen in a real pelican's feet, such as webbing or claws. The feet here are cartoonish and rounded, adhering to a style that omits specific animal anatomical features for broader appeal and simplicity.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the feathers on the body composed of layered, striated structures with visible individual feather shafts and overlapping edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican is illustrated with smooth, stylized coloration representing its wings and body feathers. Rather than individual feather structures or shafts, the design focuses on blocks of color to suggest feathers without detailing their natural appearance, typical of simplified cartoon art.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bird have a long neck curving down from the head to a broad, rounded body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a cartoon pelican with exaggerated proportions, including a curved neck leading to a rounded body. These features are stylized and simplified to enhance the character's cute and approachable appearance while retaining the general pelican shape.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are both legs positioned under the body, supporting the pelican in a grounded standing pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoon pelican in Image B is illustrated with legs positioned to give the impression of standing, as implied by design elements suggesting grounding, although the exact anatomical detail of legs under the body like in Image A is minimized for simplicity.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a single dark, round eye visible on the side of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the pelican with large, cartoon-style eyes that are simplified into a rounded shape with dark pupils. Such exaggeration is a common feature in cartooning to emphasize characteristics like expressiveness and personality while retaining recognizable pelican features.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a small tuft of feathers raised at the crown of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoon pelican in Image B does not have distinct tufts of feathers at the crown of the head. The design uses a smooth top head with a blue cap, omitting detailed feather representation in favor of stylizing accessories and elements that contribute to a playful character look.",
