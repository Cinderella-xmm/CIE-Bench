      "question": "Are the eyes almond-shaped with a downward gaze, maintaining their original proportion and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes are not visible due to the blurred portion, but observing the chibi style generally includes large and exaggerated features. The common chibi style would depict eyes that are not necessarily almond-shaped, but due to image edit restrictions, it's indeterminable. Therefore, due to lack of visible cues in Image B, the answer is No.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the nose present with a visible bridge and tip, positioned centrally between the eyes and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nose is not visible due to the blurred portion. In chibi or figurative depictions, facial features may often be simplified or stylized, typically not matching the realistic portrayal or proportions of the original image. Thus, without visual evidence of a nose, it cannot be concluded that these details are present.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the mouth have a subtle upward curve at the corners, forming a gentle smile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a blurred face, so no mouth detail is available. However, chibi designs often simplify features, which might feature exaggerated smiles. Due to the blur, no specific mouth detail can be determined or described.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the subject seated cross-legged with knees bent and body leaning forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figure appears to be depicted in a seated posture, but it is not cross-legged. Instead, the figure seems to be standing or kneeling with no clear depiction of bent knees or a leaning forward posture. The artistic style presents a compact figurine rather than a detailed human-like pose as seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a small gold stud earring visible in the left ear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features what appears to be a decorative hanging earring as part of the chibi's design, consistent with the stylization and not a small gold stud. The presence of large and floral decorative patterns means that the earrings do not match the description of a small gold stud.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the skin tone light to medium with natural undertones, consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a chibi figure with skin that is typically lighter in tone due to the figurative art style and decoration, differing from Image A's natural human skin. Without realistic details or tones due to the stylistic difference in representation, it is not consistent with the original image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the head tilted downward with the gaze directed forward and slightly down?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the style and blurred face, the exact orientation of gaze and head tilt cannot be precisely determined. Typically, a chibi figure does maintain a straightforward pose for balance, missing cues on tilt direction. Without precise visual confirmation, it's impractical to ascertain this head posture.",
