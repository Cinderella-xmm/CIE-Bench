      "question": "Does the edited image retain a central object resembling a monitor, even in a stylized form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a central object is present that closely resembles a computer monitor. It is positioned centrally and maintains the typical rectangular shape of a monitor, with an apparent display screen and stand. This form is consistent with common perceptions of a monitor even if it is part of a stylized setup, staying true to the primary form seen in computer setups.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the edited image include an object resembling a speaker, even in a stylized form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features two objects on either side of the monitor that resemble speakers. Their designs are akin to common speaker structures, with circular elements indicative of speaker cones. These objects mimic traditional speaker components, suggesting they hold a similar role in the setup, even in a stylized manner.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image include an object resembling a computer tower, even in a stylized form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no distinct object that resembles a computer tower based on traditional or stylized representation usually seen alongside a monitor. The emphasis is solely on the monitor, keyboard, mouse, and speakers, with no vertical rectangular shape that would hint towards the presence of a tower.",
      "weight": 1,

      "question": "Does the edited image include an object resembling a keyboard, even in a stylized form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, directly in front of the monitor, is an object that adheres to the typical elongated, rectangular form of a standard keyboard. This suggests it is a stylized representation of a keyboard, consistent with its expected placement and geometrical structure in a computing environment.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, next to the stylized keyboard, there is a small object with a recognizable shape analogous to that of a computer mouse. It has the smooth, rounded form commonly associated with a mouse, confirming its inclusion even in a stylized form.",
