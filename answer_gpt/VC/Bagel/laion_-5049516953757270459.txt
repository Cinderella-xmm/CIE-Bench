    "Question": "Q1: Is the overall shape of the food arrangement a perfect heart?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of Lego pieces forms a rough heart shape. The pieces are organized to suggest a heart but lack the smooth, symmetrical curves of a perfect heart due to the angular and jagged edges of the Lego pieces. Commonly, a perfect heart shape is smooth and symmetrical, which is not fully achieved with the Lego format.",
    "answer": "No"
