    "Question": "Q1: Is the dancer’s left leg extended vertically upward in a full arabesque, with the right foot en pointe?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain depicts a cartoon representation of a dancer with her left leg extended vertically upward, resembling a full arabesque. Commonly, this position involves one foot being en pointe, which is illustrated by the position of the right foot. Artistic simplification can represent ballet poses, so the representation aligns with the arabesque position. In Image A, the dancer's left leg was also extended vertically upward with the right foot en pointe, confirming Image B's accurate portrayal.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are both feet wearing pink pointe shoes with visible ribbons wrapped around the ankles?",

    "explanation": "The cartoon dancer in Image B is shown wearing a sleeveless pink outfit akin to a leotard, frequent in ballet costumes. The tight fit is implied by the close representation of form. White tights are indicative but not depicted explicitly due to artistic simplification.

    "Question": "Q5: Is one arm extended forward and slightly out to the side, while the other grips the barre?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the dancer’s arm positions: one seemingly extended forward and outwards, and the other bent upward, possibly gripping an imagined barre-like element considering realistic ballet postures.
