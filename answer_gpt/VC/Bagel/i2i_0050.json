      "question": "Does the image retain the sandy beach with grassy patches where the skater moves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the three silhouettes represent a human figure in the motion of skating or gliding, depicted as a sequence of action without detail. The ground on which they are set does not show detailed environmental elements like sand or grass. The silhouettes and stylized lines imply motion but do not provide detail about the specific ground surface. Hence, no granular details are visible like sandy or grassy textures.",
