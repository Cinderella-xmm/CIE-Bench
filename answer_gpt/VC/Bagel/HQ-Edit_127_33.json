      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fountain is the focal point and appears to be centrally located within the garden. The surrounding garden layout and pathway symmetry align with the fountain, indicating a central position. This is a common design feature in formal garden settings where fountains serve as central decorative elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of hedges and flowerbeds around the fountain appears to be symmetrical, with evenly distributed shapes and colors forming a balanced design. This radial symmetry is typical in formal gardens where the fountain is centrally located, and the surrounding elements are organized symmetrically. This visual symmetry can be assessed from the use of color and hedge shapes.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the far end of the central path aligned with the position of the fountain, there is a visible arched gateway. This alignment suggests an intentional design for garden access, enhancing the visual transition from the entrance to the central focal point, such as a fountain.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beyond the garden wall, traditional houses with thatched roofs and chimneys can be seen in the distant background. This enhances the scenic and pastoral view typical of country gardens. The visual cues of roof shape, chimney stacks, and distance perspective contribute to recognizing these traditional architectural features.",
