      "question": "Is the mustache present with its original shape, including upward curls at the ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial area is blurred, so specific details about any mustache, including its shape or presence, cannot be discerned. World knowledge indicates that such blurring prevents any visual analysis of facial features.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial area in Image B is blurred, obscuring all facial features, including the eyes and nose. Thus, it's not possible to determine the symmetry or position of these features.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blurring extends to the forehead area, making it impossible to visibly assess the hairline or its pattern.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B visually shows a bow tie at the center of the neck area. The symmetrical design and knot positioning beneath the collar suggests adherence to traditional bow tie placement through their vivid colors and patterns.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the text 'S. W. Kramer.' is positioned below the image. The font and positioning appear consistent between the images, indicating that this element remains unchanged in the edit.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the blurring, the shoulders and body position in Image B suggest that the head is slightly turned to the left while the body faces forward, consistent with the typical angle for a portrait.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
