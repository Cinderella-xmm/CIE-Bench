      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the central touchscreen still positioned in the center of the dashboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the conversion to an artistic style with calligraphic strokes, the touchscreen remains in the center of the dashboard. This conclusion is drawn by identifying the rectangular shape and positioning of the touchscreen as typically found in vehicle interiors, supported by common knowledge of car design conventions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dashboard retain its general structure and placement relative to the steering wheel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the general layout of a vehicle interior. Despite the stylized nature of Image B, the dashboard appears to maintain similar proportions and placement in relation to the track-like shape where the steering wheel typically resides, indicating retained structure.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the steering wheel still partially visible on the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the presence of a shape resembling a steering wheel can be detected on the left side, consistent with its typical position in vehicle interiors. This outlines its retention as partially visible, despite the artistic alteration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the overall spatial arrangement of the vehicle's interior remain consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the calligraphic transformation, Image B's elements such as the central touchscreen, dashboard, and steering wheel appear to retain their relative positions within the vehicle interior, indicating that the spatial arrangement remains consistent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the airflow graphics on the screen still discernible, even if represented through calligraphic strokes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the conversion to calligraphic representation alters the details on the screen, making the original airflow graphics unrecognizable. The strokes do not depict the original flow paths that would be visible in standard representation.",
