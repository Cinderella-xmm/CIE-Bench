    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there exactly one tree positioned in the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, there is a singular, stylized tree located centrally within the stained glass design. The tree stands out as the major focal point, a common theme in such geometric and symbolic designs. Given the layout and symmetry inherent in stained glass art, this conclusion is supported by visual organization and design style knowledge.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the tree have a clearly defined layered canopy structure with multiple horizontal tiers of foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tree in Image B is stylized in a geometric form, typical of stained glass art. Instead of realistic foliage, it features a simplified, abstract representation, which lacks clearly defined layered or tiered foliage that would resemble a natural tree's horizontal canopy structure. The art focuses on a minimalistic approach.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the tree positioned in front of the mountain range in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the tree as the central object in front of geometric shapes that represent mountains. The placement suggests the tree is in front, aligning with the typical foreground-background narrative in art composition, supported by its prominent, central position compared to the other elements.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible shadow extending from the base of the tree onto the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree is presented with strong lines and shapes typical of stained glass, but lacks realistic elements such as shadows due to the abstract nature of the art style which focuses on a symbolic and geometric portrayal of objects rather than realistic lighting effects.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a flat grassy plain beneath the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a realistic grassy plain; rather, it uses geometric shapes to suggest landscape features. The area below the tree consists of colored sections typical of stained glass work, reflecting an abstract interpretation rather than a direct depiction of grass or plains.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there mountains visible in the background behind the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, geometric shapes designed to resemble mountains are visible behind the tree, consistent with the artistic representation in stained glass work. The shapes are stylized and simplified, providing a symbolic visualization of a mountain range rather than a photorealistic depiction.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
