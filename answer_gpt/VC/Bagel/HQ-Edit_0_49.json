      "question": "Does the teapot retain the original curved spout with a sharply pointed tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of Image B shows a different spout design from Image A. Image B features a wider and shorter spout that lacks the sharp pointed tip seen on Image A.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
