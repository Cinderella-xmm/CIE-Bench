      "question": "Is the elephantâ€™s head with large, flared ears and visible eye clearly present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object appears as an elephant-shaped teapot with steampunk elements. The elephant's head is notable and detailed, featuring large, flared ears and a visible eye, common traits of a stylized elephant. This can be concluded by observing the distinct and clear features of the elephant head, suggesting that these elements are prominent in the design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the trunk of the elephant clearly formed into the spout of the teapot, extending upward and backward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a trunk that distinctly forms the spout of the teapot and follows an upward and backward trajectory, which is typical in designs where an elephant's trunk acts as a functional part of a teapot's aesthetic.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are four distinct legs supporting the body of the elephant-teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays an elephant-like figure with a teapot design, which typically includes core morphological elements such as legs. However, the figure appears to be under a glass dome with partial views due to its ornamental style. The legs are not clearly distinguished or separate in this image's design element.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a domed lid with a pointed finial on top of the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top part of the steampunk elephant-teapot in Image B features a domed shape with a pointed finial at its peak, a common design characteristic found in traditional teapots modified with thematic aesthetics, easily seen in the design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are floral patterns, including lotus flowers and vines, visibly engraved on the body of the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the steampunk depiction of the elephant-teapot in Image B, the focus is on gears and metallic joints. No engraving of floral patterns like lotus flowers and vines is apparent. Instead, it follows a mechanical theme.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the teapot primarily rendered in a silver metallic finish with reflective highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The teapot in Image B is rendered in a steampunk style, which often incorporates metallic finishes. However, the primary visible colors are darker with contrasting copper details rather than purely silver. Thus, while metallic, the finish would not be described as purely silver with reflective highlights.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is a matching silver cup and saucer present next to the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Adjacent to the elephant-teapot in Image B is indeed a cup. Although it appears metallic, matching the steampunk aesthetic, the cup follows consistency in design rather than specifically matching a 'silver' finish as seen in material design. Component colors are more in line with the steampunk palette rather than a plain silver style.",
