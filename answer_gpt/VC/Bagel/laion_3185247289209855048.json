    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes green in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes are not visible due to the design where the faces are presented in a stylized or abstract form without detailed features. The focus in the edited image is on hair and accessories, not facial details like eye color.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the lipstick applied in a rich red shade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Similar to the previous answer, the faces in the edited image do not display specific features such as lipstick. These figures are artistic and lack detailed representation of makeup.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the subject looking upward and toward the upper left of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the chibi keychain designs do not display specific eye direction because the faces lack these elements, making it impossible to determine where the subject is looking.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the left shoulder bare and visible in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi style keychains depict head and shoulders in a simplified form, which does not resemble a realistic bare shoulder as seen in traditional portraits.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a pinkish, textured material partially visible near the lower left edge of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the chibi keychains have stylized elements, there is no indication of textured material like fur in the designs. The emphasis is on the hair and face outline.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there soft highlights on the cheekbones and jawline created by directional lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the stylized nature of the figures in the edited image, there are no realistic highlights or shadows like those that would be seen in a lifelike image highlighting cheekbones or jawlines.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the facial features symmetrically aligned with balanced spacing between the eyes, nose, and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figures in the edited image do not have defined facial features; hence, symmetry concerning alignment of eyes, nose, and mouth isn't applicable here.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
