      "question": "Is the grid of yellow rounded domes covering the surface of the cake present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is a comic strip featuring a character with a strawberry on its head and a yellow body, which is anthropomorphized as opposed to the static cake in Image A. Given this context, the grid of yellow rounded domes covering the cake is not visually present. The anthropomorphized cake character does not imply the presence of a grid of yellow domes as it is presented in a different format (comic strip).",

      "question": "Are there small red dots on top of each yellow dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a comic character resembling a cake but with facial expressions and a strawberry on its head. In this artistic depiction, the focus is not on detailing the cake’s surface as visualized in Image A. Therefore, the specific feature of small red dots on each yellow dome is not present in the comic style depiction as each red strawberry and dot are part of character's design, not the domes feature as seen on a cake.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cross-section showing a golden sponge base, white cream layer, and deep red jam layer visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction is a comic character format with no emphasis on realistic or detailed cross-section views as found in Image A. These layers are not featured because the comic illustration maintains a simplified and stylized appearance rather than displaying intricate details like cross-section layers.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are two strawberries with green leaves positioned at the top center of the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B provides a stylized comic version focusing on a singular character. This character has a single strawberry positioned on its 'head', differentiating from Image A which showcases two strawberries at the top center of the cake. Therefore, the presence of two strawberries atop is not supported by the cartoon format.",
      "weight": 3,

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are chopped nuts visible around the base of the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a comic character where such small, realistic details like chopped nuts around the base are omitted to suit the comic’s focus on simplicity and characterization, unlike Image A. Thus, chopped nuts are not depicted.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the cake maintain a square shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the represented figure is a cartoon character which does not adhere to depicting the structural shape of an actual cake from Image A. The shape in Image B is not clear or detailed enough to determine traditional cake forms like the square shape observed in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the cake placed on a silver-toned plate with an embossed floral pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, being a comic representation focused on a cartoon version of a cake slice character, there is no depiction of an accompanying plate or such intricate details as found in Image A. The environment and background are abstract and not focused on the cake’s placement or base.",

      "question": "Is the deep red jam layer clearly visible between the white cream and golden sponge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks detailed representation of any cross-sectional features of a cake given its stylized, simplified comic strip format. Focus is on the cake character’s expression, so the visibility of a deep red jam layer between the other layers is absent.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the comic representation in Image B, details important to a cross-sectional depiction like in Image A are not conveyed. The shifted artistic focus in Image B to a character means the white cream layer visual nuance between these elements is not present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q10",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B presents a personalized and cartoon figure, it eliminates a direct observability of such intricate cake composition details as a golden sponge base layer seen in Image A. It’s an artistic divergence from literal illustration.",
