    "Question": "Q1: Is the clock face present on the upper section of the left bell tower?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the left bell tower's upper section does not show a discernible clock face, as it appears to be part of a miniature or a diorama, which often lacks detailed elements found in real-life architecture. Normally, clock faces are large and prominent features on tower sections designed for them. Thus, based on the representation of Image B, the clock face is absent.",
