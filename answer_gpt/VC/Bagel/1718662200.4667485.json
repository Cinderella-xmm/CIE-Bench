      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pig in Image B is illustrated in a cartoonish style, with its snout clearly depicted.

      "question": "Are the pig’s ears large, upright, and pink with visible inner ear details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pig in Image B has ears that are large and upright, which are common traits for pig cartoon illustrations. The ears are pink, matching the typical color of pigs, and they show some detail suggesting inner ear features. This aligns with the common cartoon depiction where certain animal traits are exaggerated, such as large ears, for clarity and styling purposes.",

      "question": "Are the sunglasses red in color with round lenses and a thin frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig is wearing sunglasses that are green with round lenses and a thin frame. The color is different from the red sunglasses seen in Image A. Cartoon depictions often change accessory colors for stylistic reasons or to match the overall aesthetic. In this case, the vibrant green complements the colorful background in the cartoon style.",

      "question": "Is there a black turntable with a silver platter, tonearm, and mixer controls beneath the pig’s hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a simplified depiction of a turntable beneath the pig’s hands. It is rectangular and features controls, but lacks the detailed elements such as a silver platter and tonearm visible in Image A. Cartoon images usually simplify or stylize certain objects to fit the overall art style, focusing on key recognizable features but omitting intricate details.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the headphones are absent from around the pig's neck. This feature may be simplified or omitted in cartoon illustrations to keep the focus on certain elements, like facial expressions or main accessories. The absence of certain details is common in cartoon art where extra elements are removed for a clearer, more engaging visual.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pig in Image B does wear a red short-sleeved shirt with a visible collar and sleeves. This matches the outfit seen in the original image, with minor changes in style to suit the cartoon look. Simple features such as clothing are typically retained to maintain continuity of character depiction across different styles.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig’s front hooves are depicted as being placed on the turntable controls. However, the turntable platter is not distinctly visible, and the cartoon style simplifies the objects to highlight the pig's interaction with the DJ equipment. Cartoon illustrations often emphasize action or context through exaggerated placements and interactions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig’s skin is pink but lacks the detailed texture, subtle wrinkles, and light reflection that one would observe in more realistic images. Cartoon art typically uses flat colors and stylized shading without intricate texture details to achieve a playful, simplified look suited for entertainment or storytelling.",
