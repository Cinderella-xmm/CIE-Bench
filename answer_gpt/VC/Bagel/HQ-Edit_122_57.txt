    "Question": "Q1: Is the vase's overall shape preserved, including its three-panel body, twin scrolled handles, and flared neck?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is a crystalline structure with intricate designs. It does not have a three-panel body or twin scrolled handles, nor is there a flared neck visible in the typical sense. Instead, it features faceted shapes of various colors at the top and smooth crystal engravings resembling foliage patterns. Therefore, the overall shape is quite different from the classical style described.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the bouquet extend beyond the rim of the vase, creating an overflowing effect?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the vase has a structured crystal design with stylized, faceted floral forms extending from it. These forms are part of the vase itself and do not present the appearance of a traditional bouquet extending beyond the rim. They are intricately carved as an integral part of the vase rather than appearing as a separate bouquet overflowing outwards.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there scattered flowers on the surface of the pedestal, including at least one pink poppy and blue blooms?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a finely crafted crystal vase without any real or artificial flowers physically scattered nearby. There is a reflective pedestal under the vase, but it doesn't include scattered flowers like pink poppies or blue blooms that would indicate a state of disarray.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the vase positioned centrally on the pedestal within the frame?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is symmetrically placed on what appears to be a reflective surface, taking a central position within the frame. The positioning suggests an intentional focus on the vase itself, directly aligning it with the central axis of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do some of the flowers rest directly on the surface of the pedestal, separate from the main bouquet?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no separate flowers resting on the pedestal surface. The flowers in this image are integrally designed within the vase structure itself, through carved crystal forms, and do not appear independently on the pedestal.",
    "answer": "No"
