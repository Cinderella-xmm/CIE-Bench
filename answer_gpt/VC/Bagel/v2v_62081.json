      "question": "Is the portrait of the gentleman contained within an oval shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gentleman's portrait is indeed enclosed within an oval shape, which is a common style for classical portraits. This can be verified by observing that the watercolor drawing follows an oval boundary, surrounding the subject's head and shoulders. ",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the gentleman depicted in profile, facing toward the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual information in Image B shows the gentleman in profile, as only one side of the head is visible. The direction the profile faces is to the left side of the image since the ear and neck's curve suggest this orientation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the gentleman appears to have a necktie styled like a cravat around his neck. This is indicated by the decorative bow shape visible below the chin, characteristic of a cravat in traditional attire.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair is visibly dark and styled in a way that suggests sideburns extending from the temples. However, a mustache is not visible. Therefore, while the dark hair and sideburns are present, the absence of a mustache makes this statement incorrect.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the features such as the nose and jawline should be partially obscured since the portrait is drawn in profile. The eye is not visible either due to the blurring. Generally, these features would not be visible on the right side of his face due to the viewing perspective and face blurring.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any visible rectangular frame surrounding the oval portrait; it simply appears on a plain background. In contrast, Image A shows a rectangular frame, which signifies the absence of a frame in the edited image.",
