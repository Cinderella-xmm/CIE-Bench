        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible golden spherical knocker at the center of the door. Instead, the door has been transformed into an artistic representation resembling an owl with a crown, incorporating various ornamental elements. This suggests that the original knocker has been replaced or obscured by the new design elements.",
