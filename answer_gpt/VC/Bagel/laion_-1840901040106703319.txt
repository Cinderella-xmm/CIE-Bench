    "Question": "Q1: Are the three triangular windows positioned at the apex of the A-frame roof clearly present and maintaining their triangular shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a surreal structure made entirely of crystalline material, which does not feature any traditional architectural elements such as windows, let alone triangular ones. Image A has triangular windows at the apex of the A-frame roof typical of cabin designs. Image B replaces all original architectural elements with geometric crystal shapes, none of which resemble a cabin roof or its windows.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the cabin structured with a raised deck on the upper level and a garage on the lower level, maintaining the same vertical separation?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases a crystal structure that does not feature a raised deck or a garage level. In Image A, the cabin is clearly divided vertically into a deck level above and a garage level below, a typical architectural style. Image B has a completely different aesthetic, removing all cabin-like characteristics.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the garage door located on the right side of the lower level, adjacent to the main entrance?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not depict any garage door or main entrance. Instead, it introduces a crystalline geometric formation, different from any cabin architectural element. In Image A, the garage door is visible on the lower level's right side adjacent to the main entrance. Thus, Image B does not maintain this feature.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the cabin symmetric about its central vertical axis, with the roof peak, main entrance, and supporting columns aligned centrally?",
    "explanation": "The structure in Image B has asymmetrical crystalline facets, devoid of traditional architectural elements like a roof peak, main entrance, or supporting columns. Image A’s cabin has symmetry with its architectural elements centrally aligned. Image B completely reimagines the cabin structure without symmetry about a central vertical axis in the traditional sense.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the vertical support columns beneath the deck present and positioned at regular intervals along the front facade?",
    "explanation": "Image B lacks any deck or support columns, instead being composed of crystal forms. In Image A, vertical support columns are visible and distributed evenly. Image B does not retain this arrangement as it redefines the structure entirely without such architectural components.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the small rectangular window located on the lower level, to the left of the main entrance, still present?",
    "explanation": "Image B is a depiction of a complex crystalline structure without conventional building features like windows or entrances. Image A includes this window on the lower level of the cabin. Image B’s transformation does not retain these features or placements.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the stone retaining wall made of large, irregular boulders visible on the right side of the cabin's base?",
    "explanation": "Image B replaces natural elements and structures with crystal-like formations, entirely removing the stone retaining wall seen in Image A. Image A’s design includes a stone wall made of boulders beside the cabin base. Image B does not depict such traditional elements.",
    "answer": "No"
