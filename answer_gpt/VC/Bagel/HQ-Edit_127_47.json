    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there exactly five ducklings swimming in the foreground of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two orange duck figures floating on the water within the snow globe. These figures are easily countable at first glance due to their distinct color and size difference from their surroundings inside the snow globe.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the ducklings have their heads above water and bodies partially submerged, indicating swimming motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the duck figures are entirely visible above the water surface, appearing more as stationary toys floating rather than real ducklings swimming with heads above water and bodies partially submerged.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the bed of smooth, rounded stones clearly visible beneath the water surface in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not have water that with visible stones beneath it. The surface inside the snow globe is represented as a solid base supporting the elements like animals and trees, rather than a true water surface, therefore, stones under water cannot be seen here.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the reflection of the evergreen trees and sky clearly visible on the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a snow globe with a stylized depiction of a landscape where reflections are not present as expected in natural scenery since it's more of a miniature model within a glass ball.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are tall evergreen trees densely arranged along both sides of the lake, forming a natural corridor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, inside the snow globe, there are several small, stylized evergreen trees placed sparsely rather than densely forming natural corridors as tall as those in a real-life forest setting.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is a mist-covered mountain range visible in the background beyond the lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the background landscape inside the snow globe does not include a mist-covered mountain range. Rather, it shows a simple and miniaturized depiction with some trees and rocks, typical of decorative items like snow globes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors of the scene green (trees), blue-green (water), and brown (rocks)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe features dominantly green trees, a bright blue water representation, and a wooden brown base. This color scheme aligns with the general perception mentioned in the question about green for trees, blue for water, and brown being represented by the base rather than rocks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
