      "question": "Is the Coca-Cola bottle present in the advertisement with its distinctive curved shape and visible partial logo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the Coca-Cola bottle appears as part of the background made to resemble a combination of noir style comic strip elements. The distinctive curved shape of the bottle along with a part of the logo can be identified by its placement near the woman's profile, aligning with typical branding. Despite the stylistic changes, these elements remain discernible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the woman has earbud-like elements associated with the noir cartoon style but these are abstracted, and she doesn't display an earbud with a distinct white wire extending downward as seen in Image A.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the edited illustration (Image B), although the elements regarding hand gestures might mimic earbud interaction, the artistic style modifies the details like earbud handling, deviating from direct mimicry visible in the original image setup.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top-right corner's portrayal aligns with noir stylization, but does not visually imply tearing or peeling observed in Image A. The comic interpretation maintains an integrated structure without displaying damage.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

        "No"
      ],
