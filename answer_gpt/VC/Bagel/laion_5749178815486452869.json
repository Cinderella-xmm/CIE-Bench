      "question": "Does the open umbrella retain its circular canopy shape with visible radial ribs converging at a central hub?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an open umbrella with a circular canopy shape. One can visibly observe radial ribs that converge at a central hub, which is typical for many umbrella designs where metal or plastic ribs extend from a central point to maintain the umbrella's shape. This structure provides stability and is evident in the edited image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a closed umbrella is visible in the lower left corner featuring a black casing. This casing usually protects the umbrella's structure when closed. The wrist strap and metallic tip are common components for closure and handling, both present in Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background does not feature a starlit sky with stars and nebulae. Instead, it showcases a bright blue sky with small dots likely representing stars. There is no detailed nebulae as seen in a typical cosmic depiction.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene composition is different; it features an apple and small floral elements on a floating platform as the main focus. The background is simply a blue sky with small decorative stars. There is no hill or typical foreground, midground, and background composition as implied in the question.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, it features an open umbrella with visible black support ribs extending from the central hub to the canopy edges. It's typical that the ribs provide structural integrity to the umbrella, commonly found in its circular design.",

The edit takes a more surreal direction, deviating from realistic floral depictions.",
