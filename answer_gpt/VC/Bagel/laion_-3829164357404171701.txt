    "Question": "Q2: Is the white artificial flower still visible and centered within the large gray ribbon bow?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a completely altered object, an owl-like figure, with no visible bow or flower elements that were central in Image A. The transformation into an owl-like structure means the white artificial flower within the large gray ribbon bow is absent in Image B.",
