    "Question": "Q1: Is the overall bombe (curved, outward-bulging) silhouette of the commode preserved in the LEGO version?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO version is more blocky due to the nature of LEGO pieces, which makes it difficult to create smooth, curved surfaces. The overall shape attempts to mimic the bombe style but lacks the subtle curves and outward bulging of the original piece.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there exactly two drawers stacked vertically on the front of the dresser, each framed by brass mounts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO construction suggests compartments but does not explicitly display two distinct drawers with frames replicating brass mounts. The design is simplified and doesn't capture the detailed features of the original.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the herringbone and starburst marquetry pattern visible on the front of both drawers in the LEGO version?",
    "explanation": "The LEGO version in Image B does not show detailed patterns such as herringbone or starburst marquetry. LEGOs are limited in showing intricate details and patterns due to their uniform size and color adjustments. The original marquetry requires different materials, colors, and techniques that LEGO bricks cannot represent.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the ornate brass mounts with acanthus leaf scrolls present around the edges of both drawers and along the side panels?",
    "explanation": "Image B, the LEGO version does not include intricately designed brass mounts; instead, it uses plain LEGO bricks that do not allow for such detailed, ornate patterns.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the legs curve outward in a cabriole fashion and terminate in brass sabots?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the legs are formed by stacking LEGO pieces and do not exhibit the elegant curve of cabriole legs. They have a straight, blocky appearance, and there are no identifiable brass sabots.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a scalloped apron below the drawers, following the curve of the bombe shape?",
    "explanation": "In the LEGO version represented in Image B, there is no scalloped apron. The blocky nature of LEGO bricks prevents the creation of smooth, flowing curves required for a scalloped design.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the top surface rectangular and flush with the upper edge of the dresser body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the top surface of the LEGO model appears flat and extends slightly beyond the body. It broadly mimics the shape but may not align perfectly due to the limitations of using LEGO pieces.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Are the decorative elements (brass mounts, marquetry, legs) symmetrically arranged on both sides of the dresser?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO dresser lacks the detailed decorative elements found in Image A. The style and execution of LEGO do not allow for symmetrical intricacy, so the ornaments and designs present in the original are not represented.",
    "answer": "No"
