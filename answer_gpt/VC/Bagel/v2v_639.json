      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the giraffe retain its distinctive brown patches outlined in cream?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffe shows characteristic brown patches with cream outlines, which are typical for giraffes. This pattern is replicated in a realistic manner on the toy, suggesting the designer intended to maintain the giraffe's natural appearance in the miniaturized version.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the person depicted with extended hands toward the giraffe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lego figure representing the person is static with arms at the sides, consistent with traditional lego figures, unlike Image A where the person has extended hands towards the giraffe. This reflects the limitations of the lego format, which doesn't typically allow for dynamic postures.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the person and giraffe positioned close together, maintaining their original relative distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person and giraffe figures are positioned closely within a display case, suggesting an arrangement intended to maintain proximity. Comparing with Image A, where the person and giraffe are also close, Image B preserves this closeness within the constraints of a display format.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Does the giraffe retain its long neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the lego-style giraffe maintaining the traditionally elongated neck, a core characteristic of real and toy giraffes alike, fundamental to its recognizable silhouette.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lego figure representing the person is dressed in a light blue uniform, which is consistent with Image A where the person also wears a similar uniform. The adaptation into lego maintains the color while simplifying the details.",
