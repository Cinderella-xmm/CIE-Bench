    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the golden tufted grasses clustered around the base of the cactus still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), I observe a creature with a detailed, vibrant design featuring multiple tendrils and colorful elements, similar to what might be described as alien vegetation. This does not resemble golden tufted grasses clustered around a cactus, which would appear as small, dry, yellowish plants typical of desert environments. Therefore, the golden tufted grasses are not present in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the blue-gray succulent plants visible at the base of the cactus in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows no sign of typical desert plants like blue-gray succulents. Instead, it features a creature with exotic, alien-like features that do not resemble any form of natural desert vegetation. As such, blue-gray succulents are absent in the edited image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the sandy ground with visible pebbles and soil texture still present beneath the cactus in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a completely different scene from a cactus setting. It features a base that appears more like an alien creature rather than a natural sandy ground with pebbles. There is no sandy soil texture or pebbles visible, indicating a complete transformation from the original desert environment.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the reddish-brown rolling hills visible in the background behind the cactus in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of the edited image appears out of focus and does not resemble the reddish-brown rolling hills that were present behind the cactus in the original image. Instead, there is a simpler, less defined landscape that suggests a fantastical environment rather than a realistic desert scene.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sky gradient from pale blue near the horizon to deeper blue overhead still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the edited image does feature a gradient sky, the context and surrounding elements differ significantly. However, the general transition from a lighter to darker shade is present, albeit not necessarily replicating the naturalistic gradient observed in desert scenes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the shadow of the cactus cast directly beneath it, aligned with the direction of midday sunlight, in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not feature a cactus, and consequently, there is no shadow cast beneath it as you would expect from a tall, sunlit plant. Instead, shadows are cast from the new central figure in the image, which is the fantastical creature, not from a cactus.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the upright, multi-armed silhouette of the cactus with a central trunk and multiple upward arms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image has transformed the original upright cactus into a creature with tentacle-like appendages. While it may appear multi-armed, the overall form and purpose deviate from a cactus structure. There is no central trunk akin to a cactus with multiple upward arms.",
