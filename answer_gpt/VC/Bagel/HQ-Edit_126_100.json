      "question": "Is the child still seated on the edge of the path near the water container, facing away from the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of a realistic rural setting, we see a fantastical treehouse with legs, and no sign of a child sitting on the path exists. The child from Image A near the water container is absent. Thus, using my world knowledge, the fantastical scene doesn't depict the same elements as the rural scene in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the curved concrete path extend from the bottom right corner of the image toward the house without deviation or interruption?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a whimsical treehouse with no visible concrete path like in Image A. The path in Image A moves smoothly toward the house, but Image B lacks any human-made paths due to its fantastical nature. The brushwork and surreal elements in Image B replace grounded, realistic features.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a smaller building with a rusted corrugated metal roof visible to the left of the main house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surrealistic artwork of the treehouse does not include surrounding structures typical of a village setting, such as the smaller building with a rusted roof seen in Image A. The design focuses on the fantasy structure without depicting additional buildings that fit a realistic setting.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the large green banana leaves and the cluster of bright orange flowers clearly visible in the foreground, just below the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure does not exhibit a setting that would naturally have banana leaves or orange flowers nearby like in the original Image A, where such flora is prominent. Instead, Image B is stylized with fantasy elements, lacking typical botanical features from Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the satellite dish located on the right side of the upper floor, extending outward from the structure on a black metal pole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses on an imaginative design lacking technology such as a satellite dish seen in Image A. Image A contains such realistic details to support its traditional rural setting, whereas Image B emphasizes whimsical and fantastical artistry void of these elements.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the lower ends of the stilts firmly planted in the soil along the slope beneath the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image A utilizes traditional stilts for the house firmly planted in the soil, Image B suggests a fantasy where the structure resembles a tree with branch-like legs not firmly planted in the ground as they don't appear to touch the soil in a realistic way, thus altering the look from Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the background composed of rolling green hills covered in dense forest, fading into mist under a partly cloudy blue sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a fantastical setting without the rolling green hills and realistic mist found in Image A. Instead, the background complements the surreal theme of Image B, using artistic fog and dream-like qualities, rather than the natural landscape.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there distinct clusters of bright orange flowers growing near the base of the house, adjacent to the banana plant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while orange flowers appear on top of the treehouse, there are no banana plants or clusters of flowers near the base of the structure like in Image A. The flowers in Image B contribute to the surreal fantasy aesthetic, departing from the natural setting observed in Image A.",
