      "question": "Are the sausages rendered in a reddish-brown color consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sausages are depicted in a reddish-brown color, which is typically associated with grilled sausages. This color suggests a cooked texture, complemented by grill marks to give the impression of being freshly grilled. The rendering aligns with common design choices for illustrating roasted sausages in relatable scenes like campfires.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the sausages display parallel dark grill marks along their length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sausages clearly have parallel dark grill marks. These marks are a common visual cue indicating that the sausages were cooked over a grill. The presence of these markings on each sausage suggests an intentional representation of grilled food, commonly seen in similar scenes or animations.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the sausages exhibit a glossy, reflective surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the sausages in Image B appears smooth and slightly glossy, indicative of either a cooked or synthetic look often rendered with some degree of shine for visual appeal. This effect mimics the natural gloss found on cooked sausages due to oils and fats, enhancing their realistic depiction.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there exactly three sausages present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts two chibi characters holding skewers each with a sausage at the campfire, resulting in a total of two sausages shown in this scene. This differs from typical campfire scenes where multiple sausages may be roasting simultaneously.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is each sausage attached to a metal skewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each character holds a metal skewer with a sausage attached at the end. Metal skewers are a common tool for roasting, particularly in campfires, providing a clear visual cue that the sausages are being grilled in an outdoor setting.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the sausages show slight bulging at their ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design of the sausages includes slightly bulging ends. This is consistent with how cooked sausages can appear due to expansion and internal pressure during grilling, a detail that adds authenticity to their depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there visible reflective highlights on the upper surfaces of the sausages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction in Image B shows sausages with a glossy surface, but the artificial rendering limits the visibility of detailed reflective highlights commonly seen on real-life glossy surfaces. The focus is more on a smooth texture rather than visibly distinct reflections.",
      "weight": 1,
