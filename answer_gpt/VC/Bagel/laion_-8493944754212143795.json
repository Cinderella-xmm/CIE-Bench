    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there visible sunlight reflecting off the water surface, creating bright sparkles and highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no water surface is visible. Instead, the image depicts a fantastical dragon with glowing scales and a textured background. There are no sparkles or highlights on a water surface because the focus is on the detailed rendering of the dragon.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible patches of green moss or algae on the rock surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a dragon, and there are no rock surfaces depicted. The dragonâ€™s scales have a glowing blue color, which may visually remind one of algae due to the color but is part of the dragon design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there white, foamy water at the base of the cascade and along the edges of the flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a water cascade; it shows a dragon with glowing blue scales. The background seems to be clouds and water without distinct foam details as seen near the base of a waterfall.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no rocks depicted. The image features a dragon in a fantasy setting, focusing on its form rather than any geological formations.",

      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not have any visible water flow. The background is primarily filled with the dragon, wings, and sky, rather than depicting any flowing water.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a clear contrast between the dark, wet rock surfaces and the bright, fast-moving water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) contains a visual of a dragon, which does not include rock surfaces or flowing water. The focus is on the dragon's scales and their glow, with contrast mostly between the dragon scales and background clouds.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there visible water droplets or mist suspended in the air above the falling water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict falling water with droplets or mist. Instead, it shows a dragon with visual effects around its scales, focusing on fantasy elements rather than natural water scenery.",
