      "question": "Is the capybara’s fur visibly brown with detailed texture and fine hair strands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara's fur is depicted with a stylized illustration style, meaning the texture and individual strands of hair are not as finely detailed. Instead, the fur appears to be smooth and uniform in color with less emphasis on realistic texture. Based on these observations and common knowledge of illustration styles, which often simplify textures for stylistic effect, the answer is No.",

      "question": "Are the white, shell-shaped roofs of the Sydney Opera House clearly visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Sydney Opera House is depicted in the background. The iconic shell-shaped roofs are visible with clear outlines, although not as detailed as in a realistic photo. Nevertheless, the shapes are recognizable as the Sydney Opera House due to world knowledge of its architectural design. Therefore, the answer is Yes.",

      "question": "Is the capybara wearing a blue knitted beanie with visible ribbed texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara features a blue beanie, but the illustration style does not focus on fine texture detail like ribbing typically seen in knitted materials. It is depicted more simply without detailed texture. Combining the visual cues with common understanding of illustration styles, the answer is No.",

      "question": "Is the capybara’s right paw visibly gripping the glass containing the orange-red beverage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara is holding a glass of orange-red beverage, but the depiction does not distinctly illustrate the paw's gripping motion, as it is more stylistic. The paw appears to be close to the glass but not in a detailed gripping pose, which is common in stylized illustrations. Thus, the answer is No.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara is wearing black sunglasses, but there is no visible text or brand name like “SPY” on the temple of the glasses. Illustrations often simplify or modify such details, likely for stylistic reasons. Based on these observations, the answer is No.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara’s attire includes a sleeveless knit sweater. However, the colors are simplified, showing a blue color scheme, but not distinctly gray or with a blue horizontal stripe at the bottom as described. The illustration style opts for simpler color blocks. Hence, the answer is No.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the drink features a visible blue straw and what appears to be an orange slice garnish on the rim of the glass. These elements are stylized yet consistent with illustrative approaches. Therefore, the answer is Yes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara is illustrated in a side profile facing to the left. The position of its head is somewhat turned toward the viewer, allowing most facial features to be visible. This alignment is typical in stylized portrait illustrations to engage viewer interaction and convey character expression. Hence, the answer is Yes.",
