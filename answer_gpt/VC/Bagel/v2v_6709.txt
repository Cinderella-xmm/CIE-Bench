    "Question": "Q1: Is the faceted star-shaped pattern covering the body of the perfume bottle preserved in the Lego version?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the Lego version of the perfume bottle features a pattern that mimics the star-shaped pattern of Image A. The faceted design on the clear portion of the bottle in Image A has been recreated using Lego pieces in a similar fashion in Image B. The visual translation from crystal to Lego brick captures the essence of the original pattern’s geometry.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the perfume bottle maintain its cylindrical shape with tapered sides and flat base in the Lego construction?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle appears more angular and blocky compared to the tapering cylindrical design of Image A. The Lego version employs a geometric construction typical of Lego creations, leading to a different silhouette that doesn’t adhere to the elegant, tapered form found in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the gold faceted spherical cap positioned at the top of the bottle preserved in the Lego version?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a cap that resembles the spherical shape seen in Image A. Despite the Lego construction that inherently uses sharp angles rather than smooth curves, the cap in Image B mimics the faceted design through the use of polygonal pieces, capturing the visual essence of the original spherical cap.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the spray nozzle located on the side of the bottle’s neck, with a visible mist plume extending diagonally outward, preserved in the Lego version?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the spray nozzle and mist plume have been recreated. The nozzle is positioned similarly to Image A, projecting a visible mist that extends diagonally outward, although the plume in the Lego version is styled differently to accommodate Lego's structural aesthetics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the undulating folds of the fabric background beneath the bottle preserved in form and position in the Lego version?",
    "explanation": "Image B replaces the fabric background with a base of Lego pieces rather than recreating the fabric's texture and form. The original draped style of the fabric seen in Image A is absent, substituting for a constructed Lego foundation.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the perfume bottle positioned directly on top of the fabric background, maintaining contact and alignment with the folds, in the Lego version?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle rests upon a base fabricated from Lego bricks instead of resting upon fabric folds as seen in Image A. The original contact with fabric and alignment with its folds are not preserved due to the difference in material and construction medium.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the size of the gold cap proportionally consistent with the body of the bottle in the Lego version?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the Lego cap having a proportional relationship similar to Image A's cap concerning the bottle’s body. While the proportions slightly differ due to construction material limitations, the comparative size aspect remains consistent.",
    "answer": "Yes"
