      "question": "Is the black grand piano with an open lid and visible keyboard present in the center of the stage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a silhouette representation of a grand piano on the poster, but it does not depict a physical grand piano present on a stage with an open lid or visible keyboard as Image A does. This difference is due to the nature of Image B as a poster rather than a photographic depiction of a live stage setting.",

      "question": "Is the stage floor made of polished wood with visible reflections of the piano and ambient light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a stage or a wooden floor with reflections. Instead, it shows graphical elements themed around music and performance in poster format. The focus is on conveying the event's theme rather than replicating the exact visual details of Image A.",

      "question": "Is the central dome ceiling featuring a painted fresco with floral motifs and a surrounding gilded border still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include detailed architectural elements such as a painted fresco or a gilded border that was visible in the auditorium ceiling of Image A. The poster includes stylistic elements to convey classical elegance but lacks specific architectural details.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an artistic representation of a chandelier as part of the poster's design. However, it does not show a literal chandelier suspended from a ceiling like in Image A; instead, the chandelier is part of the graphical elements of the poster.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict audience seating or arrangement as seen in Image A. It is a stylized event poster and does not feature the detailed physical arrangement of a performance space.",
