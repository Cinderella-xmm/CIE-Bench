    "Question": "Q1: Is the statue’s right hand raised in a gesture with fingers extended upward?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the statue depicted does not have any raised hands or gesture with fingers extended. Instead, the top portion of the object appears to be dome-shaped, enclosing wireframe tree models. This is different from a traditional statue holding a hand gesture. By combining this visual cue with my world knowledge of typical statues, it becomes clear that Image B is not representing a statue with a raised hand. ",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the statue have a visible beard and long hair on the head?",
    "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, it does not feature a traditional statue with a distinct head showing facial features such as a beard or long hair. Instead, Image B shows a figure on top of a structure looking more solid and smooth without detailed facial features. Thus, there is no evidence to suggest a beard or long hair as would be typically visible on a classical statue.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there clearly visible folds and drapes in the robe covering the statue’s body?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows what appears to be an enclosure rather than a traditional statue with robes. The materials depicted are smooth and do not display the common features of clothing, such as folds or drapes that a classical statue with robes would typically have. Therefore, there are no visible folds and drapes in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the year '1882' visibly inscribed on the front face of the pedestal?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible inscriptions that denote the year '1882' on the pedestal or any part of the structure. The object has more modern design elements and features, which do not include such traditional inscriptions typically found on statues.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a dark rectangular plaque affixed to the lower front section of the base?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a modern design structure with no traditional pedestal that would hold a plaque. Instead, it stands within a smooth enclosed area, and there is no dark rectangular plaque visible in the lower front section as one might expect.",    
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the statue positioned directly on top of the pedestal, aligned vertically?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the typical structure and configuration indicate that it's a unified piece rather than a statue positioned directly atop a pedestal. The object is enclosed in a dome-like structure and not aligned vertically as a separate statue on a pedestal would be.",    
    "answer": "No"
