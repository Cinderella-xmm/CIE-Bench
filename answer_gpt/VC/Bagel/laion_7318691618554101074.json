      "question": "Are there exactly eight upright objects arranged in a tight vertical cluster within the container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are clearly four upright objects with jeweled tops arranged vertically within the container, not eight. Each object has a distinct gem at the tip and is placed closely in a cluster, but the count is less than eight.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a bed of small, uniformly shaped spherical objects filling the lower portion of the container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower portion of the container is not filled with small spherical objects. Instead, there is no filling seen as the components inside do not appear to be resting on beads or similar small round objects.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no decorative band at the upper rim of the container. The rim of the glass container is plain and undecorated.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the container is transparent, which allows clear visibility of the interior contents, such as the crystal objects with jeweled tops.",

      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all visible objects are arranged vertically with their jeweled tips pointing upward, consistent with handling or storing upright sticks or wands.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there at least three distinct sizes of objects visible in the cluster (large, medium, small)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there appear to be different sizes evident in the cluster based on the size of jeweled tops. The tips have varied gem sizes, classified as large (green and blue), medium (red), and potentially small (much smaller gemstone), indicating at least three different sizes.",

      "question": "Is the container resting on a flat, horizontal surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the container is shown resting on a flat surface which appears to be a tabletop or similar, providing horizontal stability for the transparent glass object.",
