      "question": "Is the neck of the swan-shaped object still curved in an elegant S-shape, extending upward and backward from the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neck of the swan-shaped object (which is actually a bottle design) is elegantly curved in an S-shape, closely resembling the artistic depiction of a swan. The neck extends gracefully from the body in a manner typical of a swan's natural and elegant posture. This curved design evokes the traditional and graceful image of a swan's neck. Therefore, the neck maintains the elegant curvature characteristic of a swan.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the pink berry-like accents visible on the evergreen sprigs surrounding the base of the swan?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the swan-shaped bottle does not have any visible pink berry-like accents or evergreen sprigs surrounding its base. Instead, the bottle itself features a decorative design with colored elements in the lower portion but does not feature any physical adornments like those described.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a white snowflake-shaped ornament located near the base of the swan?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the swan-shaped bottle does not feature any white snowflake-shaped ornaments. The design of the bottle is more focused on the plastic and artistic representation of a swan rather than including additional external ornaments like snowflakes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the swan/bottle resting on a textured, snow-covered surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the swan-shaped bottle is not resting on a textured, snow-covered surface. Instead, it is placed on a plain, white surface with red glittery balls nearby, devoid of any snow texture. This setting is quite different from Image A, where the swan sculpture is on a snow-covered surface.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no blurred figures of people or strings of colorful, glowing lights in the background. The focus is entirely on the swan-shaped bottle against a plain, gray background, with no context of an outdoor setting or crowd.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head of the swan-shaped bottle is oriented toward the left side of the image. This follows the traditional design of a swan where the head is gracefully turned to one side, maintaining the aesthetic appeal of the object.",
