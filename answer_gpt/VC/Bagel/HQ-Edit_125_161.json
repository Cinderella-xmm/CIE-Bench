      "question": "Is the herringbone-patterned wooden floor present and accurately rendered in the same layout and orientation as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the herringbone-patterned wooden floor is visible in the same layout and orientation as Image A. The pattern of interlocking wooden planks remains consistent with what is typically recognized as a herringbone pattern. By comparing the floors seen in Images A and B, it is evident that the design has been preserved without alterations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the vertical and horizontal moldings of the wall paneling preserved, including the recessed rectangular panels and crown molding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vertical and horizontal moldings of the wall paneling, including the recessed rectangular panels and crown molding, are faithfully represented in Image B. When compared to Image A, the architectural elements on the wall remain unchanged, maintaining the same structure and detailing that define traditional wall paneling.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the oval-shaped skylight or oculus at the top of the spiral staircase still present and positioned centrally above the coil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature the oval-shaped skylight, and instead, the space above the spiral staircase houses a dragon's body, obscuring the previously seen skylight. A comparison with Image A shows the skylight is distinctly visible in A, but it is missing in B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the graphite pencil visible in the lower-right corner of the image, angled diagonally across the drawingâ€™s border?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the graphite pencil is clearly visible in the lower-right corner, just like in Image A. It maintains its position and diagonal orientation across the drawing's border, indicating no change between the images in this aspect.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the thin ruled border enclosing the entire drawing present, with short perpendicular lines at each corner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the thin ruled border surrounds the drawing, with short perpendicular lines at each corner, confirming that this aspect is unchanged.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the perspective of the scene maintain convergence toward the oval skylight at the top, with all architectural lines aligning accordingly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks the oval skylight at the top of the spiral staircase. Thus the perspective of the scene in Image B does not converge to the skylight as seen in Image A. Consequently, Image B's architecture does not follow the same perspective convergence as Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the tonal gradients on the walls and floor, particularly the darker shadows near the base and lighter areas under the skylight, preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tonal gradients of shadows are present in Image B, with darker shadows visible near the base and lighter areas indicative of light exposure. This is consistent with what Image A displays, maintaining the same shading to depict light source placement.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are the individual wooden planks of the floor rendered with fine parallel lines to indicate texture and grain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B exhibit wooden floor planks detailed with fine parallel lines representing texture and grain. This characteristic persists in Image B, showcasing the same intricacies as the original image.",
