    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the red circular insignia still present on the left lapel of the suit jacket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, analyzing the visual cues, the jacket does not appear to have any insignia or emblem on the lapel that resembles a red circular insignia. This contrasts with the conventional appearance of a suit without lapel decorations, indicating the insignia is absent.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the ear clearly visible on the left side of the head in its original anatomical position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ear is visible on the left side of the head, situated in its anatomical position. The visual cues confirm its visibility and placement, consistent with its typical human anatomy location.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the mouth open in a natural smile showing the upper row of teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the blurred face, visual information about the mouth is obscured, making it impossible to determine the presence of a natural smile or visible teeth. Thus, based on what is visible, it is assumed the mouth is not in such a position.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face is blurred, affecting the visibility of facial features like the nose. Hence, conclusions about its original shape, including the bridge and tip, can't be drawn from the available data.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the head positioned in a frontal view rather than in a three-quarter profile view. The head faces directly forward, which is typical for a portrait view.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a background that is consistently off-white without any discernible textures or additional objects. This provides a clean canvas typical in portrait photography.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears even with a soft transition visible under the chin and along the jawline, suggesting a controlled lighting environment usually achieved through frontal lighting setups.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
