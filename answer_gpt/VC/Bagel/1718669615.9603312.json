      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the presence of two parallel railway tracks extending into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a painted vase with intricate designs in geometric patterns. There is no depiction of railway tracks extending into the distance in this image. This conclusion is drawn by analyzing visual cues and recognizing that Image B's focus is on artistic pottery rather than any landscape or infrastructure.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the railway track visibly curved to the right as it recedes into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, portraying a painted vase, lacks any visible landscape or infrastructure such as railway tracks. The identifying feature is art and design with patterns, rather than any real-world elements like railway tracks. Thus, there is no visual cue of any railway track curving right or otherwise.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the UFO positioned directly above the central axis of the railway track?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given that Image B only shows a decorated vase and not an exterior environment, there are no railway tracks present, nor is there a UFO depicted. The visual cues are entirely focused on the artistic representation of a vase rather than a landscape with a railway track and UFO.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a clear horizontal line separating the sky from the land in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B consists of a painting of a vase and does not involve any elements of a landscape, such as sky or land. The background designs are abstract and artistic rather than resembling natural elements or environments. Therefore, there is no horizontal separation of sky and land.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the railway track visibly elevated above the surrounding ground level?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) has no railway track depicted. Analyzing the visual information shows only an artistic representation of a vase with geometric patterns, distinctly absent of any structural features such as an elevated railway track.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the railway tracks converge toward a single point on the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an artistic depiction of a vase with vibrant patterns, and not a landscape with railway tracks. Therefore, there are no railway tracks illustrated, nor do they converge toward any point on the horizon.",
