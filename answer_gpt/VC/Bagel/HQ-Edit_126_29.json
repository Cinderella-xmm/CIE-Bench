        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grandfather clock retains its ornate and traditional design, with the dark polished wooden casing, intricate carvings, and finish consistent with classic styling.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not clearly show the glass panel or the pendulum and weights inside the clock. Instead, there is a graphical overlay with a knife and textual elements occupying the space where the interior mechanics would be visible. The ornate design of the clock is maintained, but the internal details normally visible through the glass are obscured. Thus, based on visual cues, the interior components are not visibly present.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any part of the floor or rug due to its decorative overlay with text and other graphical elements that occupy the entire space. These elements cover any potential detailing or flooring aspects that might have been depicted, making the rug, along with its patterns, not visible.",

      "explanation": "Image B contains the fireplace mantel with its elaborately carved details and the decorative iron grate. This feature is maintained and positioned to the side of the edited scene, aligning with typical stylistic features of such images. Even with the additional elements focusing on time and decorations around, its positioning, and detailing is discernible.",
