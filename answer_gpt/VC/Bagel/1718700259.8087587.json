      "question": "Is the \"POLICE\" and \"CME\" text present on the driver’s side door in the same position and font style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image appears to depict a LEGO-style model of a police car. The text 'POLICE' and 'CME', which would be expected on a real police vehicle, is generally painted or written on the car doors. However, analyzing the LEGO model, the blocky structure doesn't show these specific texts; instead, it features a badge-like design on the side. Without clear textual markings matching 'POLICE' and 'CME', the same positioning and font style as might be seen on a realistic vehicle are unlikely.",

      "question": "Is the gold-colored badge emblem with a shield and star design located on the driver’s side door?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image is a LEGO model of a police car. This model does present a badge-like emblem on the door, albeit in LEGO brick design. It is circular and might not exactly resemble a shield with a star, but it symbolizes a police badge characteristic seen in toy renditions. The design is stylized for a toy and may not perfectly match real emblem details but attempts to mimic such a style.",

      "question": "Does the rooftop light bar have the exact red-blue-red-blue color sequence from left to right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows a LEGO model police car with a light bar on top of the roof. Notably, this light bar sequence is red-blue, alternating just once rather than duplicating the pattern due to space limitations and the simplified design of the LEGO model. The limited parts lead to a single pair (one red and one blue light) without repeating the pattern of red-blue-red-blue seen in some larger or real light bars.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO model mimics a police car's grille. The grille in LEGO styling consists of a blocky, grid pattern rather than detailed horizontal slats you might find on a real car. LEGO designs simplify such details for the sake of part limitations and ease of assembly, often sacrificing real-world accuracy for simplicity and style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO model police car in Image B does not exhibit a detailed, readable license plate with text such as 'LIP' or 'CHICAGO POLICE'. LEGO models generally do not include intricate text at such a small scale, often because the size and design don't support highly detailed additions. Instead, they focus on broader visual patterns and designs representative of the theme without the fine details.",

      "question": "Does the car maintain the four-door sedan silhouette with a long hood and trunk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the LEGO model represents a compact version of a police car. It is unlikely to portray the full silhouette of a four-door sedan with a long hood and trunk due to its toy-like nature and design limitations inherent in LEGO models. These models are often more compact and exaggerate or simplify features for ease of construction and play value rather than accurate representation.",

      "question": "Are the rectangular headlights and amber turn signals positioned symmetrically on the front fenders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the LEGO model of a police car within Image B, headlight designs are simplified into cubic or block structures, characteristic of LEGO styling. They may appear symmetrical on the front, but due to the model's design, the representation isn't precise in capturing the detail of turn signals or specific headlight placement like a real vehicle might show.",
