        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, I observe an angel-like figure with visually traditional angelic features like wings. A circular halo is typically represented as a bright or glowing ring above such figures. In this image, there seems to be a glowing circular element present above the head area, indicative of a typical halo in artistic representations of angels.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an angelic figure with large feathered wings clearly visible extending from behind and appearing to be symmetrically positioned on either side of the figure. The wings are distinctive with noticeable feathers, commonly associated with depictions of angels.",

      "question": "Does the angel have bright blue eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face in Image B is blurred, making it impossible to visibly assess any eye color. Therefore, without any visible evidence, no conclusion can be drawn about the eye color.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right hand of the figure is depicted as being positioned near the chest area. The hand location is visible and follows the traditional artistic pose often used in angel imagery, suggesting introspection or serenity.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B is depicted with long, wavy hair that appears to be a shade of golden-blonde, flowing over the shoulders and towards the back. This matches the common depiction of angelic figures with flowing hair.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is positioned slightly turned towards the viewer's left side, with the body facing slightly forward. However, due to the blurred area where the face should be, assessing the exact angle of the face's orientation becomes speculative. The visible upper body posture suggests a forward and slightly angled pose.",
