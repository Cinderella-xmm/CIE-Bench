      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the toe box of the boot rounded?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toe box of the boot features sharp angles and geometric shapes, resembling facets which give it an angular appearance. This contrasts with a traditional rounded toe, and instead suggests a more modern and stylized design with straight edges. Therefore, the toe box is not rounded.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the boot have a V-shaped opening at the top of the shaft?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a boot with a distinct V-shaped opening at the top of the shaft, which is visible as part of the angular and faceted design of the bootâ€™s top. The visual design clearly depicts a V-shape at the opening.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a continuous white piping running vertically along the outer side of the shaft from the heel to the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible continuous white piping along the outer side of the shaft. The boot's design is characterized by sharp, mirrored surfaces and geometric patterns without any piping details. The reflective and monochrome appearance does not support the existence of a continuous white piping.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are decorative patterns present on both the upper shaft and the vamp area of the boot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design of the boot in Image B is dominated by geometric shapes and facets covering the entire boot, including the upper shaft and vamp area. These could be considered decorative in a modern, artistic sense, bold and stylized, thus, decorative patterns are present in a non-traditional sense.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a distinct heel block elevating the rear of the boot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boot features a notably elevated block heel that is distinct and separate from the rest of the boot structure, clearly providing elevation at the rear part of the boot. This is apparent from the shape and the way the heel is designed into the structure.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the surface of the boot exhibit visible texture resembling leather grain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the boot in Image B does not exhibit any texture that resembles leather grain. Instead, it shows a smooth, reflective, and angular design akin to polished metal or glass surfaces. The absence of grain texture is evident in its sleek and smooth appearance.",
