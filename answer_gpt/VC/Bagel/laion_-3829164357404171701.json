    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the large dark gray ribbon bow still present and positioned on the front-left side of the bag?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object has transformed into what looks like a decorative owl-like item, with features like scales and large eyes, deviating from the original design of a bag. The large dark gray ribbon bow that was on the front-left side in Image A is no longer visible; instead, there are exaggerated features resembling owl eyes. This indicates a significant transformation, making the bow absent.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the white artificial flower still visible and centered within the large gray ribbon bow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a completely altered object, an owl-like figure, with no visible bow or flower elements that were central in Image A. The transformation into an owl-like structure means the white artificial flower within the large gray ribbon bow is absent in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the small gray ribbon bow with a white flower still attached to the right handle by a silver chain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no indication of a bag or a handle. The image depicts an entirely different object resembling an owl, lacking handles or chains attached to a bow with a flower. Thus, the small gray ribbon bow from Image A is not present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the silver chain still visibly connected to the small bow and the right handle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B no longer features a bag or handles to attach a silver chain. The composition now reflects an owl-like item, making any previous connections irrelevant as they no longer exist. The transformation has left no hint of a bow or handle connection.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the bag’s body still cream-colored and shaped like a woven basket with horizontal ridges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Instead of a cream-colored, woven basket-shaped bag, Image B displays a decorative object with scalloped patterns and an owl appearance. This indicates the bag's original form and texture is no longer present.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the beige satin interior lining still visible inside the top opening of the bag?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the transformation to an owl-like decorative object, we no longer see an interior lining such as beige satin. The new item lacks any openings or visible interiors that a bag would have displayed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the background still a white brick wall with a flat white surface beneath the bag?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Even though the main subject has changed significantly, the background in Image B still consists of a white brick wall with a flat surface beneath the object, maintaining consistency with the setting from Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the text “JourFin LoveRibbon®” still visible in the bottom-right corner of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B retains the same branding feature as Image A, with the text 'JourFin LoveRibbon®' present in the bottom-right corner, indicating continuity in branding between the images.",
