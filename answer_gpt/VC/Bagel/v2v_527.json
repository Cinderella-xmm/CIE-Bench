        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is depicted in a LEGO-style, which is characterized by blocky and geometric shapes typical of LEGO bricks. The color of the dog is a golden yellow, which is consistent with the original golden color of the dog in Image A, despite the change in style. Therefore, it retains the golden color.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stop sign maintains its octagonal shape. This shape is a universal standard for stop signs, making it easily recognizable. Comparing this with Image A, both images preserve the octagonal shape of the stop sign.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On examining Image B, the stop sign still features the word 'STOP' in white letters, which is standard for such signs. The consistency in text color and style helps maintain its recognizability and importance as a stop sign, just as seen in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO-style dog is positioned on top of the stop sign, replicating the positioning seen in Image A, where the real dog sits atop the sign. This maintains the humorous and notable aspect of the original image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the background with a clear blue sky and clouds, similar to Image A. However, in Image B, the appearance is achieved using a consistent flat blue with simple cloud shapes rather than a gradient, which gives a strong contrast seen in graphic designs or LEGO representations.",
