      "question": "Is the white marking on the dog's snout and muzzle clearly visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is represented as a sculpture inside a glass case. The white markings on its snout and muzzle are distinctly rendered with a smooth and precise finish, typical of such crafted objects. The clear contrast between the black and white areas in the sculpture helps highlight the white markings. Thus, the white marking on the dog's snout and muzzle is clearly visible.",

      "question": "Does the dog still have a predominantly black coat with clear contrast against the white markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a sculpture of a dog with a predominantly black coat. The black areas are well-defined and polished, providing a stark and clear contrast against the white markings, which are neatly painted or carved. This clear contrast is important in realistic sculptures to depict the animal's features accurately.",

      "question": "Is the dog depicted in a relaxed yet alert posture in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture of the dog appears to be in a seated position, which often conveys a relaxed posture. However, its forward-facing position, open eyes, and attentive ear positioning suggest a degree of alertness, as if the dog is observing something closely. Sculptures often capture animals in idealized poses to convey specific traits. Thus, the depiction reflects a relaxed yet alert posture.",

      "question": "Are the dog's ears positioned naturally in relation to its head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dog's ears crafted with attention to detail, appearing symmetrically positioned and slightly forward, suggesting attentiveness. This positioning is typical of dogs when they are focused or listening to something. The sculptor seems to have captured a naturalistic posture for the ears, indicative of realism in sculptural art.",

      "question": "Do the dog's eyes retain their reflective quality in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's eyes are meticulously crafted with reflective surfaces, which is often achieved in sculptures through polishing or special materials to mimic the sheen seen in real eyes. The reflection from the glass case further enhances this effect, suggesting a lifelike presence for the sculpture. This attention to detail preserves the reflective quality of the eyes.",
