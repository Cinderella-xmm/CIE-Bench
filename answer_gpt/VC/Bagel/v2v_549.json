      "question": "Does the Funko Pop-style figure wear the same uniform and helmet as the original player?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Funko Pop-style figure has a uniform that features elements such as stripes and letters which are characteristic of baseball uniforms. By comparing with Image A, the player's uniform consists of similar features, indicating that the figure's attire is designed to emulate a typical baseball uniform. The helmet in Image B is also similar in style to the helmet worn by the player in Image A. Thus, it can be concluded that the Funko Pop-style figure is indeed wearing the same type of uniform and helmet as the original player.",

      "question": "Is the Funko Pop-style figure holding a baseball bat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Funko Pop-style figure is clearly depicted holding a baseball bat in its right hand. This is consistent with the common portrayal of baseball players holding bats. The bat is also a distinctive component of its character design, helping to establish it as a baseball player figure.",

      "question": "Does the Funko Pop-style figure maintain a similar posture to the original player while holding the bat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Funko Pop-style figure is standing still, holding the bat vertically, which appears to be a simplified and exaggerated pose typical for such figures. In Image A, the original player is holding the bat in a typical batter's stance, ready to swing. While both are holding bats, the Funko figure's pose does not capture the dynamic, ready-to-swing posture of the player in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two small baseballs near the feet of the Funko Pop-style figure. They represent typical baseballs as they are small and round, with stitches shown, which matches the common portrayal of baseballs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the product box scene includes the Funko Pop-style figure without displaying a catcher or any protective gear typical for a catcher. The focus is on the baseball figure itself, without additional elements like the protective gear used by catchers.",
