      "question": "Are the embossed dragons with detailed scales, claws, and flowing bodies clearly visible on the body of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a canister with a printed dragon design rather than embossed. The dragon illustration on the canister is a simple line drawing rather than a detailed embossed design. In contrast, Image A features a teapot with intricate detailing and embossed dragons, evident through the metalwork, showcasing detailed scales and claws. Hence, for Image B, the dragon motifs are not embossed or as detailed as in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the surface of the object textured with raised relief patterns, particularly around the dragon motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the object, which appears to be a canister, features printed graphics rather than textured patterns. The dragon motif is part of the design on the smooth surface of the canister. Image A shows a teapot with raised relief patterns and textured detailing, including the dragons. Thus, Image B does not have a textured surface with raised relief patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a distinct spout extending from the side of the object, shaped like a dragon's head with an open mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cylindrical canister with no spout extending from its side. It lacks any protrusions that would resemble a spout like the one on a teapot. Image A, by contrast, displays a teapot with a dragon-shaped spout. Therefore, Image B does not feature a spout shaped like a dragon's head.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the object retain a silver-colored, highly reflective metallic surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B is a canister with a dark green color, featuring a matte or semi-matte finish, without a metallic or highly reflective surface. On the other hand, Image A is a teapot with a silver color that is reflective, as indicated by the light reflections on its metallic surface. Hence, Image B does not have a silver-colored, reflective metallic surface.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the object positioned upright on a flat surface, such as a wooden table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the canister is situated in an upright position against a plain background. However, there is no direct indication of it being placed on a wooden table or any similarly identifiable flat surface. Given that no specific flat surface is depicted in Image B, unlike Image A that shows a teapot on a wooden table, it is unclear if Image B's canister is on a wooden table.",
