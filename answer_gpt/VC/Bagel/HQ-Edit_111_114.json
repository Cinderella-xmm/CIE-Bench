      "question": "Is the man wearing a wide-brimmed straw hat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is depicted with a hat that appears to be straw, recognizable by its light color and the visible texture suggests a straw material. The brim is wide, which provides substantial shade coverage, a characteristic common to straw hats especially worn in sunny areas. Combining these visual cues with knowledge of hat types confirms he is wearing such a hat.",

      "question": "Does the man have a full white beard and mustache?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the man without visible facial hair below his chin or around his mouth. The facial area is blurred, making it unclear, but based on visible regions around the blur, there is no indication of a beard or mustache. Therefore, no recognizable beard and mustache are present.",

      "question": "Does the scooter have a circular headlight at the front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the scooter has a distinct circular fixture resembling a headlight. Its placement is consistent with typical scooter design where headlights are centrally located. The shape and position are indicative of a scooter headlight. Combining scooter design knowledge indicates the presence of a circular headlight.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the scooter with a structure beneath the headlight that resembles a grille. Although due to the stylized texture, it may not be shining, its shape and location suggest a comparison with such an element in real scooter design, normally found below headlights.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's no visible structure matching a metal luggage rack at the scooter's front. Typical luggage racks are shown as metal constructs protruding or mounted distinctly, which is absent here in the depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a scooter with wheels visible at the front, with tire texture and the depiction lacks visible spokes or rear wheel details due to the stylization, possibly concealed by the design elements. In real scooters, spoke patterns may appear but are visually absent here.",
      "weight": 3,

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
