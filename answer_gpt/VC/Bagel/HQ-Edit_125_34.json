      "question": "Is the central carved wooden panel with floral and scrollwork detailing behind the desk present and unaltered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design behind the desk does not feature a detailed carved wooden panel but rather a simple window background. Using world knowledge, carved wooden panels typically consist of intricate floral and scrollwork. Image A shows an ornate panel directly behind the desk, whereas Image B features only a window; therefore, the ornate detailing is absent or significantly altered.",

      "question": "Are the two large multi-paned windows positioned symmetrically on either side of the desk, with intact glass panes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the background shows a symmetrical arrangement of two large windows on either side of the desk, with seeming intact panes. To compare, Image A also depicts windows in a similar arrangement, but let's focus first on just the observation from Image B, which confirms the presence of symmetrical, intact windows.",

      "question": "Are the dark gray drapes tied back at both windows, maintaining their original folds and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drapes are tied back, though they may appear slightly differently in color or style compared to typical drapes, which are dark gray with folds maintained through tiebacks. In Image A, the same drape style is used; thus, Image B's drapes fulfill the criteria of being tied back and maintaining the folds.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show a tufted leather armchair partially in view on the left side. The desk is central, and the sides of the frame do not feature any visible armchairs. In Image A, there is an armchair partially visible. By comparing both images, it is apparent that the armchair is either removed or not visible in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the patterned Persian-style rug placed under the desk, extending toward the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a wooden floor without any visible rug beneath the desk extending towards the foreground. In contrast, Image A features a Persian-style rug under the desk. Thus, in Image B, the absence of the rug signifies it is no longer present.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does show a computer monitor with a silver stand and flat screen situated centrally on the desk. The monitor is positioned similarly to Image A, indicating it remains in its original position.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the space beneath the left window does not show any radiator aligned with the baseboard. Image A depicts a radiator beneath the windows. After evaluating both images, Image B lacks the radiator, suggesting its removal.",
