    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the blue circular spots present on the serpent’s body, positioned as eyes or eye-like features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent has blue circular spots that resemble eye-like features on its body. These spots are positioned alternately with other shapes across the serpent's body. The positioning and design make them appear as decorative eye motifs, which is a common feature in artistic depictions of such creatures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the red and yellow colors form the primary scale patterns along the serpent’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent’s body predominantly features a mix of red and yellow colors which form intricate and colorful patterns resembling scales. This design choice makes the red and yellow colors prominent throughout the entire length of the serpent’s body.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the black zigzag or spotted patterns visible as tribal markings on the serpent’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there aren't any clear black zigzag or spotted patterns on the serpent body that would typically represent tribal markings. Instead, the patterns are more fluid and artistic, lacking the distinct zigzag or spotted design commonly associated with tribal marks.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the segments of the serpent’s body shaped like spheres or near-spheres, reflecting the original bead form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent’s body is depicted as a continuous and elongated form without pronounced spherical or near-spherical segments. This design choice does not closely resemble the sphere-like form of individual beads from the original image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the surface of the serpent retain a matte, slightly uneven texture resembling hand-painted craftsmanship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent illustration is smooth and flat, typical of digital or stylized art, with no visible texture indicating a matte or uneven surface. The design appears uniform and does not showcase the hand-painted-like texture seen in some artworks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the colors red, yellow, blue, black, and white all present in the serpent’s body, maintaining the original palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors red, yellow, blue, and black are prominently used in the serpent’s design. While there is a suggestion of light or highlight areas, actual white is not clearly present in the serpent's body as a major color. Thus, it mostly maintains the original palette but lacks clear white.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the patterns on the serpent’s body irregular and varied from segment to segment, matching the original bead diversity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns on the serpent’s body are well-defined but not as varied or irregular from segment to segment as seen in the original bead design. The design largely uses repeated motifs, lacking the diverse and irregular variation seen in the bead’s individual designs.",
