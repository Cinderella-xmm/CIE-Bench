    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a raised platform beneath the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building structure resembles a steampunk machine with various gears and piping, situated on a base that does not appear as a traditional raised platform typical for buildings. Instead, it seems integral to the ground level, part of the machine's design rather than a separate platform. This visual suggests there is no distinct raised platform beneath the building as one would typically identify a platform.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a still water surface directly in front of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a steampunk structure without any indication of water surfaces nearby. The base and environment lack reflective qualities or any elements typical of a still water surface like reflections or water texture. This indicates the absence of a still water surface in front of the structure.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the building have multiple horizontal tiers stacked vertically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure appears as an intricate steampunk machine rather than a conventional building. It features cylindrical and conical sections but is organized more like mechanical components rather than distinct horizontal tiers. This suggests that it does not possess multiple stacked horizontal tiers in the traditional architectural sense.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the building positioned centrally above the water pool on a raised platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a steampunk structure with no visible water pool, and it seems to be part of the ground level rather than elevated on a platform. The building is complex, with many gears and pipes, integrated with the ground, emphasizing that it does not stand above a water pool on a raised platform.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sky dark blue with scattered stars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a uniform light blue with no visible stars, typical of a steampunk environment. The background complements the mechanical nature of the structure, lacking the attributes of a night sky like stars or darkness.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there trees arranged symmetrically on both sides of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a steampunk machine that does not include any natural elements like trees within the frame. The focus is on the intricate design of the machinery, with no symmetrical tree arrangement on either side.",
