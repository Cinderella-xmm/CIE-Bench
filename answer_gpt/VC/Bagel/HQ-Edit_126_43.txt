    "Question": "Q1: Is there at least one clock face with Roman numerals visible on the front or side of the structure?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a futuristic, steampunk-style robot with a prominent central design resembling a clock face. Upon analyzing the robot, we notice a circular element with hands that resemble a clock on its chest, but without visible Roman numerals; instead, it has modern, steampunk elements. Therefore, based on Image B alone, there is no clock face with Roman numerals.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are there transparent glass panels on the lower section of the clock showing internal mechanical components such as pendulums and weights?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the robot does not have any transparent glass panels or sections resembling a traditional clock's pendulums and weights. Instead, it shows intricate mechanical components as part of its exterior design. Therefore, we conclude that it does not showcase internal components like a traditional clock through glass panels.",
