      "question": "Are the broccoli florets in both dishes still composed of distinct tree-like branching structures with dark green crowns and lighter green stems?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both dishes contain broccoli florets that are visually consistent with the distinct tree-like branching structures, characterized by noticeable darker green crowns and lighter green stems. This morphological structure is typical of broccoli, where the head resembles a mini tree with a visible trunk and branches. The visual cue of the tree-like form is clearly present in the broccoli florets in both dishes, and the colors are also distinct, demonstrating the preservation of this characteristic.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the cauliflower florets retain their compact, rounded, and textured white clusters regardless of size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no cauliflower florets present. The dishes only contain broccoli florets. Therefore, the question of whether the cauliflower florets retain their structure does not apply to Image B. The absence of cauliflower means that it cannot be assessed for any compactness, roundness, or texture.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the vegetables in the left dish still bright green (broccoli) and creamy white (cauliflower), without any browning or charring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left dish contains bright green broccoli florets. There are no creamy white cauliflower florets present in Image B's left dish. The bright green visuals indicate that the broccoli is fresh and uncooked, without any evident browning or charring. Hence, while the broccoli retains its fresh appearance, the absence of cauliflower makes it impossible for cauliflower to be assessed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the vegetables in the right dish still exhibit golden-brown caramelization and dark charred edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the right dish's broccoli does not display golden-brown caramelization or charred edges. Both dishes appear to contain raw broccoli without signs of roasting or charring, indicating that no caramelization has occurred, contrasting with what these qualities suggest. Hence, the right dish does not conform to these fried or roasted characteristics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are both dishes identical in shape—rectangular with two handles at the top and bottom—and made of white ceramic material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both dishes are distinctly rectangular and appear to possess two handles at the top and bottom. The material resembles white ceramic, which is smooth and reflective of typical kitchenware. The dishes' design is classic and symmetrical, corroborating their identicality in shape and material.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a background that appears to be a light brown wooden surface with visible horizontal patterns, consistent with natural wood grains. The coherent grain patterns across the surface further underscore the wooden texture's visual realism. This feature highlights the natural look, as typical with wooden tables or countertops.",
      "weight": 2,

      "question": "Is the dish containing raw vegetables positioned on the left, and the dish containing roasted vegetables on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both dishes contain raw broccoli, with no visible signs of roasting, caramelization, or charring. Both dishes in the image contain the same type of broccoli, appearing raw and green without any cooked elements. Therefore, they are both raw, and the description of 'roasted on the right' does not apply.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there visible seasoning specks or browning marks inside the right dish, particularly around the roasted vegetables?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right dish containing broccoli lacks visible seasoning specks or browning marks. The presence of such marks would usually indicate a degree of cooking or seasoning that alters the floret appearance, which is not seen here. Both dishes appear to contain uncooked vegetables without visible seasoning residues or signs of roasting.",

      "question": "Is the lighting evenly distributed from above, resulting in minimal shadows under the dishes and vegetables?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears to be evenly distributed across the surface with minimal shadows noticeable under the dishes or vegetables. The consistency of light distribution suggests a top-down lighting source, which reduces shadowing and creates an evenly lit scene. This type of lighting is common in setting environments that aim to highlight objects clearly, such as photography of food or products.",
