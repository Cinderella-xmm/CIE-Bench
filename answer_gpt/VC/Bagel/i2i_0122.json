      "question": "Are the glass cups transparent and maintain their cylindrical shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass cup is shown to be transparent, as evidenced by its see-through nature that allows us to discern the smooth brown liquid inside. The edges and contours of the cup suggest a rounded, cylindrical shape, typical of many glass tumblers. This observation is based on the clear outlines and reflection of the liquid within the cup.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the beverage inside the cups retain its brown color and smooth texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The liquid in the cup in Image B appears to have a consistent brown color, suggesting it could be coffee, tea, or another similar beverage. The surface of the liquid looks smooth, which is typical for such beverages when undisturbed. There are no visible disruptions or alterations to its appearance that suggest otherwise.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the steam visibly rising above the cups in a natural manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible steam rising from the cup. The lack of steam indicates that the liquid is not hot enough to produce steam or it was not captured in the image. Therefore, the steaming effect noted in a warm environment is missing in this image.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the cups sit firmly on the wooden surface, showing their shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cup is positioned on a wooden surface, but there is no discernible shadow directly associated with it. The lighting conditions and angle in the image may contribute to the absence of a noticeable shadow. However, traditionally, objects placed on a surface should cast shadows under normal lighting conditions, which is not evidently depicted here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image retain a warm tone, highlighted by the steam and beverages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a cooler tone overall, as inferred from the snow-covered background and the lighting colors depicted. The absence of steam and the cool ambiance of the surrounding environment detract from a traditionally warm scene generated by hot beverages and steam. The cooler exterior setting with snow does not inherently convey warmth.",
