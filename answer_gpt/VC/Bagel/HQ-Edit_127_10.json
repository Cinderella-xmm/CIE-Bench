      "question": "Does the edited image retain the intricate wrought-iron lattice structure of both Eiffel Towers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image is a snow globe that contains miniatures of the Eiffel Towers. The miniature towers do depict a lattice structure. While the detailing is limited by the miniature scale, the essential visual feature of the lattice pattern typical of the Eiffel Tower is retained, suggesting the intricate wrought-iron structure is portrayed accurately within the constraints of such a smaller representation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both towers supported by a triangular base composed of four distinct pillars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image is a snow globe containing miniatures of the Eiffel Towers. The base of each tower is depicted with clear, separate legs that spread out, mimicking the original Eiffel Tower's structure with a triangular-like distribution. This implies that the design involves four distinct supporters meeting at points, which is characteristic of the Eiffel Tower.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a clearly defined archway beneath each tower through which the path passes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image shows the Eiffel Tower miniatures within a snow globe. The towers are simplified, and while they appear to have an open space below the middle part, they do not detail a clearly defined archway in the manner required for a path to pass through as in real life. Instead, they are simply miniatures posed on a stand.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there exactly two Eiffel Towers present in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals two miniature Eiffel Towers inside the snow globe. No additional miniature towers or figures that could represent another Eiffel Tower are visible. Thus, exactly two are present in the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does each tower have a pointed spire at its apex?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, careful observation of the miniatures within the snow globe shows that each tower has a distinct pointed structure at the top of its apex, consistent with the iconic pointed spire of the actual Eiffel Tower.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there three distinct horizontal platform levels visible along the height of each tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature Eiffel Towers in the snow globe do appear to incorporate representations of platform levels. However, without the detailed resolution to clearly see three distinct levels, it's evident that the towers have limited detailing, and the presence of such distinct horizontal platforms is not clearly visible or defined as they appear on the actual Eiffel Tower.",
