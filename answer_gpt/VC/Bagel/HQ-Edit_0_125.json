    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the woman’s face clearly visible with the same eye shape, nose, mouth, and short wavy black hair as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's face is blurred and thus not clearly visible. Her hair does appear to be short, wavy, and black as it is in Image A. However, the defining features like the eye shape, nose, and mouth cannot be assessed due to the blurring. Therefore, the woman's facial details are not visible to verify if they are the same.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the robe maintain the red-on-right and navy-blue-on-left color division across the torso and sleeves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robe displays a black and red color scheme, with noticeable gold floral patterns. Both the color divisions and the floral patterns differ significantly compared to Image A, where the robe has red on the right and navy blue on the left. This difference in color layout clearly indicates a change.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the rose and vine floral patterns visible along the robe’s seams, front panel, and sleeves as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robe features gold floral patterns that are distinctly different from the rose and vine patterns seen in Image A. The patterns in Image B appear more stylized and consistent with a different motif altogether.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a high slit on the right leg of the robe, revealing part of the leg?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robe has a visible high slit on the right leg, exposing part of the leg, similar to the design in Image A. This detail is consistent across both images.",

      "question": "Are red paper lanterns visible hanging in rows above the market alley, glowing warmly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background does not depict a market alley or red paper lanterns. Instead, it features a plain, light-colored background with a different context entirely, lacking the warm glow from paper lanterns.",
      "weight": 2,

      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display a market scene with stalls or any produce like tomatoes, oranges, and green vegetables. Instead, the background focuses on a calendar setting, which is vastly different from the market scene depicted in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the ground paved with stone tiles and the roof supported by wooden beams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include details such as stone tiles or any roof structure, as the setting shifts away from a physical market alley to a calendar theme. Thus, elements like stone tiles or wooden beams are not present or visible.",
