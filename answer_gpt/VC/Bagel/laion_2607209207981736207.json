    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the \"Fujitsu fi-7160\" model name and logo visibly present on the top-left portion of the scanner in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the holographic scanner on the box does not display any specific brand names or logos. The top-left area lacks any markings, focusing instead on a digital interface with futuristic designs. Commonly, logos would be prominent in such a location if included. Image A has the 'Fujitsu fi-7160' logo in the referenced region, helping contrast the absence in the holographic version.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the automatic document feeder (ADF) tray open and holding multiple documents, including a boarding pass, receipt, and payment slip, in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scanner's ADF tray is not open and holding documents; it is portrayed with a focus on digital interfaces rather than physical documents. Typically, documents would be physically displayed in an obvious open tray for a scanner of this type. In Image A, the ADF is clearly filled with several types of documents. This indicates a key difference between physical and digital representations.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the five control buttons (Menu, Stop/Clear, Scan/Enter, Power, and directional navigation) arranged in the same configuration on the right side of the scanner in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic display in Image B shows buttons on the scanner, which do not match the exact arrangement seen in Image A. They seem more abstractly designed to fit digital aesthetics rather than practical arrangement for use. Image A provides a standard layout for control buttons expected on a physical scanner, which is not mirrored precisely in the holographic version.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the power button illuminated in green on the right-side control panel of the scanner in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no green illumination indicating an active power button. The holographic display focuses more on futuristic design elements without showing a power indication similar to Image A. Generally, a green light indicates activity or on status, which is evident in Image A but not in the holographic version.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the row of bristle rollers visible beneath the scanning bed of the scanner in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a representation of bristle rollers beneath the scanning bed, which resembles Image A. Scanners typically have visible rollers for feeding documents, confirming the similarity between both images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the boarding pass, receipt, and payment slip clearly visible in the ADF tray with readable text such as \"Boarding Pass\", \"Receipt\", and \"Payment Slip\" in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible ADF tray with documents containing readable text like 'Boarding Pass', 'Receipt', or 'Payment Slip'. The holographic version focuses on digital elements and lacks physical document representations, unlike Image A where distinct texts on the documents are clearly visible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the scanner in the holographic display maintain the original black and light gray color scheme of the Fujitsu fi-7160?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color scheme in Image B diverges significantly from the black and light gray of Image A. Instead, it features various bright, holographic colors meant to emphasize digital and futuristic appeal, rather than maintain the original color scheme seen in the physical version.",
