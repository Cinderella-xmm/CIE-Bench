        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a blurred face area, obscuring the details of the facial structure that could include features like eyes, nose, mouth, and beard. Therefore, it's not possible to determine whether these elements are retained, leading to the conclusion that they are likely altered or missing.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the headdress shape and position on the subject's head. However, while the structure is similar, identifying specific patterns like a central diamond motif is obscure due to the blurred facial area, and thus may not be visible or guaranteed.",
