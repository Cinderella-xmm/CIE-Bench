      "question": "Is the glass bulb shaped like a teardrop with visible internal filaments present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual depiction is of a cartoon character in the form of a light bulb, featuring a full, round-shaped bulb head which is different from a teardrop-shaped glass bulb. Additionally, the cartoon design does not showcase any internal filaments which are usually expected in a real glass bulb for lighting. This imagery is more stylized and abstract, focusing on its character-like expression rather than structural details. Based on these analyses, the shape and the absence of visible internal filaments suggest the answer is 'No'.",

      "question": "Are the curved vertical bars forming a cage-like structure around the bulb present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a cartoon depiction of a light bulb character without any curved vertical bars forming a cage-like structure. Such a structure is not needed or applicable for a cartoon light bulb character; it is not part of the stylized depiction. Therefore, based on visual observation, these bars are absent in the cartoon rendition.",

      "question": "Is the dark cylindrical housing at the top of the fixture with a visible screw detail present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the light bulb does not feature a dark cylindrical housing with visible screws. The cartoon character's representation simplifies the design to omit such structural components focusing more on the face and body of the character. Therefore, the absence of such housing indicates the answer is 'No'.",

      "question": "Is the circular cap at the bottom of the metal cage present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoon character in Image B does not have a circular cap at the bottom like a metal cage would. The bottom in the cartoon is stylized more as a continuation of the body design to represent an anthropomorphic bulb character without added elements like a cage cap. Consequently, the cartoon-style design lacks the described component.",

      "question": "Is the glass bulb positioned centrally within the metal cage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B solely depicts a cartoon light bulb character without any surrounding metal cage structure. Due to its stylized and humorous representation, there is no glass bulb within a cage that could be positioned centrally. As a result, the design lacks alignment within such frames.",
