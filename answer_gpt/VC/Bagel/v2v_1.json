      "question": "Does the image retain the metallic texture and finish of the bearings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bearings exhibit a metallic sheen and reflective surface characteristic of metal objects. This visual cue suggests a polished finish typical of real-life bearings and aligns with world knowledge of how metal objects appear. Therefore, the metallic texture is effectively conveyed.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the shape and structural details (rings, grooves) of the bearings accurately represented?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals bearings with discernible rings and internal grooves, offering a detailed representation of their structure which are crucial for the function. These aspects are consistent with the typical architectural design of bearings in real-world applications.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the bearings maintain their relative positions and orientations as shown in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the bearings are laid out in a manner that doesn't show their coordination within other structures, suggesting a standalone positioning. Conversely, Image B positions the bearings inside a box and partially assembled on top, indicating a different orientation and arrangement.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the text \"Facts You Need to Know about Bearings and Final Drive Motors\" still present on the chalkboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There's no chalkboard visible in Image B, and the text primarily visible is 'Fatlnal Draines,' which does not match the original text from Image A. As per common understanding, chalkboards are objects used to convey educational or informative content, which aligns with the presence of text in such settings, but it is notably absent here.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the background remain clean and uncluttered, focusing attention on the bearings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a box with intricate patterns and multiple bearings visible both in the box layers and outside, including the presence of text, none of which presents a stark contrast or isolated focus in the same way the chalkboard and two bearings did in Image A. This suggests a shift away from the clean and uncluttered presentation found in the original image.",
