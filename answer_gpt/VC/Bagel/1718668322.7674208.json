    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the irises of the eyes still blue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the irises of the eyes are not visible due to the blurring effect over the face, which obscures the eye color. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the current color of the irises.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the facial structure, including the nose, jawline, and cheekbones, unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurring effect present in Image B makes it impossible to suitably assess or compare the facial structure, including features such as the nose, jawline, and cheekbones.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the subject positioned with a slight leftward turn of the body while facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the body posture visible in Image B, the subject's torso appears to be turned slightly to the left while facing forward, indicated by the angle of the shoulders and the direction of the body. This posture commonly suggests a leftward turn.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both arms positioned naturally at the sides of the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the framing and angle, only one arm's position can be clearly discerned. Thus, it cannot confidently be stated that both arms are naturally positioned at the sides of the body.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the skin tone consistent with a natural light complexion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face is obscured, making it difficult to ascertain the skin tone directly. However, other visible skin areas or surroundings do not provide enough visual evidence to conclusively determine a natural light complexion for the subject.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the lips closed in a neutral expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurring effectively conceals the facial expression, including the position of the lips. Therefore, it is not possible to ascertain if the lips are closed in a neutral expression.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
