        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is drawn in a chibi style with a curled-up position. It is depicted with its paws tucked in, and none of the paws are visibly stretched out. To deduce this, the curved posture and the placement of the limbs are assessed based on typical chibi illustrations where the character's features are exaggerated yet simplified, leading to the conclusion.",

      "question": "Is the cat shown lying on a curved surface representing the car's hood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is illustrated resting on a flat, stylized surface that resembles a simple drawing of a hood. While it suggests the surface could represent the hood of a car, it does not realistically depict a curved surface as seen in real life. The edge of the area where the cat lies also appears more angular than curved. This conclusion is reached using visual cues from the design that imply but do not confirm a curved car hood.",

      "question": "Are there reflection lines present on the curved surface under the cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include reflection lines on the surface under the cat. The design style of the illustration is simplified, which omits intricate details like reflection lines typically associated with shiny surfaces. This observation is confirmed by analyzing the surface represented, which shows no additional lines that would indicate reflections.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a sticker design that is distinctly surrounded by a thick white outline. This outline encircles the entire sticker image, including the cat and the surface it lies upon. The presence of such an outline is typical in sticker designs for contrasting with backgrounds and improving visibility. This deduction is made by observing the boundary designed around the sticker.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the sticker have a transparent background behind the outlined image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background of the sticker appears uniform, consistent with the design of chibi-style stickers. While the visual suggests a solid background due to the white outline, the context implies transparency outside this outline. Sticker graphics often have a transparent background to facilitate easy placement on various surfaces, although this is suggested rather than directly observable here.",
