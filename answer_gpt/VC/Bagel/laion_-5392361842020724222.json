      "question": "Is there a golden circular halo positioned directly above Mary's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a circular golden halo above Mary's head, which is visually indicative of holiness or divinity, a common attribute in religious depictions of Mary. The halo is distinct and positioned directly over her head, reinforcing the perception of sanctity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does Joseph hold a staff with a white lily flower at its tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Joseph does not seem to be holding a staff with a white lily flower. Unlike traditional depictions where the staff symbolizes purity and righteousness, Image B shows Joseph without such an attribute.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a golden radiating halo (fan-shaped rays) behind the infant Jesus' head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the infant Jesus has a halo behind his head, but it is not specifically fan-shaped with radiating rays. The depiction seems more simplistic compared to some traditional illustrations that include detailed fan-shaped halos.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "question": "Is Mary depicted in a kneeling position with her hands clasped in front of her?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Mary is indeed depicted in a kneeling position with her hands clasped in front of her, which is a traditional posture of reverence and prayer, commonly seen in nativity scenes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the infant Jesus in a reclined position, but the arms are not visibly crossed over the chest. Instead, this depiction focuses on the infant lying in a restful pose rather than specifically showing crossed arms.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the figures arranged such that Mary is on the left, Joseph on the right, and the infant Jesus is centrally located between them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition is such that Mary is positioned on the left, Joseph on the right, and the infant Jesus is centrally located between them, which is a classical arrangement in nativity representations to suggest a family scene.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Do Mary and Joseph stand on separate rocky bases beneath their feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Mary and Joseph are depicted on a shared, similar surface rather than on distinctly separate rocky bases. Their backgrounds are more uniformly integrated into the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is there a white, fluffy surface beneath the infant Jesus?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface beneath the infant Jesus appears to be a fabric or material, often used for portrayal in these scenes, but it lacks the fluffy texture as the one in Image A, which indicates a different type of bedding or covering.",
