    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are both arms extended horizontally to the sides, forming a symmetrical T-shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's arms are raised in a manner that resembles an embrace, with each arm extended outward at an angle rather than horizontally straight. The composition is not symmetrical like a perfect T-shape. This visual cue suggests a stance that is more open and dynamic rather than rigidly symmetrical.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the head tilted upward and slightly toward the left side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues of the head suggest it is positioned straight forward without any discernible upward tilt or inclination toward a particular side. This positioning creates a sense of balance and symmetry typical in classical artwork, lending the figure a composed and serene demeanor.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the figure have a beard and hair covered by a hooded garment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For Image B, the attire resembles a traditional Asian robe with artistic patterns, and there's no indication of a beard or hood typically associated with certain garments. The design conventions reflect more ceremonial or cultural elements without any facial hair or hood.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both hands open with palms facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual depiction of the hands shows that they are open and extended outward, but the palms are facing slightly upward rather than directly forward. This hand positioning conveys invitation or welcoming, common in traditional poses observed in illustrations.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the robe cover the entire body from shoulders to the base of the statue, with vertical folds running down the front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a robe with intricate designs that cover the entire figure from shoulders to the lower edge of the artwork. However, the decorative elements disrupt the appearance of singular, vertical folds typical in simple robes, giving it a more ornate presence rather than straightforward vertical flow.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the statue shown in a frontal pose, viewed from a low angle looking upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the figure positioned from a direct, frontal perspective without evident low-angle distortion. This rendering style is consistent with traditional illustrations aiming to clarify details without relying on three-dimensional perspectives typically observed from low angles.",
