      "question": "Is the brand name \"WARING\" displayed in bold white capital letters on a black rectangular plaque with a textured border?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brand name 'WARING' is prominently shown in bold white capital letters on a black rectangle on the packaging. The border appears to be textured. Based on world knowledge, product branding often uses distinct and bold lettering to ensure visibility and recognition. For comparison, Image A shows the food processor itself, where the black plaque with the brand name is visible on the base, similarly using bold white letters. The plaque matches the description in the question, so the observation in Image B is consistent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the control buttons labeled \"OFF\" (red), \"ON\" (green), and \"PULSE\" (blue) arranged horizontally on the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the product box displays these buttons on the food processor's base, but the labeling is not entirely visible; a button layout is implied on the package. For Image A, analyzing the food processor itself shows the buttons with labels in red, green, and blue, arranged horizontally. This matches the expected configuration, suggesting the way they're presented on the package aligns with the actual product's design.",

      "question": "Does the processing bowl have a black handle attached to its left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the food processor on the box with a black handle clearly visible on the left side of the bowl. World knowledge indicates this is a typical design element for user functionality, allowing ease of use when moving or fixing the bowl. Image A shows the same handle configuration. Thus, the description in Image B aligns with the visible setup of the product.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a transparent lid covering the bowl with a vertical feed tube and a pusher mechanism visible at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a depiction of the processor with a transparent lid displaying a vertical feed tube; the presence of a pusher mechanism is implied by the typical components seen on food processors. Image A clearly shows the transparent lid with both the feed tube and the pusher apparatus visible. Understanding typical food processor design confirms the analysis.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the feed tube a tall, vertical cylinder extending upward from the center of the lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction on the box shows a feed tube that appears as a tall cylinder extending from the lid's center. This is a common design for food processors to allow safe insertion of items. Image A confirms this by displaying the actual product with the feed tube extending vertically, demonstrating the same configuration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the base of the food processor silver metallic with black feet at the bottom corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the box illustration shows the processor with a silver metallic base and what appear to be black feet at the corners, which is a typical design choice for stability. Image A verifies this through the actual food processor, showing the same silver finish and black corner feet. This consistency validates the observation similarly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the food processor maintain the same proportional relationship between the base, bowl, and feed tube as shown in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B represents the food processor with proportions that visually match those found in Image A: the base supports the bowl and feed tube in a typical layout that maintains balance for operational efficiency. Comparing both images shows that the proportional relationship is consistentâ€”this is fundamental to the functional design of kitchen appliances.",
