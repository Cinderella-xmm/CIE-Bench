      "question": "Is the nemes headdress present with its characteristic wide, striped, layered shape covering the head and shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image shows a steampunk-inspired design with mechanical elements and wings. This differs significantly from the traditional nemes headdress, which is characterized by its wide, striped, layered shape typically seen in ancient Egyptian attire. Therefore, the traditional nemes headdress is not present in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the uraeus cobra positioned centrally on the forehead, above the eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second image, there is no visible feature consistent with the uraeus cobra commonly found positioned on Egyptian headdresses. The design in Image B is steampunk and does not include the traditional snake emblem.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a false beard extending vertically from the chin, matching the original pleated form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a distinctly different design featuring steampunk aesthetics and does not include traditional elements such as the false beard typically associated with ancient Egyptian masks.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face in Image B is obscured and does not exhibit any almond-shaped eyes since the visible elements focus on the steampunk theme with gears and mechanical parts, making it impossible to confirm the presence of such features.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ears are not present as the design centers around mechanical components and wing structures associated with a steampunk theme, deviating from natural human features.",

      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image displays a mechanical steampunk device that does not mimic the traditional broad collar associated with Egyptian artifacts, which usually features horizontal band structures.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the steampunk object in a frontal view, maintaining symmetry, which aligns with the question regarding a frontal and symmetrical presentation.",
