    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the dog's large, round, black eyes clearly visible and positioned symmetrically on the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's eyes appear as large, round, black elements that are evenly positioned on either side of the face. This symmetry and clarity in placement are consistent with typical Lego or constructed figurines using contrasting colors to emphasize features such as eyes.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dog's black nose clearly present and centered on the snout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nose in Image B is depicted as a distinct black element centrally located on the snout. The use of a darker shade ensures it stands out against the lighter tones of the dog's face, signaling its presence clearly.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the dog's mouth open, revealing a pink tongue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the representation does not show an open mouth or a pink tongue. The mouth area is suggested by layering or curved elements, typical in styled representations, without showing an open state.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both ears floppy and positioned symmetrically on either side of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows both ears as symmetrical elements that are positioned on either side of the head, with characteristics of fluffiness being simulated by the layered construction.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a dark collar with a visible silver-colored metal ring around the dog’s neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A visible collar or metal ring is not represented in Image B. The neck area lacks any distinct dark or metallic elements indicating a collar.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the hat positioned on the dog’s head with two white pom-poms visible on either side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not illustrate a hat or pom-poms. The top of the head features structured elements that resemble fur rather than a hat with pom-poms.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the scarf wrapped around the dog’s neck, forming a visible loop or knot at the front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a red scarf is visibly wrapped around the neck region, with Lego pieces crafted to represent a layered or wrapped appearance, suggesting a scarf with a loop or knot effect typical for such a representation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the dog facing directly toward the camera with a slight upward tilt of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the dog—or the object representing a dog—facing directly forward, without any evident tilt in the head position. The arrangement and direct alignment of facial features support a straightforward orientation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
