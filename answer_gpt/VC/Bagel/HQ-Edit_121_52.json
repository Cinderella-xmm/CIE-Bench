    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the astronaut's face visible through a clear, circular helmet visor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the helmet of the illustrated astronaut is depicted with a clear visor through which the face is visible, following the general design of cartoon spacesuits. With simplified and exaggerated features common in illustrations, the visor does not obscure the features, unlike in more realistic depictions where detail and reflection may obscure visibility.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a red, white, and blue American flag patch located on the left shoulder of the suit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon astronaut suit design includes elements that mimic flag colors, such as stripes and stars. However, there is no specific flag patch visible on the shoulder, as the design focuses on an abstract theme rather than precise details found in a real suit.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a large, boxy life-support pack attached to the astronaut’s back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon astronaut features a backpack-like design characteristic of space suits' life-support systems, although it's simplified and stylized to match the cartoon theme, maintaining the iconic bulky structure.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible segmented joints at the elbows and knees of the spacesuit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoon representation in Image B opts for a smooth, rounded design typical in animated depictions, highlighting simple shapes rather than intricate details like segmented joints, which are features of more realistic spacesuit designs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there visible dust being kicked up from the lunar surface beneath the astronaut’s right boot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoon-style depiction in Image B shows a simplified lunar surface without dynamic elements such as dust. The focus is more on the character and less on environmental actions like kicking up dust, which require detailed representation absent from this style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is a bright, spherical Earth visible in the sky behind the astronaut?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is minimalist and lacks the detailed celestial bodies often associated with space images. There are no depictions of Earth or other planets, consistent with a stylized and simplified cartoon approach.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the helmet shaped as a smooth, circular dome with a reflective outer surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the helmet as a smooth, rounded dome, typical in cartoon illustrations. However, the depiction does not suggest a reflective or realistic surface; instead, it aligns with the simple and clear depictions common in cartoon styles.",
