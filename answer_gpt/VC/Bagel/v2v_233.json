    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the leaf in the edited image still ovate with a pointed tip and serrated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf is placed inside a snow globe, and it retains its ovate shape with a pointed tip and serrated edges. By closely examining the leaf in the globe, one can observe these characteristics, similar to typical leaf morphology.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the leaf retain the prominent central vein with branching secondary veins forming a network across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf inside the snow globe displays a prominent central vein from which secondary veins branch out, forming a network. This venation pattern is typical of many leaves and remains visible in the edited image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the leaf still golden-yellow with visible brown speckles and natural discolorations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leaf in Image B maintains its golden-yellow color with brown speckles and natural discolorations, which are visible even through the snow globe. The coloration and speckling are consistent with the leaf's appearance in Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the leaf retain its papery texture and minor surface imperfections such as blemishes or spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, even though the leaf is encapsulated within a snow globe, it still maintains a papery texture, as inferred from its appearance, along with minor surface imperfections like blemishes or spots. These details are visible and add to the authenticity of the leaf.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the leaf oriented with the stem pointing toward the upper left and the blade extending diagonally across the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orientation of the leaf inside the snow globe is altered. The stem points toward the left side but not specifically the upper left, and the blade does not extend diagonally in the same manner as in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the leaf the sole central object in the edited image, without any other competing elements in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the leaf is a central object, it is contained within a snow globe, which introduces snowflakes and other decorative elements. These elements compete for attention in the foreground, unlike the simplicity of Image A, where the leaf is the sole focus.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
