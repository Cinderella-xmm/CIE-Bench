      "question": "Does the image retain the oval-shaped black sink?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sink is clearly visible in a bowl shape with light color, not black. Based on the visual cue of the sinkâ€™s distinct color and its round shape in Image B, it can be concluded that the sink is not the same oval-shaped black sink found in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the mirror still rectangular with an orange backlight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror remains rectangular in shape with no visible backlighting. The lighting setup around the mirror in Image B shows traditional wall sconces, rather than an orange backlight as seen in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question": "Does the cabinet underneath the mirror remain a floating style with the same position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there does not appear to be a floating cabinet beneath the mirror. Instead, the design uses a built-in sink platform integrated into the tiled structure, suggesting a different style and positioning compared to the floating cabinet seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Are there metallic faucets present in the sink setup?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the faucets are visible above the sink, crafted in a dark metal, which is consistent with an antique or traditional design. This matches the presence of metallic faucets as typically used in sink setups.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no clear view of a window positioned next to the sink. Instead, the space is filled with architectural details and decorative elements typical of classic or possibly Mediterranean style, unlike the modern design with large windows found in Image A.",
