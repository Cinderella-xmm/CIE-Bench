      "question": "Is the subject's skin tone still dark brown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject appears as a stylized representation of an angel, with a focus on a heavenly or celestial theme. The figure is depicted with a glowing halo and wings, which are characteristic of angelic imagery, often portrayed with a lighter and radiant complexion that contrasts with the original Image A. Based on this visual cue and the typical portrayal of angels in art, the skin tone is depicted as much lighter, leaning towards a celestial and ethereal appearance rather than the dark brown skin tone seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the subjectâ€™s head tilted upward with her gaze directed toward the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the face is blurred, the general posture of the head, including the tilt, appears consistent with a forward-facing, open stance typical of angelic representations. Angels are often shown in a reverent or welcoming posture rather than gazing upward. The wings and the relaxed, open arms suggest a more static pose rather than one of upward attention.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are both arms extended outward with hands open and palms facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is depicted with both arms slightly spread from the body, which is a common angelic pose symbolizing embrace or divine beneficence. However, the hands, though blurred, appear closed or holding the garment, diverging from the gesture of open palms facing forward.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the subject have braided hair, even if stylized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the figure's head is topped with a stylized halo with more classical angelic features such as wavy and flowing locks rather than distinct braids, contrasting with the braided hairstyle in Image A. This aligns with traditional celestial imagery.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lower portion of the garment flaring outward, suggesting motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the garment, a long robe typically associated with angels, is shown with elaborate, flowing folds that give the illusion of motion, as if caught in a gentle breeze, mimicking the original motion effect in Image A where the dress also flares outward.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the subject smiling with visible teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurred face of the subject in Image B prevents a clear view of the facial expression, therefore, it is impossible to confirm whether the subject is smiling with visible teeth. Given the artistic style and typical serene, neutral expressions used in celestial portrayals, a smile with visible teeth is unlikely.",
