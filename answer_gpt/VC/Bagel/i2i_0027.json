      "question": "Is the dog's pose still focused on the tennis ball, with the ball near its nose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is represented as a cartoon or figurine with exaggerated features and not in a realistic pose or posture. The tennis ball is held by the dog figurine, but the figure is not in a realistic pose of focusing or interacting with the ball. Instead, it is holding the ball in a stance typical of cartoon representations. Thus, the pose is not focused on the ball in the sense of being near the dog's nose.",

      "question": "Does the tennis ball retain its green color with a pink stripe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon or figurine of a dog holds a tennis ball that is green with a pink stripe. This appearance is consistent with the traditional tennis ball colors seen in Image A, where the tennis ball is green with a pink stripe. Therefore, the color scheme is retained.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the dog still depicted as observing or interacting with the tennis ball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog figurine is holding a tennis ball, but its exaggerated cartoon style and static pose do not imply active observation or interaction as seen in Image A. The figurine's stance does not convey direct engagement or a focused action towards the tennis ball.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the dog's posture still reflect a prone, ball-focused position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dog in Image B is represented as a figurine that is upright and holding a ball, which contrasts with the realistic depiction in Image A where the dog is more deliberately positioned as focusing on the ball with a prone posture. Hence, the posture does not reflect the same focused orientation towards the ball.",

      "question": "Is the texture of the tennis ball (felt-like surface) still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis ball is part of a cartoonish figurine, lacking realistic texture details, especially those of a felt-like surface typical of real tennis balls. The smooth and stylized representation of the ball in the cartoon or figurine format does not indicate a felt-like texture.",
