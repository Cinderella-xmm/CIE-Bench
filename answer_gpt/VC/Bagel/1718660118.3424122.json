    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the subject's face clearly showing the same facial structure as in the original image, including the long nose, high cheekbones, and symmetrical eye placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face is intentionally blurred, which obscures detailed analysis of facial structure, including features such as a long nose, high cheekbones, and symmetrical eye placement. Therefore, a direct comparison to the original image's facial details is not possible.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the subject retain the white powdered wig with voluminous curls framing the sides of the head, matching the original hairstyle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's wig is consistent with the attire expected in historical portraits, and the large white wig with voluminous curls frames the sides of the head just as in Image A. This conclusion is drawn from the visual resemblance to traditional period-specific wigs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are both hands positioned on the armrests of the chair, with fingers relaxed and palms facing downward, mirroring the original posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows both hands on the armrests of the chair, with fingers positioned similarly in a relaxed posture as seen in traditional portraitures. The palms appear to face downward, matching the posture in Image A.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orientation of the body and head is clearly directed forward, maintaining a frontal view as evident in traditional portraits. This indicates a consistent alignment with the orientation in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the proportionate body structure, with no visible distortions in head-to-body ratio or limb lengths. The body calibration appears uniform, similar to the traditional portrait style in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B suggests illumination from the upper left, creating shadows on the right side of the subject's attire. This lighting direction aligns with common portrait lighting techniques, similar to Image A.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the shoulders, arms, and facial features aligned symmetrically, with no noticeable imbalance in positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the subject in a symmetrical posture, with arms and shoulders evenly placed. The lack of facial detail prevents full facial symmetry analysis, but body symmetry is evident and consistent with Image A.",
