      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the girl retain her original throwing posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl's hands are extended outward, which suggests she is in a posture that implies motion, possibly throwing. Comparing this with Image A, where the girl indeed has her arms raised in a throwing position, leads to the conclusion that the original posture is retained.",

    {

      "question": "Are the red dress and polka-dot pattern retained intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl is wearing a red skirt with a white polka-dot pattern, similar to what appears in Image A. The visual pattern and color of the garment match well, showing that it is retained intact.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the girl still positioned in the foreground relative to the ground or new sci-fi background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl is depicted in the foreground of a sci-fi background which contrasts strongly with the real-world setting in Image A. However, she remains in the foreground position relative to the new background just as she was in an open area in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the girl's feet still placed on the stone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the girl standing in a sci-fi environment, with no stone visible beneath her feet, contrasting with Image A where she is on a stone. Thus, the placement has changed from standing on a stone to another surface in the edited image.",
      "weight": 1,

      "question": "Are the girl's hands still extended outward as if throwing something?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl's hands are still stretched outward, similar to a throwing posture observed in Image A. This indicates that her hand positioning, suggesting a throw, is maintained in the edited image.",
