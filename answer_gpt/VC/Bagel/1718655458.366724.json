      "question": "Is the flowing brown and gray marbled pattern visible on the surfaces of the LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a set of LEGO bricks that have a distinct marbled pattern. The pattern consists of flowing brown and gray colors, which are clearly visible across the surfaces of each brick. This evaluation is based on the visual observation of the marbling effect on the bricks in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the LEGO bricks rendered with a white base color accented by warm brown and gray marbling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks have a base color that is not purely white but more of a neutral light background, upon which the warm brown and gray marbling is applied. The marbling is the accent color that provides visual interest to the LEGO bricks. Thus, the base color is not prominently white but complements the marbling effect.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the marbled veins follow an organic, irregular flow rather than a geometric or repetitive pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The marbling pattern on the LEGO bricks in Image B appears to have an organic, flowing nature that does not conform to a geometric or repetitive layout. This is typically characteristic of natural marble, which features irregular and variable vein patterns, as opposed to structured, repetitive designs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both warm brown and gray veins present together in the marbled pattern of the LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observation of Image B, it's clear that both warm brown and gray color veins coexist within the marbled pattern on the LEGO bricks. The visual evidence on the bricks shows a mix of these two color tones, creating a variegated effect.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the LEGO bricks visually appear to be made of a marble-like material based on their surface pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The marbled pattern on the LEGO bricks, featuring flowing veins of brown and gray, mimics the appearance of actual marble. This decorative pattern gives the impression that the bricks could be made of marble-like material, even though LEGO bricks are made of plastic. The visual pattern successfully conveys the look of marble.",
