      "question": "Is the character wearing a rust-orange jacket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the character is depicted in a drawing style where a chibi version of the character wears a jacket. The color of the jacket appears to be rust-orange, which is similar to the jacket color in a stylized representation. This indicates the color has been retained from some real-life images of such jackets that have a distinct rust-orange hue.",

      "question": "Is the snowboard positioned under the character’s feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character is shown in different poses on a snowboard, which consistently appears under their feet. This reflects a common representation of snowboarding, where the snowboard is depicted correctly under the feet for functionality.",

      "question": "Does the character wear a black helmet with red-tinted goggles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is illustrated wearing a black helmet. However, the goggles featured on the helmet are not visibly red-tinted due to the stylized, simple art style typically seen in chibi illustrations, which focus on overall impressions rather than specific details.",

      "question": "Does the character have long brown hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B's cartoon-style, the character does not prominently feature long hair outside the helmet, which simplifies details like hair for visual style purposes. Dark color used cannot be conclusively identified as brown within the chibi design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited stylized Image B, the character wears dark pants, matching the usual representation in such images for stylistic simplification often mimicking black pants due to their contrast in art.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each chibi illustration shows the complete outline of the character without anything cut off. Each depiction is well-contained within its frame, which is typical in such artworks ensuring full visibility.",
