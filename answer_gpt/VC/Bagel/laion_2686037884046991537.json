    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does each whoopie pie character retain a dark brown chocolate-colored outer layer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the whoopie pie characters feature a dark brown outer layer, consistent with the typical appearance of chocolate-colored whoopie pies. This conclusion is drawn from the visual information indicating the brown shade, which is characteristic of chocolate-flavored pastries.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a visible white cream filling between the two chocolate halves of each whoopie pie character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the whoopie pies exhibit a visible layer of white filling between their chocolate halves. This observation is based on the contrast seen between the dark brown exterior layers and the bright white middle section, which resembles the cream filling of a whoopie pie.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does each whoopie pie character maintain a two-layered structure with an inner filling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image Bâ€™s whoopie pie characters display two distinct layers with an inner filling. The visual setup is consistent with the traditional structure of a whoopie pie, which includes two outer cake-like layers sandwiching a creamy filling.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a white plate present beneath the whoopie pie characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a white plate is depicted under the whoopie pie characters, serving as a base for them. Observing the white color and typical round shape of the plate, which is a standard dish presentation method, helps conclude this presence.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are at least two whoopie pie characters positioned on the edge of the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at least two whoopie pie characters are drawn near the edge of the plate, based on the proximity of their position to the illustrated boundary of the plate, which is noticeable through visual observation of spacing and alignment.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all whoopie pie characters circular in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The whoopie pie characters within Image B are depicted with a circular form, which aligns with the common round shape of actual whoopie pies. This conclusion derives from studying the curves and symmetry present in the drawings of these characters.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a clear contrast between the dark brown outer layers and the white inner filling of each whoopie pie character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a clear visual distinction marks the transition from dark brown outer layers to white inner filling within the whoopie pie characters. This contrast is easily discerned from the use of starkly different colors between the outer and inner sections.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Do the chocolate tops of the whoopie pie characters show signs of surface cracking or texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chocolate tops of the whoopie pie characters mimic the appearance of surface texture, consistent with signs of cracking and roughness typically observed in baked chocolate goods. The artistic portrayal includes linework suggestive of this texture detail.",
