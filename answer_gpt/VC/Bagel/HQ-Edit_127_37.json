      "question": "Is the feathered plume still present on top of the knight's helmet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knight is depicted as a chibi figure within a glass dome, featuring a simplified design. The helmet on the chibi knight does not have a feathered plume, which is often a decorative element in realistic versions of armor but is absent here. This is consistent with the style of chibi figures, which typically aim for minimalistic and cute representations without detailed accessories.",

      "question": "Is the rampant lion emblem clearly visible on the shield?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knight's shield has a simplified design, featuring a basic cross pattern instead of a detailed emblem like the rampant lion seen on more intricate medieval shields. Chibi representations often use simpler and less detailed designs due to their stylized nature.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the knight holding a long spear or lance in their right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi knight is depicted holding a sword, which is a common element for knight figures. The sword is significantly shorter than a lance or spear would be. Chibi styles often favor sword designs over more cumbersome lances or spears for aesthetic and practical reasons in figure display.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the knight's pauldrons and greaves visibly present in the armor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi knight's armor includes basic representations of armor elements but may not have precise details like individually distinct pauldrons and greaves as seen in highly detailed armor sets. The simpler design focuses more on conveying the idea of armor rather than detailed components.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the castle's main turret with a conical roof and flagpole still visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals a castle design simplified to accommodate the chibi style, featuring turrets with conical roofs without any visible flagpole. The decreased detail is typical in many chibi or miniature dioramas, which capture iconic shapes but omit finer details like flagpoles.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are strands of ivy hanging down from the top of the archway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no archway or hanging ivy present. The glass dome encompassing the chibi scene is devoid of such decorative elements, fitting the minimalistic and compact approach of chibi dioramas, which focus on the central figures and immediate surroundings without extensive environmental details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the knight positioned facing toward the right side of the image, with the shield on the left arm?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the chibi knight facing toward the front of the scene with the shield on the left arm. However, the orientation in a chibi representation is not as evident or clear-cut as in more detailed realistic depictions, where the knight's face direction and arm positioning might be clearer.",
