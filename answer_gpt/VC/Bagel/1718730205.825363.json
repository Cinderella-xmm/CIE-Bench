      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the cosmic vortex depicted as a multi-layered spiral structure with concentric rings winding inward toward a central point?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cosmic vortex is represented in a stained glass style, which inherently limits the depiction of detailed structures like multi-layered spirals. It presents a spiral form but lacks the realistic concentric rings and multi-layered depth that might be seen in Image A. The stained glass artwork simplifies the structure into colored segments and shapes rather than detailed cosmic elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there multiple trees with rounded, full canopies positioned in the foreground and midground of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows stylized trees in the stained glass design, positioned on both sides of the image. They have rounded, full canopies in keeping with a stained glass aesthetic, which uses strong outlines and color fills to simulate natural forms. Image A features more realistic trees with similar rounded shapes, emphasizing lush canopies.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cosmic vortex positioned directly above the forest, occupying the upper half of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cosmic vortex is positioned in the upper half, integrated into the stained glass design. The vortex becomes part of the sky region above the forest scene, similarly as seen in Image A which depicts the vortex high above the landscape occupying much of the sky.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a calm, reflective body of water in the foreground, mirroring the sky and surrounding landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays abstract fragments suggesting water at the bottom part of the stained glass composition, but lacks reflective qualities inherent to realistic water bodies. Image A shows a distinct reflective surface of water in front of the landscape, reflecting details of the sky and trees.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there mountain ranges visible in the background, situated behind the trees and beneath the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stained glass design greatly simplifies the landscape, and mountains are not distinctly visible behind the trees. Image A, however, clearly shows mountain ranges in the background, giving depth to the scene.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the trees have foliage with a noticeable pink or rose-colored tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stained glass depiction uses a dominant red tone for tree foliage, which translates to a noticeable pinkish or rose shade when compared to Image A where the foliage is depicted in more realistic pink tones.",
