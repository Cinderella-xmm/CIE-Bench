    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the clock face still white after the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face retains its original white color, which is evident from the color consistency seen across the clock's face area. This observation corroborates with the inferences drawn from general world knowledge regarding the common use of neutral colors for readability and aesthetics in clock designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both the hour and minute hands still black after the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hour and minute hands in Image B are visually identifiable as black, matching common stylistic choices seen in clocks for contrast and visibility. This visual evidence suggests they have not changed color during the editing process.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there still a red second hand on the clock after the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a distinct red second hand, which is typically thinner than the hour and minute hands for differentiation. The presence of this red hand aligns with its previous positioning and color scheme observed in common clock designs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the orange pivot point still present after the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the small orange pivot point is visible at the center of the clock where the hands are anchored. This is commonly used for aesthetics and practical design in clock mechanisms to highlight the junction where multiple hands are connected.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the clock face remain free of numbers or markings after the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock face in Image B appears to lack numbers or any form of markings, following minimalist design trends that focus on streamlined aesthetics. Such design choices are favored in settings where visual simplicity is preferred.",
