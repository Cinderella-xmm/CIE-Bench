      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly woman is depicted with her hands resting together in her lap, indicating a position where her hands are folded. This is a common posture and is visible from the image observation.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a woven basket located on the bench to the right of the seated woman?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a woven basket placed on the bench to the right of the seated woman. This placement is slightly outside of her immediate seating area, suggesting an accessory or item brought along with her.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the woman sitting on a wooden bench positioned on a paved path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bench is depicted as resting on a path-like surface. The style of the illustration may not provide clear details of a paved path, but the conceptual alignment of using a bench in a public setting often implies a pathway for accessibility.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the woman with dark footwear which could reasonably be described as slip-on shoes, and the presence of contrasting brightness around her ankles suggests white socks. The style of the footwear and socks is in line with traditional Japanese wear.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the illustration style doesn't show specific details like petals on the ground, it is using a thematic style with simplified color expressions, suggesting a different artistic interpretation of conveying nature around the bench, unlike Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a calm water canal running behind the bench, bordered by stone walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks detailed water features like a canal. Instead, it uses illustration techniques typical of traditional Japanese art which may suggest a setting but not a detailed canal with stone walls specifically.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a curved wooden bridge spanning the canal in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a bridge structure is visible, depicted in a traditional artistic style typical for representing bridges, but the image doesn't provide an obvious canal in the detailed sense but uses perspective to show a background scene.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are cherry blossom branches extending over the top of the image, partially framing the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes stylized foliage that can be interpreted as tree branches extending over the scene, but they use a different artistic style that may simplify them compared to the realistic details seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Is the womanâ€™s head facing directly forward, looking straight ahead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's head orientation suggests a forward-facing direction, consistent with a pose for such an illustration that usually depicts subjects looking forward, maintaining simplicity in posture.",
