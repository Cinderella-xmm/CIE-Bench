      "question": "Are the two tall towers positioned symmetrically on either side of the central section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure comprises two towers that are symmetrically positioned on either side of the central section, which is a typical design for castles or toy blocks resembling castles. Symmetry in architecture often helps in achieving aesthetic balance and stability. In this wooden block castle, the symmetry is clearly visible as both towers have equal height and similar design elements like crenellations, aligning them evenly on the base.",

      "question": "Is there a centrally located arched doorway with a wooden door beneath a rounded arch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts an arched doorway at the center of the structure with a rounded arch. The toy block castle doesn't have a wooden door; instead, the doorway is an opening created by the arrangement of wooden blocks which simulate the entrance of a castle. Toy structures often simulate architectural features rather than creating functional ones.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does a set of stone steps ascend from the water level directly to the arched entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows wooden steps leading upwards but clearly does not involve any water element. The steps ascend to the entrance as part of the toy design to mimic a castle's structural entrance. Toys made from wooden blocks do not involve realistic settings like water. Material and context strongly suggest the lack of water, focusing instead on a tabletop design typical of toy castles.",

      "question": "Are there multiple rectangular windows with dark frames aligned vertically on each tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design of the toy does not show windows with dark frames â€” it's a wooden block construction with cut-outs that resemble castle windows. The cut-outs mimic various architectural features but do not specifically incorporate framed windows as one would observe in an actual castle building.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the tops of both towers feature flat surfaces with crenellated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tops of the towers in Image B do feature flat surfaces with crenellated edges. Wooden blocks have been used to create these crenellations, which mimic the battlements seen on castle tops for defensive purposes. The regular pattern of these edge designs characterizes the castle-like appearance of the toy structure.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a low stone wall extending horizontally from the right side of the castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a notably low section on the right side created by the wooden blocks meant to resemble a wall extending horizontally. While it mimics the construction style typical of a castle, it's a vertical section of wooden blocks rather than a realistic low stone wall.",
