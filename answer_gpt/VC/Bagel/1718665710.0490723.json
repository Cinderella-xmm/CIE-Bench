      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the character is depicted with a chibi keychain version that simplifies details for stylistic purposes.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keychain image maintains the presence of shoulder pauldrons, though they are less detailed due to the simplified, cartoonish design. However, the shape and distinct shoulder armor is recognizable, indicating the presence of shoulder pauldrons similar to the original.",

    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the chibi keychain version, the deep red cloak draped over the shoulders is not visually present. The simplified design focuses on the armor and omits certain elements like the cloak to maintain clarity in the small illustration.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keychain stylization features prominent eyes typical of chibi art. However, eye color is often not prominently illustrated in this style, and the eyes appear black in the edited image, differing from the blue color expected.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image simplifies the details around the neck area, omitting the intricate high collar design with a decorative edge. While a collar is present, it does not retain the elaborate features seen in the original image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the character’s face retain the original jawline, nose shape, and cheekbone structure despite stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi style inherently alters facial structures due to its simplified and exaggerated features, focusing on cuteness rather than realistic anatomy. The jawline, nose shape, and cheekbone structure are replaced with standard chibi characteristics, losing the original detail.",
