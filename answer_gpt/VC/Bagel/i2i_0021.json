      "question": "Are the three sheep positioned near each other, with one adult sheep interacting closely with the two younger ones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which is a stylized representation, there are four chibi characters that resemble dogs rather than sheep, wearing winter hats and standing near a fence. Each character has its own distinct placement, and there is no indication of any being an 'adult' or 'younger'. There is no clear interaction as implied in the question since it involves a transformation from goats/sheep to cartoon-like dogs. Thus, the question of sheep positioned near each other with interaction does not apply to this image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the chibi sheep maintain their original postures, with the adult sheep standing upright and the younger ones leaning towards it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are cartoon dogs rather than sheep, and all stand facing forward with slight variations in orientation. None appears to be 'leaning in' as might be inferred from a real sheep interaction. The posture is simplified and unified across the four characters, differing from any original sheep posture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the chibi sheep retain identifiable sheep-like body proportions, such as a rounded body and small legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features cartoon dogs with characteristics typical to such simplified illustrations: rounded and compact bodies with short legs. Despite being chibi, their depiction as dogs, dressed in winter attire, makes them differ significantly from sheep in terms of anatomical proportions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible interaction displayed between the adult chibi sheep and the two younger ones, suggesting care or attention?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all characters are chibi dogs, depicted in a static and evenly spaced arrangement without any overt interaction among them. The setting doesn't imply any dynamic interaction, such as care or attention, between an assumed adult and younger ones.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the chibi sheep retain a representation of their woolly texture, even in a stylized or simplified manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates chibi dogs with smooth outlines filled with solid colors, rather than a textured or woolly appearance. The simplified art style of chibi generally favors such smooth representations, and given these are dogs with slight winter adornments, there is no indication of any sheep-like woolly texture.",
