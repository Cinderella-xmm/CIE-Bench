      "question": "Is the mustache present and clearly defined above the upper lip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face is blurred, making it impossible to discern any facial features such as a mustache. Without visible cues, we cannot conclude the presence of a mustache with certainty.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both eyes closed in the facial expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face in Image B is obscured, preventing observation of the eye status. Therefore, it is impossible to determine if the eyes are open or closed.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the figure’s right arm resting on the back of the chair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure appears to be seated in a chair. The segmented, abstract geometric shapes suggest that the right arm is positioned outward, possibly indicating it is resting on an armrest or an extended position. However, given the stylized nature, it's not clearly resting on a chair's back.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is composed of angular, abstract shapes positioned in such a way as to suggest the character is seated. The arrangement of shapes mirrors a sitting posture with bent legs and a torso leaning back.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible number in the bottom right corner. The image features abstract, colorful elements without detailed inscriptions or text visible.",
