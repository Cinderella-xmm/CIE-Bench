      "question": "Does the cat retain its upright ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat has upright ears which are a common trait in many cat breeds, contributing to their overall alert appearance. The ears in Image B are prominently placed at the top of the head and are depicted in an upright position.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the cat's large expressive eyes preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a cartoonish cat with exaggerated large eyes that are highly expressive. This style is consistent with a chibi or animated depiction. Large, expressive eyes are often used in animation to convey emotion and cuteness.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cat's sleek fur texture retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the fur is smooth but stylized in a more cartoon manner, lacking the detailed sleek texture seen in realistic or photographic images. Hence, while Image B shows fur, it doesn't capture the sleek, realistic texture as seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the cat maintain its upward gaze and posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cat looking directly at the viewer with a neutral posture, as opposed to the upward gaze noted in Image A. The cat in Image B is not in an upward-looking posture, indicating a different orientation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the cat's whiskers still visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animation style simplifies features, and the whiskers are not prominently visible as they are often in realistic portrayals. Whiskers are typically a defining feature in many cartoon representations, but they appear to be absent or very subtle in Image B.",
