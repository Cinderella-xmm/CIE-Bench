    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the dress retain the exact geometric pattern of orange-brown diamonds with spiral centers on a turquoise blue background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress features a mosaic-like pattern with multiple colors, primarily blue and orange, but the pattern is transformed into a more abstract and fragmented design compared to distinct orange-brown diamonds with spiral centers on a turquoise blue background seen in traditional garments. This artistic mosaic style changes the specifics of the pattern, making it different from the simpler pattern in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the beads on the hair arranged in the same repeating sequence of red, white, yellow, and black as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beads still exhibit a multi-colored pattern, but the sequence appears to include additional colors and patterns not strictly adhering to the original repeating sequence of red, white, yellow, and black in Image A. The art style introduces more complexity to the bead arrangement.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the braids maintain their upward-coiled crown-like structure originating from the scalp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the braids are depicted with a more stylized and abstract appearance, reminiscent of a mosaic style, which affects the details of the braid structure. While the general idea of upward-directional braids is maintained, the transformation implies a less defined coiled crown-like structure compared to Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the necklace composed of multiple horizontal layers of beads arranged in concentric rings around the neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the necklace retains the visual concept of being composed of multiple horizontal layers, but the concentric pattern is more stylized, as expected in a mosaic rendering. The rings appear denser and visually complex compared to the simpler bead arrangement in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there multiple stacked bangles present on both wrists, maintaining the original color sequence and positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although bangles are present on the wrists, the artistic alteration and mosaic style imply a potential change in color sequence or pattern details compared to the original simpler sequence in Image A. The modification in art style suggests differences compared to the original positioning and sequence.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the large circular hoop earrings present in the left earlobe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of earrings is abstract and stylized, deviating from real-world earring designs. The artistic method makes the presence of distinctive, circular hoop earrings unclear, whereas in Image A, such earrings are apparent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the girl maintain a smiling expression with direct eye contact and a forward-facing posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The girl's face in Image B is blurred out. Therefore, any specific expression, eye contact, or posture focused on is not discernible. The analysis must be based strictly on available visual elements, which do not reveal expression details.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Does the dress have a sleeveless top and a flared skirt section with vertical pleats?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress retains the fundamental structure of a sleeveless top and lower section that suggests flaring. However, due to the mosaic texture, the indication of vertical pleats is not precise, although the flared aspect is potentially represented with the artistic design.",
