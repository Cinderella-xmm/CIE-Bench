      "question": "Is the mechanical eyepatch with visible screws and metallic surface present on the central characterâ€™s right eye?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible central character with a mechanical eyepatch evident. Based on common knowledge associated with such imagery, typically these eyepatches are part of a character's distinct look and would stand out if present. The characters in Image B are depicted with specific attire related to a detective theme, without eyepatch elements. Hence, evaluating only Image B, no mechanical eyepatch can be concluded.",

      "question": "Is the central character holding an open book in both hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are shown with silhouettes that highlight detective-like features, such as one holding a magnifying glass, without any open book being held by any character. Typically, a book would be clearly discernible with pages visible, distinct from the depicted objects. Therefore, based on common visual cues, the answer is no.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there visible Chinese-style calligraphy on the cover of the book held by the central character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict any character holding a book, let alone one with discernible calligraphy markings on it. The imagery is focused on a detective theme, illustrated by the attire and background, leaving no scope for a book description. Hence, Chinese-style calligraphy on a book cover is not applicable.",

      "question": "Does the central character have short, straight black hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are portrayed wearing hats, which obscure any visible hairstyles. The depiction is in line with a noir or detective theme, where short straight black hair, if present, would be evident. Due to these hats, assessing such hair details is not possible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there four distinct supporting characters visible in the background, including one with white hair, one with purple hair, one with blue hair, and one with dark hair and red eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, only silhouettes of characters with detective-like attire are visible, devoid of distinctive hair colors or facial features that highlight supporting backgrounds. This stylistic choice does not establish distinctive hair color visibility, hence the answer must be negative.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the central character have a calm, neutral facial expression with a slightly downward gaze?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, characters have blurred faces, lacking clear depiction of facial expressions or gazes. The artwork suggests a focus on the attire element over facial detail. Without clarity on facial features, analysis on expressions cannot be determined.",
