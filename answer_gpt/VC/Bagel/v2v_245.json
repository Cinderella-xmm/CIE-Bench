      "question": "Are the two jet engines mounted under the wings of the airplane present and correctly positioned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the airplane has two propeller engines mounted under the wings, which is distinct from typical jet engines that are cylindrical and lack visible propellers. The positioning is correct under the wings, but the engines do not match the jet engine style as seen in Image A. Typically, jet engines are smooth and rounded whereas Image B shows stylized propeller engines, reflecting a toy-like design. Thus, while the engines are present, they are not standard jet engines.",

      "question": "Is the continuous row of oval-shaped passenger windows visible along the side of the fuselage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the airplane featuring a row of oval-shaped passenger windows along the fuselage, which is a common design feature in commercial aircraft. These details are clearly visible and consistent with real airplane designs and similar to what is seen in Image A. This familiarity suggests that passenger windows are indeed visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the rounded nose cone with the three-part cockpit window configuration present at the front of the airplane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the airplane's nose cone has a rounded shape, mimicking common airplane designs, although the cockpit windows are individual and separated unlike the continuous three-part design seen in Image A. The configuration in Image B has two cockpit windows and one missing window for the classic three-part alignment seen in commercial airliners, indicating a difference in design due to the toy-like modification in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tall vertical stabilizer (tail fin) present at the rear of the airplane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vertical stabilizer is clearly present in Image B, a necessary component for aerial stability and steering. Similar to Image A, it is positioned in the rear of the airplane and tall enough to maintain balance, matching typical airplane designs, though stylized here, consistent within toy designs.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the landing gear assemblies with multiple wheels visible beneath the fuselage and wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, no landing gear assemblies or wheels are visible beneath the airplane. This contrasts with Image A where the landing gear is visible, contributing to the belief for Image Bâ€™s design choice as a stylized collectible without functional landing gear.",

      "question": "Is the main wing structure extending from the fuselage with engines mounted underneath?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B indeed shows a main wing structure extending from the fuselage, complete with engines mounted underneath. The configuration is retained similar to Image A, although Image B uses stylized toy-like propeller engines which differ from actual jet engines, but confirm the general wing design with mounted engines.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the three cockpit windows arranged in a horizontal line at the front of the airplane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays two cockpit windows at the front end of the airplane, distinctly arranged horizontally, but lacking the third window to match the typical three-part arrangement seen in airplanes like Image A. This indicates a difference due to stylization for the toy in Image B.",
