    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the metallic base of the lantern with visible engraved and perforated patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the metallic base with engraved and perforated patterns is not visible. Instead, the focus is on the glass dome covering the miniature street scene. The absence of metallic elements indicates a removal or significant alteration, showing no such patterns present.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the stained-glass body of the lantern with clearly visible colored segments in red, green, blue, and orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not include any stained-glass body with colored segments. Instead, it features a miniature market scene inside a glass dome, lacking any stained-glass elements. Therefore, the distinct colored glass segments are not present.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the textured honeycomb-like internal surface of the glass body that produces a warm, diffused glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a clear glass dome over a miniature scene, and there is no indication of a honeycomb-like texture or diffused glow similar to a lantern. The glow effect seen in the original is absent, replaced by clarity in the glass dome, showing an entirely different texture without light diffusion.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the domed finial with a tiered shape and a small loop at the very top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the finial is replaced by a glass top on the dome without a tiered shape or loop. The image focuses on a different design element, primarily the miniature scene within the glass dome, indicating the finial has been removed in favor of a new feature.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image show the lantern emitting a warm, internal glow from within the glass body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image focuses on a miniature market scene without any internal glow as seen in a lantern setup. The glass dome itself does not emit any light. The visual theme shifted entirely from lighting elements to miniature modeling.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the edited image preserve the overall silhouette of the lantern as a bulbous glass body on a flared metal base topped with a conical finial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not maintain the silhouette of the lantern. Instead, it presents a glass dome covering a scene, lacking the bulbous body, flared base, and conical finial structure. This indicates a complete departure from the original lantern silhouette.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain geometric Islamic design motifs (such as stars, diamonds, or interlocking patterns) in the surrounding environment, even if scaled down or adapted into streets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the vibrant colored tiles make up the ground of a miniature street scene, indirectly reflecting geometric motifs similar to those in Islamic designs. These patterns are retained through the miniature setting, indicating continuity of the motif concept.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
