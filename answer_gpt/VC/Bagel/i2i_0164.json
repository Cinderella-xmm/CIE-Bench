      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "explanation": "The warm lighting and the angle of the shadows in Image B suggest a time of late afternoon or early evening. This conclusion is drawn from the long shadows and the soft glow typical of those times of day, consistent with the lighting conditions known to photographers and observers of natural light patterns.",
