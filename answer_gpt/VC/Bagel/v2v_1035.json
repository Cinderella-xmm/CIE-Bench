      "question": "Does the image retain the brown and white pattern characteristic of a giraffe on the nesting dolls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls feature a pattern of brown spots on a lighter background. This pattern is similar to the characteristic brown and white coat pattern of a giraffe, where brown patches are set against a lighter backdrop.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the ossicones visible on the heads of the nesting dolls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Ossicones are the horn-like structures found on the heads of giraffes. In Image B, the nesting dolls have rounded shapes and facial features, but do not have any visible ossicones on their heads, indicating the absence of these giraffe-like structures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the nesting dolls have elongated necks resembling those of giraffes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Nesting dolls typically have a rounded shape without extended features. In Image B, all nesting dolls appear to have standard nesting doll shape with rounded tops, except for the largest doll which has an elongated neck. This makes the largest doll resemble a giraffe's neck. The smaller dolls do not feature elongated necks.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Nesting dolls are traditionally arranged from largest to smallest. In Image B, observing the lineup of dolls on the wooden table, it is clear that they are arranged in descending sizes from left to right.",

      "question": "Do the nesting dolls have long legs resembling those of a giraffe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows nesting dolls that traditionally have a rounded base without any legs. Comparing this to a giraffe's long legs, it is evident that the nesting dolls do not feature any legs at all, distinguishing them from the giraffe's physical characteristic.",
