    "Question": "Q1: Is the skull face with grinning teeth and hollow eyes located on the rear fender of the motorcycle?",
    "explanation": "The motorcycle in Image B is a LEGO model, which lacks intricate decals and designs such as a skull face with grinning teeth and hollow eyes. The LEGO bricks are basic without any detailed printing. The rear fender in this LEGO model is represented by simple, undecorated pieces. Therefore, the skull face is not present on the rear fender.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a skull face with grinning teeth and hollow eyes positioned on the front headlight cowl?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO motorcycle does not have detailed decals, including a skull face on the front headlight cowl or any location. The front of the LEGO model is constructed from bricks without additional motifs or decorative elements. Thus, a skull face is not evident on the front headlight cowl.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Are the blue angular stripes present along the fuel tank, side panels, and front fairing in the same geometric configuration as in the original?",
    "explanation": "Image A features a more complex design with blue angular stripes. However, Image B, being a LEGO model, does not replicate these specific geometric patterns or color scheme, as it is limited to basic blue bricks. The overall design in Image B is much more simplified and lacks the distinct angular stripe patterns due to the nature of LEGO structures.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the “V-SDI” and “VFORCE3” decal visible on the lower side panel near the foot peg area?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO model does not include any decals or branding such as “V-SDI” and “VFORCE3” on the side panels because LEGO bricks do not feature such detailed graphic elements or inscriptions. The focus in LEGO models is on the construction itself rather than detailed branding.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the motorcycle shown in a side profile view facing toward the right side of the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO motorcycle is displayed in a clear side profile view facing to the right side of the image, evidenced by the orientation of the wheels and the handlebars. This setup indicates the motorcycle's direction is towards the right.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the exhaust pipe located beneath the seat and curving downward toward the rear wheel?",
    "explanation": "Given Image B, the LEGO model's construction does not intricately detail components like an exhaust pipe beneath the seat. LEGO models generally focus on the basic outline of objects, and such specific parts like an exhaust pipe with the particular placement and curvature are not depicted in the LEGO version of a motorcycle.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the seat have a smooth, slightly curved surface with a raised backrest?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the seat of the LEGO motorcycle is stylized with bricks, lacking a smooth, slightly curved surface typical of real motorcycle seats. The LEGO construction does not allow for detailed curvature or a raised backrest, resulting in a more angular and blocky seat profile.",
    "answer": "No"
