    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the subject’s left leg raised and held behind her back with both hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is depicted in a seated yoga pose with her arms raised above her head, while her legs are crossed. This indicates that her left leg is not raised or held behind her back with both hands. Image B does not show a standing pose or any leg being held up.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the sun located directly behind the subject’s torso, forming a halo-like glow around her silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration shows the subject sitting with the sun behind her creating a glow. The sun is positioned behind her head, resulting in a halo-like glow around her head rather than her torso.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the beach surface visibly wet, showing reflections of the sun and ocean waves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is an illustration that focuses on a simplistic depiction without realistic details such as reflections or wet surfaces. The beach surface does not appear wet or reflective; rather, it has a flat, stylized aesthetic typical of illustrations.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there two distinct rocky landforms visible in the background, one on the left and one on the right side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, only one rocky landform or silhouette is visible on the left side behind the seated figure. There is no indication of another distinct rocky landform on the right side in the image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the subject standing barefoot on the sand, with the sole of her right foot flat against the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is sitting cross-legged on the ground (presumably sand), and not standing. Therefore, her right foot is not flat against the ground in a standing position.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the subject’s hair tied into a neat bun at the back of her head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hair appears to be tied in a ponytail rather than a bun, as suggested by the ponytail hanging down past her neck. This conclusion is based on the visual depiction in the stylized illustration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the subject’s head tilted upward, with her face angled toward the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's head is facing forward and slightly inclined downward as she has her eyes closed in a meditative posture, which suggests relaxation rather than looking upward.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there visible ocean waves breaking along the shoreline in front of the subject?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature detailed visual elements such as ocean waves breaking along the shoreline. The background includes a simple illustration of the horizon and the sun, without detailed depictions of water dynamics.",
