    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the cardinal direction labels N, E, S, and W clearly visible and correctly positioned on the embossed compass face of the perfume bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the compass face is featured on the top of a perfume bottle. These cardinal direction labels are typically standard features on a compass, helping with navigation by showing the main directions at the center points of the compass design. However, upon close examination of the compass face, the traditional labels N, E, S, and W do not appear clearly, suggesting that they are either omitted or not distinct. The assessment is based solely on what is visible and not inferred from common formats if they are not present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the full 360-degree scale with numerical markings (e.g., 0, 90, 180, 270) present and evenly spaced around the outer edge of the embossed compass face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the outer edge of the compass face on the perfume bottle in Image B, the design intentionally mimics that of a compass, where such degree scales are critical for precise directional guidance. Nevertheless, upon inspection, there are no visible numerical markings that indicate the degrees around the edge of the compass face, hence the design lacks this specific detail.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the embossed compass face retain the original eight-pointed star-like radial pattern with symmetrical arms extending from the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the compass face has a radial design similar to classic star points commonly found in navigational compasses, serving both decorative and functional purposes. This pattern typically consists of an eight-pointed star, which is symbolic of its navigational function. Upon visual inspection, it retains a symmetrical star pattern, verifying the presence of such a design element.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the body of the perfume bottle perfectly circular in shape, matching the original compass’s outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body of the perfume bottle in Image B appears round by visual assessment, resembling the typical outline of the round compass seen in Image A. A circular shape ensures uniformity and aids in mimicking the compass's physical layout. The clearly curved edges confirm that the perfume bottle maintains a circular body shape, akin to the compass.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the cap of the perfume bottle feature engraved cartographic details such as a compass rose and intersecting grid lines, matching those seen on the map fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cap of the perfume bottle in Image B is smoothly polished and does not display any fine cartographic engravings like compass roses or grid lines that one might expect as a thematic extension of the map fragments or the compass. The simplicity of the cap contrasts directly with the more detailed embossing expected for such cartographic representation.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a small central raised dot or hub at the exact center of the embossed compass face, corresponding to the original needle pivot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the design of a compass, a central pivot or hub often facilitates needle mechanism placement. The investigation of the center of the perfume bottle’s embossed compass face in Image B reveals a central hub or dot that demonstrates attention to such detail, closely resembling the location where the original compass needle would pivot.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the outer ring of the embossed compass face clearly delineated with fine engravings and consistent spacing between degree marks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Careful inspection of the outer ring on the compass face of the perfume bottle in Image B shows a crafted design similar to compass engraving. However, the ring lacks fine engravings or degree marks, which would typically represent precision and accuracy on a navigational compass. The absence of defined, consistently spaced degree marks and engravings is evident from the image analysis.",
