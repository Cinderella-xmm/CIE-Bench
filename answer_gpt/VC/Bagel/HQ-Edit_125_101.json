      "question": "Is the dancer depicted in an arabesque leap with one leg extended behind and arms forming a diagonal line?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer inside the snow globe is designed in a ballet pose with one leg lifted and the arms held outwards. However, the pose appears more upright and not distinctly resembling the traditional arabesque leap, where one leg is extended back and arms usually form a long line. The posture shown is more of a standing pose rather than a leap with the leg behind.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the Eiffel Tower retain its characteristic iron lattice structure and three-tiered design with a spire at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower in the snow globe retains its characteristic appearance. The visual representation includes the iconic iron lattice structure and the three-tiered design, ending with a spire at the top, despite being a miniature replica.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are both feet of the dancer wearing pointe shoes with visible ribbons and box-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the dancer inside the snow globe is wearing ballet shoes typical to that of pointe shoes. They appear to have a structured design but without overly visible ribbons. The attire indicates ballerina shoes used for ballet poses.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the dancerâ€™s head turned to face the Eiffel Tower, indicating forward gaze toward it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer inside the snow globe appears to have a forward-facing posture, with the head facing forward as part of the ballet pose. However, the specific direction towards the Eiffel Tower is not distinctly suggested due to the frontal nature within the globe.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer situated within the snow globe wears a white ballet outfit. The attire closely resembles a tutu, which is common for ballet, and does not display the turquoise coloration mentioned.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the dancer positioned in the foreground, clearly in front of the Eiffel Tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the positioning within the snow globe is such that the dancer stands near the center, amid replicas of the Eiffel Tower. The dancer's presence is prominent due to the display style, but the phrasing suggests a comparison more akin to Image A, where a dancer leaps in front of an actual background. Here, the globe mixes foreground and background subjects together.",
