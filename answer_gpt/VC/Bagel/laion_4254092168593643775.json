    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the number \"7\" clearly visible on both the front fender and side panel of the motorcycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the graphic design is abstract and does not depict actual physical motorcycle details like numbers on fenders and panels. Instead, it focuses on stylized representations, such as colorful streaks and silhouettes, indicating speed and motion. World knowledge about motorcycle design tells us these details are usually found on actual motorcycles, but Image B's artistic style does not include such specifics. Therefore, the answer is based on the content of Image B, where no numbers are visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the track outline labeled \"5/5\" present in the upper-right corner of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features abstract art centered around a motorcycle theme, with colorful lines and shapes but does not include specific elements like track outlines or numerical labels such as '5/5'. This is consistent with the artistic style, which focuses on conveying movement and excitement rather than detailed information. Thus, there is no track outline labeled '5/5' in the upper-right corner.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the dust trail originate directly from the rear wheel of the motorcycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle is depicted as a silhouette, with the emphasis on dynamic lines and colors to suggest speed and motion. The abstract nature of the image steers away from realistic depictions like dust trails originating from wheels. Therefore, Image B does not show a dust trail stemming from the rear wheel.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the rider depicted in a forward-leaning posture with hands gripping the handlebars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the rider as a silhouette against a background of vibrant lines suggesting speed. Although the posture leans forward, typical of racing positions, specifics like hands gripping handlebars aren't depicted due to the stylized nature of the imageâ€”which focuses on motion rather than detailed physical accuracy.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the front wheel circular with a blue rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The artistic representation in Image B does not include detailed elements like a circular wheel with a blue rim. Instead, it focuses on an abstract silhouette design and bright colors, omitting specific features that would appear in realistic motorcycle imagery.",

      "question": "Is the rider positioned in the foreground with the desert landscape behind them and the track outline in the upper-right corner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses abstract elements to convey the idea of speed and motion through dynamic lines and a silhouette of a motorcyclist. There is no depiction of a desert landscape or track outline. The foreground is comprised of vibrant artistic lines rather than a detailed setting, addressing motion instead of environment.",
