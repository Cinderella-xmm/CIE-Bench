      "question": "Is the owl perched on a moss-covered branch with visible green moss texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area where the owl appears to be perched shows a textured surface consistent with a moss-covered branch. With the illumination around the owl’s perch spotlighting the details of the moss, it helps create a realistic setting. The greenish appearance and uneven texture hint at a natural moss formation. Given these visual cues, it's reasonable to conclude that the branch remains similar to what is often seen in such environments.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a small green plant with slender leaves growing next to the owl’s left side on the branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, to the left side of the owl, there is visible plant growth with slender green leaves that seem to sprout from or near the branch. This suggests the presence of small vegetation typical of a natural, mossy branch setting in a forest environment. These visual indicators, pairing the hues and attributes of the plant growth, align with expected small foliage.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background composed of dark, out-of-focus green foliage typical of a forest environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the background consists of mostly dark and out-of-focus elements. The inclusion of muted green tones hints at an environment that reflects a dimly lit forest area. This background illustrates a typical forest setting where depth and visual fuzziness are achieved by the natural light interplay and shadows in a forest environment.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the owl facing directly toward the camera with a slight head tilt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl is oriented towards the viewer, with its eyes positioned to look directly at the camera, creating an engaging and direct visual connection. While the head of the owl in this edited form might include artistic reinterpretations, the core focus remains similar to a stance where an owl maintains a slight head tilt for greater observational clarity.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the branch have a rough, textured surface covered in green moss with visible patches and crevices?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs visual details to enhance the branch's texture, suggesting the natural variations and roughness associated with a real-life moss-covered surface. The detailed pattern and irregularities emulate the natural divisiveness found in patches and crevices of moss on forest branches.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the lighting dim and natural, with subtle highlights on the owl’s feathers and eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting conveys an artistic reinterpretation with dynamic illumination that may not reflect standard natural lighting but conforms to a magical aesthetic. However, the highlights and glow around the owl's features serve to illuminate integral parts like the feathers, though not in a typical 'natural' sense as seen in forest environments. The intention is more stylistically creative than purely representational.",
