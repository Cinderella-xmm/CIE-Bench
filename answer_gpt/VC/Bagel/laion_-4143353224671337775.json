      "question": "Does the edited image retain the wide open mouth with visible white teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the object resembles a puzzle structure where different colored pieces fit together to form the body of an animal or creature. The visual structure of the mouth area shows a solid and smooth surface without any distinct opening or visible teeth, suggesting a closed or absent mouth feature. This contrasts with the description of a wide open mouth with visible white teeth.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object has a facial feature with what appears to be two black segments above where the eye sockets would logically be located.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

This green piece stands out against the other brown and beige pieces, confirming a green-colored section on the top.",
