      "question": "Are the moss-covered rock formations along the stream clearly visible and preserved in their original positions and shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B (the edited image), the scene is different from an actual forest setting; it has been transformed into a fantasy environment with glowing mushrooms and fairies. The moss-covered rock formations typical of a real forest, like the ones seen in Image A, are not present in the same form or position. Instead, what's visible are stylized rocks integrated into a more whimsical environment. Thus, the moss-covered formations are not preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the mossy boulders arranged in the same sequence along the stream as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a fantasy landscape where the natural elements have been replaced or altered. The boulders from Image A, which were covered in moss and naturally aligned along a stream, are replaced by stylized elements typical of fantasy art, such as mushrooms and fairy-like figures. This indicates the sequence and formation of boulders don't match the original arrangement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the pink flowers located in the lower right corner of the image present and unchanged in color and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited environment contrasts the realistic one in Image A and focuses on fantastical elements. The pink flowers visible in Image A's lower right corner are not present in Image B. Instead, the scene is filled with glowing mushrooms and fantastical colors that don't include the original flowers.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the light beams enter from the top center and spread downward in the same diagonal pattern as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the beams of light enter the forest diagonally, illuminating the scene with natural light. Image B, however, is a fantasy scene with glowing mushrooms featuring an artificial light source distinct from natural light beams. The lighting in Image B enters differently than in Image A, focusing on an ethereal glow, rather than diagonal beams.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there hanging vines extending from the upper branches of trees, particularly near the central canopy area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all elements are tailored toward creating an atmosphere of magical realism, as opposed to the jungle scene in Image A, which features hanging vines from tree canopies. Image B does not exhibit naturally-occurring hanging vines due to its stylized representation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the stream follow the same curved path with multiple small waterfalls over mossy rocks as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image B, the stream's path is represented whimsically. Image A features a realistic curved stream path with mossy rocks and waterfalls. Image B, however, stylizes the water flow, prioritizing luminous and less naturalistic features, thus not following the original curved path with multiple waterfalls over moss-covered rocks.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the green moss texture consistently applied to tree trunks and ground surfaces in the same way as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B transitions from a natural habitat to an imaginative, glowing forest scene. The edited representation reflects artistic creativity, lacking the consistent application of green moss texture characteristic of real forests like Image A. The surface textures in Image B emphasize illuminated mushrooms and fantastical elements rather than realistic moss coverage.",
