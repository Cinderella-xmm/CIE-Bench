    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the original grayish stone texture of the pyramid’s surface retained, including visible weathering and erosion patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the pyramid is depicted with a mystical design, featuring intricate vine patterns and a large eye at the pinnacle, indicating a fantastical and mythical aesthetic rather than the original gray stone texture. There are no signs of weathering or erosion, as the pyramid appears more ornate and symbolic in nature. Hence, the original stone texture is not retained.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the top platform of the pyramid preserved as a flat, rectangular structure with defined edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the pyramid features a giant eye, completely altering the original architecture. This makes it impossible for the top platform to maintain a flat, rectangular structure with defined edges as seen in traditional pyramids.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the central staircase remain aligned along the front face of the pyramid, extending from the top temple to the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible staircase extending from the top to the base as seen in traditional pyramidal structures. The focus is on the artistic embellishments and the presence of an eye at the top rather than traditional architectural elements like a central staircase.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there exactly nine distinct tiers visible in the pyramid’s structure, decreasing in size from bottom to top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiers of the pyramid are obscured or redesigned with the artistic and mythical elements. There is no clear view of nine distinct tiers, as the design focuses more on the elaborate patterns and eye motif rather than maintaining architectural accuracy.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are patches of moss and small vegetation visible along the edges and steps of the pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pyramid is adorned with stylized vines and vegetation that appear to be part of the artistic design rather than natural growths like moss or small vegetation. These elements are more decorative than actual moss, which would indicate natural overgrowth.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the shadow cast by the pyramid positioned to the lower right, consistent with sunlight coming from the upper left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadow effects are artistically directed to highlight the visual design elements rather than adhering to natural sunlight directions. The image focuses more on conceptual elements, making it challenging to analyze shadow positioning specific to sunlight direction.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the pyramid located in the center of a dense tropical jungle, with trees surrounding it on all sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the environment surrounding the pyramid is not depicted as a dense tropical jungle. Instead, it is set in a mystical or surreal environment with no trees visible around the pyramid, focusing more on the artistic environment created by vines and enchanting flora.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the top platform of the pyramid covered with dry soil and patches of moss, indicating natural overgrowth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a different design with a giant eye and artistic elements replacing any traditional platform or signs of natural overgrowth like dry soil and patches of moss. Therefore, these natural elements are not depicted.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Are there multiple white vehicles parked on the grassy area near the base of the pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any vehicles or grassy areas near the base of the pyramid. The focus is on the artistic presentation rather than realistic environmental features such as vehicles or a grass-covered base.",
