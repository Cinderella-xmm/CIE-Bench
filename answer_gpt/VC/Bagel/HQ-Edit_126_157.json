        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man in the frame has a visible long white beard.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character appears to be seated with his legs bent rather than cross-legged. The boat's dimensions and the seated posture indicate that while he seats directly in the center, his specific leg positioning is more aligned with being bent at the knees.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boat's design is shown with wooden planks that are arranged in a linear fashion. This arrangement can be observed from the detailed depiction carved onto the figurine in the frame, showcasing craftsmanship and structure typical of small boats.",

      "question": "Is the boat floating on a calm water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene within the frame is more representative rather than realistic, and it does not depict the boat directly floating on a visible liquid; rather, it uses symbolic representations of water. This kind of artistic depiction doesn't show physical floating on real water.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
