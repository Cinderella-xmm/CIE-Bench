    "Question": "Q1: Is the player depicted wearing a red shirt with black shorts in all frames?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the frames provide a stylized illustration of a tennis player, but due to the nature of the illustration, detailed color information such as the red shirt and black shorts is not represented; the player is shown in monochrome. Thus, without any color information, it's evident that Image B does not match the description provided in the question.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does each frame show the player dynamically engaged with the tennis racket and ball, mimicking a natural hitting motion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, each frame depicts a tennis player in a sequence of postures that could align with playing tennis. The positions of arms and legs suggest movements associated with hitting a ball, typical in tennis play. The gestures and stances are dynamic, resembling natural hitting motions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the racket and ball consistently positioned to indicate a realistic hitting action in every frame?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while the racket is visible in each frame, corresponding with different phases of a tennis swing, specific positioning of a ball isn't consistently illustrated in relation to the racket across all frames. The focus appears to be more on the player's form rather than interaction with a tennis ball in each frame.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the player retain his short dark hair in all frames of the sequence?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a stylized representation where specific hair details are uniform across different frames, but the black, illustrative lines don't convey color details like 'dark.' However, the hair's shape suggests a consistent style commensurate with short hair.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the yellow tennis ball appear consistently across all frames, maintaining its bright color and position relevance?",
    "explanation": "Image B is primarily monochrome, indicating the position of a tennis ball is not consistently illustrated across all frames. The focus is on form rather than a brightly colored tennis ball, and any position relevance is not explicitly detailed.",
    "answer": "No"
