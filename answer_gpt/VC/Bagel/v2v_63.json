      "question": "Is the woman's top still dusty rose in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi dolls are wearing tops similar to the woman in Image A. They resemble the original color, which is a dusty rose, identifiable by its soft, muted pinkish hue. The visual similarity in color indicates that the chibi dolls' tops continue to be the same dusty rose shade, confirmed by comparing the dolls' tops to the larger context of the original image.",

      "question": "Are the woman's pants still blue in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the chibi dolls in Image B, two dolls appear to be wearing blue pants that match the woman's attire in Image A. Since blue is a standard color often used for denim or similar materials, the visual match in hue and style suggests continuity in the pant color from Image A to Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi dolls exhibit hair that remains consistent with brown coloring. The details in hue correlate with typical characteristics of brown hair in terms of warmth and shade, much like the original image of the woman. This consistency across images suggests the hair color in the dolls remains unchanged.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the position of the TV still appears to be on a wooden support, similar to Image A. The presence of the TV and its base on a wood-textured surface in both images suggests that its placement continues to be on a wooden table.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi dolls do not depict a hand placed on the TV. Unlike Image A, which shows a hand resting on the TV edge, the arrangement of the dolls lacks a similar gesture, indicating a change in posture and placement of the hand.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The backdrop of Image B continues to reflect an off-white or light neutral tone established in Image A. The seamless nature of the wall color provides a consistent background matched in both images, indicating that the wall's coloring remains unchanged.",
