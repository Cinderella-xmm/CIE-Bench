      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, we observe four suitcases: three rectangular suitcases and one small suitcase on top. By counting the visual elements that appear to be suitcases, we can conclude that there are exactly four suitcases.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the suitcases are not stacked in the order specified. The suitcases include three rectangular ones stacked on top of each other and one small suitcase on top. This does not match the order given in the question.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image presents the figure in a frontal view rather than a side profile, as seen by the position of the body and orientation of the arms, suggesting that the figure is not facing left.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, we observe one human figure in the display case alongside the suitcases. This supports the conclusion that there is exactly one human figure in the image.",
