        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the second image depicts a culinary dish. There are no visible animals or skin textures depicted in this image as it features slices of cooked meat, sauce, and carrots, none of which show wrinkled gray skin. Considering the absence of the baby elephant and any skin texture, the conclusion is drawn that wrinkled gray skin texture is not present in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the baby elephant depicted with small ears compared to its body size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a plated dish with meat and carrots arranged artistically, which does not include any parts of an elephant such as ears or any body parts. Since Image B is focused on food presentation without depicting an elephant, it is clear that the baby elephant is not depicted at all, with its ears or otherwise.",

      "question": "Does the baby elephant retain a short trunk in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, displaying a culinary dish, does not feature any elephants or their characteristics. The plate of food has elements like sliced meat and carrots without any animal depiction. This confirms the absence of both the baby elephant and its trunk in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, vertical blue metal bars are not visible or depicted in any form. The image features a white plate with food items arranged in a circular pattern. Without the presence of blue metal bars or any elements resembling them, we can conclude that the edited image does not retain those features.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a culinary dish on a white plate, without any indication of a ground or dirt. The elements in this image are focused on food presentation, such as meat and carrots. Thus, there is no representation of a ground or any reddish dirt visible in Image B.",
