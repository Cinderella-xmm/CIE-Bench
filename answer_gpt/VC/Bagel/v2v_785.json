        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's hair color is not explicitly detailed in shades or highlights due to the stylized nature of manga art. However, the illustration employs a simplified color palette common in manga, where minimal, flat colors are used. The hair color appears to be depicted in a shade consistent with brown, typical for maintaining character consistency across formats.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is illustrated in a stylized manga format, retaining the bright red shirt worn in Image A. This consistent color choice helps in easily identifying the character across both images, despite the stylistic changes made in the manga adaptation.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the frisbee is shown in a bright yellow color, rather than bright green. The manga adaptation has altered the hue to yellow, possibly to fit the overall art style or color scheme better. Image A shows a bright green frisbee, making this a deliberate color change in the manga version.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's background illustrates a typical manga-style scenery with simplified grassy areas and tree-like elements, suggesting a park setting. By using green and blue tones, the background conveys a similar setting to the detailed park scene in Image A, maintaining consistency in the environmental depiction.",

      "question": "** Is the character shown interacting with the frisbee (holding it in Panel 1 and throwing it in Panel 2) in the manga adaptation?\n**",
      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the character in two scenarios with the frisbee: initially, in Panel 1, the character is suggesting engaging in an activity with the frisbee, which implies preparation to use it. In Panel 2, the character is actively throwing the frisbee, as shown by the dynamic pose and motion lines. This interaction mimics the concept established in Image A, where the character is holding a frisbee.",
