      "question": "Is the floral/paisley pattern in red-brown tones with green trim present on the jacket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jacket does not feature a floral/paisley pattern in red-brown tones with green trim. The jacket has a more muted brown pattern without the highlighted green trim. The analysis involves visually identifying the overall pattern and color scheme, comparing it to known patterns like floral designs.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the symmetrical teal triangular appliqués positioned near the hem of the pale blue-gray skirt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no teal triangular appliqués near the hem of the skirt. The skirt has a consistent pattern without additional appliqué detailing. This is determined by examining the lower part of the skirt for any visible symmetrical triangular accents.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is a teal ribbon tied in a bow at the waist of the jacket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no teal ribbon tied in a bow at the waist of the jacket. The waist lacks additional ties or ribbons. This conclusion is drawn from observing the waist area of the jacket and noting any additional decorative elements.",

      "question": "Does the jacket have flared sleeves and a wide collar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jacket appears to have more fitted sleeves rather than flared ones and lacks a wide collar. The collar is narrow and lace-trimmed, which is detected upon inspecting the sleeve shape and collar details.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, neither a green trim nor teal appliqués are present. The jacket has a consistent brown pattern, and the skirt lacks decorative teal accents, making hue comparison irrelevant.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jacket displays a series of buttons down the center with lace trimmings, not just two buttons. The analysis is based on the visibility of the buttons on the jacket front.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Are there visible vertical folds and draping in the skirt fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skirt appears more structured with less prominent vertical folds and draping. The distinction comes from observing the texture and flow of the skirt fabric.",
