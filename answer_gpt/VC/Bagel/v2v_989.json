      "question": "Is the dog depicted with a black coat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is clearly illustrated with a dark coat, consistent with the stylized design. This depiction involves simple, bold lines typical of illustrations which often emphasize key features like color. Although the dog's features are simplified, there is a clear intention of representing a black coat. Given that this representation matches the coloring principle of the image, it is reasonable to conclude the dog's coat is black.",

      "question": "Is the dog shown in a relaxed, lying-down posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dog in Image B is drawn in a lying-down posture, which is identifiable by its body orientation and position. The dog's legs are curled inwards, and its head rests peacefully on the ground, suggesting a state of rest. This interpretation is based on the visual cues that depict relaxation stance, commonly associated with a lying-down position.",

      "question": "Is the bench depicted in green?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the bench in a stylized form with bold lines and monochrome colors. It lacks any color tones to suggest green, appearing instead as black or dark in this illustrated format. The simplification often employed in illustrations to provide clear shapes and definitions means color detail is reduced, thus excluding the possibility of the representation being green.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the dog positioned next to the bench?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is illustrated directly in front of the bench, resting alongside the central line of sight but not adjacent to or directly touching it. It is situated at the base, resting against the ground next to the bench, rather than being depicted in separation from the bench. Using common sense and alignment principles often used in illustrations, this placement matches the idea of 'next to.'",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the radio, juice box, and trash bag are prominently illustrated placed together on the bench. This direct placement is consistent with the organization seen in the original Image A. The bench hosts these items collected adjacent to one another which validates their presence directly upon the bench itself, depicted cohesively without modification in placement.",
