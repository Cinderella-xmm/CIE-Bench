      "question": "Are the printed texts on both open pages still clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the printed texts on the open pages of the book are clearly visible. The image is focused and the text retains its legibility, suggesting that lighting and camera focus were appropriate for capturing the text details. The use of good focus and lighting typically ensures that text remains clear in photography.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the book cover still visibly pinkish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book cover retains a pinkish hue. This is determined by observing the edges of the book, where the pinkish color of the cover is slightly visible. Typically, a pinkish color is distinct and can be recognized even in subtle exposures.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the wooden background with its natural texture and grain patterns intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden background is still visible with its natural texture and grain patterns. These details are discernible through the visible surface of the table, which shows the characteristic lines and patterns associated with natural wood. Such patterns are fundamental characteristics of wood textures and are easily recognized.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the book still open with the pages aligned logically on the wooden surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book is observed to be open, with the pages nicely spread out across a wooden surface. The alignment appears logical, as seen in a typical open book scenario where pages fan open from the spine and rest evenly on a surface.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the pages retain their beige color and slightly aged texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pages of the book appear to have a beige color and exhibit a texture that can be associated with being slightly aged. This conclusion is drawn from the observation of the hue and visible texture that resemble typical aging in paper, which often results in a warmer, beige tone.",
