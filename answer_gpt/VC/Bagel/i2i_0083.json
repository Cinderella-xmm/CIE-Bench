      "question": "Are the armchairs upholstered in brown fabric with light wooden legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armchairs are visually identifiable as upholstered in brown fabric, as the color and texture align with common fabric appearance. The legs appear to be made of wood that is lighter in color compared to the upholstery, which is consistent with typical light wooden furniture legs. This analysis is based solely on the visual cues present in Image B without needing comparison with Image A for verification.",

      "question": "Are the armchairs placed symmetrically on either side of the central display area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two armchairs positioned on either side of a central display area, which is occupied by a digital screen. Their placement is symmetrical as they are equidistant from the screen, a common method of arranging furniture to create visual balance in a room. Therefore, based on visual symmetry and typical placement practices, the armchairs are placed symmetrically.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the wall behind the armchairs a plain white surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall behind the armchairs appears to be white and unadorned except for the center display area. The plain nature is inferred from the absence of any additional decorations or textures visible on the wall surface around the screen. This typical wall color choice supports a clean, minimalist room design.",

      "question": "Does the floor have a glossy polished wood texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floor in Image B exhibits characteristics of polished wood, such as visible wood grain and a sheen that reflects light, which are indicative of a glossy finish. These visual elements suggest the floor's texture is akin to polished wood flooring, a common choice for living spaces aiming for a refined aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there soft shadows cast beneath the armchairs on the floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays shadows that appear to be soft beneath the armchairs, suggesting diffused light creating subtle gradations from the legs outward. This shadowing effect typically results from indoor lighting or natural lighting diffused through windows, adding depth to the room's visual structure.",
