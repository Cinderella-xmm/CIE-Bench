    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the fish depicted in a continuous, coiled circular posture with its head pointing toward the upper right and tail curving beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the fish is depicted in a more straightforward, upright swimming posture instead of a coiled posture. The tail runs horizontally behind the body instead of curving beneath it in a circular fashion. Therefore, based on its visual presentation, the posture is not continuous and coiled.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there three distinct barbels extending from the lower jaw of the fish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fish in the edited image (Image B) does not have any visible barbels extending from its jaw. This is a crystal sculpture, focusing more on stylized features like scales and fins rather than small details like barbels.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the dorsal fin located along the upper back of the fish and shaped with a serrated edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the dorsal fin is indeed located along the upper back of the fish, and it features a sharp or serrated edge. This is a typical representation in fish design to depict realism.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the scales arranged in overlapping rows along the body of the fish, running from head to tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) clearly shows the fish's scales arranged in overlapping rows, running from the head to the tail. This arrangement is typical for depicting fish scales to create a texture and realistic pattern.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the tail of the fish curve underneath the body and connect near the head, completing a nearly full circle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the fish's tail does not curve underneath the body to create a nearly full circle. Instead, it is depicted in a more straightforward arrangement without the circular connection between the tail and head.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there two pectoral fins visible on the side of the fish, one near the head and one further back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows a single pectoral fin near the bodyâ€™s midsection. The posture and angle do not reveal a second fin further back, consistent with the position and rendering style of the crystal design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the fish carving contained within a square-shaped panel with rounded corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) does not feature the fish within a square panel. Instead, the fish sculpture stands alone without any surrounding panel. In contrast, the original image clearly shows the fish carved on a wooden panel with rounded corners.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
