      "question": "Are the wooden truss supports of the railway bridge clearly visible and structurally intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no clear depiction of wooden truss supports for a railway bridge. The illustration has a neon, digital art style showing a schematic city skyline that lacks specific structural details like wooden truss supports. This absence and the stylized nature of the image indicate that the truss supports are not clearly visible nor depicted as intact.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a futuristic city skyline in a neon blue and pink palette without any specific architectural details such as red-brick buildings with gabled roofs and chimneys, which are found in traditional architecture and not typically represented in such a digital art style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B only displays a stylized city skyline without natural elements such as a river or a bridge. There is no depth order involving a river or bridge to assess, as the focus is solely on the vertical cityscape in a neon depiction.",

    },
    {

      ],
