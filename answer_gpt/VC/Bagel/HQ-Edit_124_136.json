      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts a figure seated with legs positioned parallelly, beneath blue robes, not in a cross-legged position. The logic relies on identifying positional attributes of the clothing and considering typical cultural portrayals seated with robes.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the right hand positioned above the strings in a plucking gesture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the figure's right hand is positioned near the strings of the instrument, likely using a plucking gesture, based on its proximity and traditional playing posture of lutes or similar string instruments.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows the left hand around the neck of the instrument, which, being indicative of playing, involves finger placement likely pressing the strings. This reasoning follows typical hand positions required for instrument manipulation.",

      "is_correct": true
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure appears to face directly forward with the head in a stable, neutral position, not indicating any tilt when considering the symmetrical and frontal presentation. The bias is toward imagining a portrait style presentation typical in iconography.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The beard and mustache in the edited image appear extensive and flowing, which aligns with common portrayals of venerable figures or clergy, using ample facial hair indicating wizened appearances.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the figure wearing a brown, textured turban?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the color and texture in the edited image reveals a vibrant blue rather than brown for the figure. Considering traditional elements, mosaiced and ornate presentations often favor vibrant colors and uniformity for distinguishing sacred imagery.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a visible soundboard area on the instrument?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The detailed area of the instrument's face, showing a distinct section underneath the strings, indicates a typical soundboard layout. Combining knowledge of lute construction confirms the visual design emphasizing soundboard presence.",
