    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the red velvet cushion with visible quilted texture present beneath the saxophone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is not on a saxophone but a dragon/serpent resting on a red cushion. Despite the change, the cushion maintains its quilted texture appearance similar to the original image. This analysis is based on observing the visible tufting and fabric quality present under the dragon/serpent.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a thin gold trim running along the outer edge of the red cushion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cushion beneath the dragon/serpent shows a decorative detail along the edge that resembles a gold trim, effectively maintaining consistency with the styling of Image A's cushion observed under the saxophone.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the lighting source positioned above the saxophone, creating a bright central glow that fades into darkness toward the edges of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a dragon/serpent instead of a saxophone, yet the lighting arrangement remains centralized above, crafting a bright halo effect at the top and gradually diminishing into shadows, comparable to the lighting seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the saxophone (or transformed serpent) positioned diagonally across the cushion, extending from the lower left to the upper right of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon/serpent rests in a diagonal orientation on the cushion, mirroring the saxophone's alignment from Image A. The coiled body extends in a similar diagonal manner from the lower left towards the upper right part of the frame.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting maintains a uniform dark backdrop akin to a theatrical display, devoid of any other objects or textures, ensuring that the focus is solely on the central subject under the spotlight, akin to the setup in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the transformed serpent retain a highly reflective, metallic surface with visible highlights and specular reflections consistent with polished brass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's transformed serpent does not exhibit the reflective brass surface of the saxophone in Image A. Instead, it displays a scaly, textured surface characteristic of mythical creatures or reptiles, lacking the metallic sheen and specular reflections associated with polished brass.",
