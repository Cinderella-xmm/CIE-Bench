      "question": "Is the background still showing the red train and metallic fence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is composed of a red train and a metallic fence. Based on common sense, trains usually have a consistent color and similar structure during edits, unless there is a specific change called for. Thus, observantly recognizing the presence of a red train and metal fence confirms that these features remain unchanged in the background.",

      "question": "Does the worker still wear the neon yellow vest with orange reflective stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual inspection of Image B shows the worker wearing a neon yellow vest with orange reflective stripes. These are typical safety features designed to enhance visibility, especially for workers near traffic or in construction zones. Given the color and appearance, it is reasonable to conclude that the vest is the same as in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the worker still holding the phone up to their ear in the same posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the worker's posture suggests that they have their arm raised towards their ear, which implies holding a phone. Given that this is a standard position for engaging in a call, it indicates that the posture remains unchanged.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is a distinct yellow hard hat visible on the worker's head. Hard hats are essential safety gear for construction or maintenance workers, so it remains consistent in the post-edit version.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the worker is seen wearing green shorts with orange pants underneath, visible below the neon yellow vest. This combination is typical for high-visibility work attire, often providing contrast and layered protection, indicating no change from the original.",
