        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no player depicted with a clear jersey and number visible on the back. Instead, the image features cartoon-like figures. Therefore, the number '18' is not visible at all.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, none of the cartoon-like players have the number '18' on their jersey visible, as only the letters 'A' and 'M' are present. Hence, the number '18' is not visible on the front left side of the player's jersey.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts cartoon-like players, each wearing blue jerseys and blue caps with different letters and no black brim visible. Therefore, there is no depiction of a purple jersey or purple cap with a black brim.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoonish figures do not appear to be holding black baseball bats at all. Therefore, there is no depiction of the player holding a black baseball bat with both hands.",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoon-like figures in Image B are not in a realistic batting stance; instead, they are portrayed in action poses without clear, bent knees or a twisted torso. Therefore, the description of a crouched batting stance does not apply.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon-like figures do not visually display the action of gripping a bat near the handle with both hands. The setting is more illustrative and does not focus on that specific detail.",
