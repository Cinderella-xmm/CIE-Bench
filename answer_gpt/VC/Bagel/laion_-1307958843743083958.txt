    "Question": "Q1: Are the cheetahs in a seated position with bent hind legs, tucked tails, and upright front paws?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not depict cheetahs but rather features a set of perfume bottles. The visual cues in the second image include sleek, minimalistic designs of bottles that resemble human-like structures rather than animal figures. Therefore, regarding the pose and positioning of cheetahs, it is not applicable to Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the head of each cheetah turned slightly to the side, away from the central divider?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no representations of cheetahs. Instead, the central object is a green perfume bottle, not associated with any animal depiction. Therefore, analyzing the position of a cheetah's head is not relevant.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does each cheetah rest on a two-tiered base with a black upper section and a bronze-colored stepped lower section?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not include any form of structure or base that can be likened to a two-tiered pedestal intended for a figurine such as a cheetah. The objects in the image are perfume bottles with no visible tiers like the ones described.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the cheetah figures positioned symmetrically, one on the left and one on the right, equidistant from the center?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement is of three perfume bottles, with one central bottle and two others on either side. While the bottles are symmetrically arranged, they do not relate to cheetah figures; hence the concept of cheetahs equidistant from the center does not apply.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there exactly three vertical panels positioned between the cheetahs, with two narrower ones flanking a wider central one?",
    "explanation": "Instead of panels, Image B consists of containers of perfume. There's a pattern of a separate green bottle positioned centrally, giving a semblance of panels perhaps. However, no narrower or wider panels exist, as described with cheetahs.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the tail of each cheetah curve upward and rest on the base behind the body?",
    "explanation": "There are no cheetahs present in Image B, meaning there are neither tails nor bases upon which such tails could curve and rest. The image represents perfume bottles, lacking any animal characteristics.",
    "answer": "No"
