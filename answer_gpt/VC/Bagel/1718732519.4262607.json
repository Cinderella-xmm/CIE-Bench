      "question": "Is the hot dog represented as an elongated, straight object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elongated object consists of red and yellow LEGO bricks. These bricks form a streamlined shape with straight edges typical in LEGO designs, resembling the form of a hot dog bun enclosing a sausage. Therefore, the object is straight and elongated. Combining knowledge of how LEGO constructions work with this observation, the hot dog is depicted as elongated and straight.",

      "question": "Is the hot dog placed horizontally on the wooden base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO representation of the hot dog in Image B is placed on a wooden platform in a horizontal manner. Observing the orientation of the bricks forming the hot dog shape, it spans horizontally across the platform, reflecting common knowledge of placement for such foods. Hence, the hot dog is horizontally placed.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are both the hot dog and the bottle placed on a flat wooden surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals two separate items—a LEGO hot dog and a LEGO bottle—each placed on distinct flat wooden surfaces. The colorful LEGO bottle rests on its own platform, while the LEGO hot dog sits horizontally on a separate wooden platform. Based on visual observation and understanding of typical object placement in imagery, both items are indeed positioned on wooden surfaces, though distinct from each other.",

      "question": "Is the bottle positioned to the left of the hot dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bottle, characterized by its colorful pattern, is positioned adjacent to the LEGO hot dog on the same wooden base. Observing the relative position, the bottle is visually situated to the left of the horizontally-placed LEGO hot dog within the confines of the image frame. Hence, according to the spatial arrangement observed, the bottle is positioned left of the hot dog.",

      "question": "Is the hot dog placed on a raised wooden platform distinct from the main table surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden base in Image B houses both the LEGO hot dog and a colorful LEGO object. The crafted base, made of wood, elevates these LEGO items distinctly above any main surface they may rest upon. Common knowledge of platforms and object distinction in photography suggests the hot dog is indeed placed in a raised manner distinct from any primary surface, reflecting its presentation style.",
