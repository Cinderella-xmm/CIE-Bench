      "question": "Is the overall shape of the food arrangement a perfect heart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of Lego pieces forms a rough heart shape. The pieces are organized to suggest a heart but lack the smooth, symmetrical curves of a perfect heart due to the angular and jagged edges of the Lego pieces. Commonly, a perfect heart shape is smooth and symmetrical, which is not fully achieved with the Lego format.",

      "question": "Is the avocado shown as half-cut with the pit cavity visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible avocado with a pit cavity. The image shows a colorful arrangement of Lego pieces that might use green pieces to suggest vegetables or fruit, but without detailing that specifically represents an avocado half with a pit cavity.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the asparagus stalks bundled together with a visible twine-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no recognizable asparagus stalks or a twine-like structure. The arrangement is made of Lego blocks, and typical features such as the specific green color or the texture of asparagus are not present or detailed with a twine structure.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries grouped together at the top-left of the heart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top-left area of the heart is occupied by colorful Lego blocks that vaguely mimic fruits, but there are no distinct individual pieces that clearly represent blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries. The Lego representation lacks the detailed visual cues of specific berries.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a single red onion positioned near the broccoli and garlic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an abstract representation using various colors of Lego blocks, but there is no visible object or arrangement that directly shows a red onion near a broccoli and garlic, as this requires specific shapes and colors that Lego blocks do not distinctly provide.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there at least three white mushrooms grouped together near the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central area features colorful Lego blocks, but there are no clear formations that resemble white mushrooms. The Lego blocks do not have specific qualities such as a rounded top or stem that would typically be used to depict mushrooms realistically.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a large red bell pepper at the bottom-right of the heart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, towards the bottom-right, there are some red Lego pieces, but they do not collectively form the shape of a red bell pepper. The bell pepper's recognizable shape and features are not depicted through the Lego arrangement.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the background a neutral gray surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a pixelated, blurry pattern in shades of gray, matching the description of a neutral gray surface. This differs from the wooden background in Image A.",
