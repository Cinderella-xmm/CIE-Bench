    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the small structure with a blue roof still present at the highest point of the ridge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a prominent green dragon covering most of the landscape, but upon closer observation, the small structure with a blue roof can still be seen at the highest point of the ridge in the background, similar to its appearance in Image A. This suggests that the structure's location has not changed.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the hikers still visible along the central trail, maintaining their original positions relative to the path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central trail is partially obscured by the dragon's body. This blockage prevents the visibility of hikers along certain sections of the trail, though some hikers might still be visible in unobscured sections. In Image A, hikers were clearly visible along the entire path. Thus, due to the dragon's overlap in Image B, the original positions of hikers are not all preserved.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the ridge maintain its original undulating shape, forming a continuous elevated backbone from foreground to background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon's body follows the path of the ridge, but the visual continuity of the ridge is interrupted by the dragon's presence. Although the terrain itself remains unchanged under the dragon, the visual perception of a continuous ridge is disrupted compared to the clearer view in Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the trees and shrubs on the slopes of the ridge still present in their original locations and densities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while some parts of the dragon cover certain areas of the slope, the visible sections show that the density and arrangement of trees and shrubs remain largely intact compared to Image A. Therefore, in areas not obscured by the dragon, the original vegetation appears unchanged.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sky still uniformly overcast with soft, diffused lighting, matching the original tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky remains uniformly overcast, which aligns with the sky's appearance in Image A. There is no addition of any elements that would alter the lighting or tone relative to Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the grassy areas on both sides of the path still green and undisturbed, retaining their original texture and color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grassy areas are partially obstructed by the dragon but appear unchanged in texture and color where they are visible. Compared to Image A, the grassy areas not covered by the dragon maintain their green appearance and texture.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the distant hills still visible in the background, fading into mist as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the distant hills are mostly obscured by the dragon, making them largely invisible compared to Image A, where they were clearly visible and fading into mist. Therefore, the appearance of the distant hills is significantly altered.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are the rocky outcrops at the lower edge of the ridge still visible in their original positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower edge of the image is obscured by the large dragon, which covers the area where the rocky outcrops were visible in Image A, making it impossible to see them.",

      "model_answer": "No",
