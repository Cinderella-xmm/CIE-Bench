    "Question": "Q1: Does the chibi character maintain the exact martial arts pose, including the forward leg stance and outward-facing palms?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character appears seated within a pink frame rather than standing, which is significantly different from a martial arts pose. The hands are positioned upward, which partially matches the outward-facing palms, but the leg stance is completely different as the character is sitting with legs folded. Therefore, the chibi character does not maintain the original stance.",
