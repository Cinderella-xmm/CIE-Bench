      "question": "Is the \"S\" emblem present on the chest of the character, with a shield shape, red outer border, yellow/gold inner field, and red \"S\" lettering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 'S' emblem on the chest of the character appears to be present. It is centrally located and has a design consistent with Superman's emblem, featuring a shield shape. In Image B, while the inner field may not be distinctly yellow/gold, it includes a stylized 'S' in red, similarly bordered. Based on common superhero costume designs, this matches the description despite stylistic differences from Image A.",
