      "question": "Does the edited image retain the airplane's wings, engines, and tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the airplane has been transformed into a cartoonish version with exaggerated features, such as large eyes and a smile. The visible elements include wings, engines, and tail, albeit stylized for aesthetic appeal. The cartoonish representation maintains these components to resemble an airplane, indicating the retention of these parts despite a change in visual style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the airplane still positioned on the runway in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cartoon airplane directly on the runway in a similar setting to Image A. This is supported by the visible ground level and alignment, suggesting continuation of the runway environment, demonstrating that the airplane remains positioned on it.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image still feature a golden sunset background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a background consistent with the warm, golden hues typical of a sunset. The similarity in color and lighting conveys a sunset ambiance. Common visual knowledge supports the identification of such scenes as indicative of sunset lighting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the runway markings (\"10\" and guiding lines) still visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no specific runway markings or numbers like '10' are visible. While the airplane appears to be on a runway, the edited image omits these precise markers, focusing instead on the cartoon representation and festive embellishments.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the horizon line with distant tree silhouettes still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a clear horizon line or the distant silhouette of trees present in Image A. The visual focus is directed more on the cartoon airplane and decorative elements rather than the distant landscape view. A distinct lack of horizon details supports the absence of these features.",
