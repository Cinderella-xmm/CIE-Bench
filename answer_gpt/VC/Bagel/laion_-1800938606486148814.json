      "question": "Is the Swoosh logo present in the same curved shape and located on the lateral side of the midsole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Swoosh logo is present on the lateral side of the shoe, similar to Image A. In both images, the Swoosh retains a curved shape. The position is on the lateral side of the shoe's upper rather than specifically highlighting its placement on the midsole. Hence, the curved shape and lateral positioning remain consistent.",
