      "question": "Are the eyes almond-shaped and positioned symmetrically on the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which is edited to showcase a chibi character style, facial features tend to be simplified and exaggerated. Typically, chibi characters have large, rounded or oval eyes that may not resemble natural almond-shaped eyes. Based on visual cues in Image B, such as the simple and stylized representation, the eyes do not have an almond shape and seem to be positioned centrally but exaggerated for the style.",

      "question": "Are there small gold hoop earrings present in both ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, following a chibi art style, often does not focus on intricate details like earrings unless emphasized for a specific reason. Based on the visual cues given, the edited image appears too simplified to display such fine details as small gold hoop earrings unless they were deliberately exaggerated.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the right hand placed inside the front pocket of the trousers with fingers visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characterâ€™s right hand is positioned with a hand inside the pocket of the trousers. However, chibi characters often have simplified features, and the hand is depicted more as a solid shape rather than detailed fingers being visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the hair have a natural, wavy curl pattern falling over the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi art style in Image B represents hair in a stylized manner that alludes to curls or waves. While the edited image does show a semblance of curls, they are exaggerated and more graphic, lacking the natural curl detail typical in a real-life depiction.",

      "question": "Is the head slightly tilted forward toward the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In chibi-style artwork, character poses and head angles are relatively straightforward. The head is positioned as part of the larger stylized representation and does not appear to tilt forward towards the camera.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a stylized outfit with simplified details. The blouse in the edited image does incorporate a semblance of a V-neckline by the collar's positioning. Buttons are visually indicated down the center, an element kept from the original with simplified representation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the trousers have a high waist with a visible waistband seam and belt loops?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows chibi figures wearing trousers. While the waist is portrayed at a higher position characteristic of high-waist pants, the edited illustration lacks intricate details such as the clear depiction of waistband seams and belt loops due to stylization.",
