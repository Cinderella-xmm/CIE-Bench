      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, on the right sleeve of the subject's top, there is a noticeable cheetah face graphic. The sleeve has a leopard print pattern and incorporates a face design, which is visually distinct due to its arrangement and coloring that matches the cheetah theme.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both boxing gloves are displayed in a metallic gold color, and the yellow laces are visible, confirming their presence. The gloves' bright, reflective nature is typical for gold-colored accessories, and the laces are a contrasting yet complementary detail.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the leopard print pattern is clearly visible on the sleeves of the top worn by the subject.
