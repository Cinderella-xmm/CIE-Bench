      "question": "Is the white and red color scheme of the train retained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train features a distinct white and red color scheme that is clearly visible on its body. This color combination is commonly associated with modern trains and has been maintained in the edited image. The visual cues suggest that the color scheme has not changed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the train remain on a suitable track or elevated system, consistent with the maglev design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the train appears to be directly on the sandy beach, without any visible track or elevated system typically associated with maglev trains. Maglev trains operate on specially designed tracks to function correctly, which is not visible in the image, suggesting inconsistency with typical design requirements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background environment, including the horizon and setting, largely consistent with the original scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A features a beach setting with visible sand, water, and horizon line, which is retained in Image B. The edited image continues to display these elements, indicating the environment and setting, such as the sandy beach and horizon, remain consistent between the images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the lighting and shadows consistent with those in the original image, preserving the realistic look of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the shadows are cast in a specific direction consistent with the lighting, while Image B also shows shadows cast in the same direction over the same type of terrain. However, the shadow underneath the train doesnâ€™t align naturally due to the lack of a track, suggesting the lighting consistency isn't entirely preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the train maintain realistic proportions and scale in relation to its surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Trains are typically large compared to their surroundings, especially on a beach setting. Image B presents the train on the beach without apparent adjustment to scale. Based on common knowledge about beach environments, the proportions appear unrealistic, as the train would dwarf the scale suggested by the beach context without tracks.",
