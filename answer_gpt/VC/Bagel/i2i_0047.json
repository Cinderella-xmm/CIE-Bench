      "question": "Is the train still primarily painted in blue-purple with a yellow front and red doors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background and overall elements have transitioned to a neon-lit, futuristic theme. There is no explicit detail of a train visible, as the focus is on a person surrounded by vibrant neon lights. Without a visible train, it can't be concluded that a train painted in blue-purple with a yellow front and red doors exists in this specific context.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The second image projects a futuristic scene dominated by neon lights with no discernible train features like windows or doors, preventing a comparison of position and shape relative to Image A's train.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The train tracks present in Image A are completely replaced in Image B with a neon-lit urban setting with no visible train tracks, rendering the comparison impossible.",
