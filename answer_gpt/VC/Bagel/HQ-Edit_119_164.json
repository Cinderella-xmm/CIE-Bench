      "question": "Are the flat-topped acacia trees visible in the background, maintaining their characteristic silhouette and spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background does not feature any acacia trees. Instead, the scene involves a surreal representation of an elephant surrounded by cosmic elements and planets, with no trees visible. In Image A, acacia trees are clearly present and positioned around the landscape. Therefore, Image B does not maintain the characteristic silhouette or spacing of acacia trees.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the tall, golden-brown savanna grass present throughout the foreground and midground, matching the original texture and density?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents an elephant adorned with a cosmic theme, where the ground does not show golden-brown savanna grass. The ground is dark, possibly representing a night sky or cosmic plane. However, Image A features golden-brown savanna grass which is vital to its representation. Therefore, Image B does not match the original texture and density of savanna grass.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sky display a continuous gradient from warm orange near the horizon to deep red and purple at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a night sky with elements of space, having a dark character with celestial lights. In contrast, Image A does have a continuous gradient of warm colors transitioning from orange to red and purple. Therefore, Image B does not display the gradient as described.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the horizon line clearly visible and straight, dividing the sky from the savanna landscape at approximately one-third up the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an indication of a horizon, but it's more stylized and blends into a cosmic setting, rather than clearly dividing a sky from a landscape. Image A has a distinct horizon line visible, dividing the sky from the savanna. Image B does not have a straight and conventional horizon line as described.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighting consistent with a low-angle sunset, producing warm highlights on the upper surfaces of the elephant and grass, and casting long shadows behind the subject?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes a cosmic theme where the lighting resembles a supernatural glow rather than the natural warm highlights produced by a sunset. The elephant is illuminated by cosmic lights rather than sunset highlights. Image A presents a clear sunset light casting warm highlights, therefore Image B does not maintain this lighting consistency with a low-angle sunset.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the elephant positioned centrally in the frame, facing directly toward the viewer with its body aligned vertically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image B and Image A, the elephant is positioned centrally and faces directly toward the viewer. Hence, the alignment and positioning criteria are met in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there no visible water bodies, rocky outcrops, or other animals in the background beyond the acacia trees and grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the surreal theme in Image B, there are no representations of water bodies, rocky outcrops, or other animals visible in the background, maintaining a focus on the celestial elements around the elephant. Image A also does not feature any of these elements beyond acacia trees and grass. Thus, Image B meets this criterion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Do the grass blades in the foreground show individual strands with slight variation in length and direction, contributing to a natural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature grass blades or illustrate variations in their texture; instead, it features a cosmic setting around the elephant. In contrast, Image A includes a detailed depiction of grass blades. Therefore, Image B does not match the description of varied grass texture.",
