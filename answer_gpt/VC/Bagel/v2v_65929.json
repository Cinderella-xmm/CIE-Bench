    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the spatial arrangement and relative positions of the machinery consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the machinery is decorated with candy-themed elements, but their relative positions and arrangement remain identical to those in Image A. By observing the layout and structure of the machinery in both images, we can confirm that despite the aesthetic transformation, the spatial consistency is preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the ceiling trusses still providing structural support in the same manner as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the visual transformation into a candyland theme, the ceiling trusses remain visible and appear to maintain their structural function as in Image A. They stretch across the top, providing support for the roof, consistent with the industrial setting required for such a facility.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the overall proportions and layout of the room match the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall dimensions and layout of the room in Image B, though transformed into a playful candy theme, maintain the same proportions and spatial layout as in Image A. The width, length, and placement of machinery and ceiling structures remain consistent, indicating no alteration in structural layout.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the position and extent of the wall (now transformed into gingerbread) consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wall in Image B, despite being visually transformed into gingerbread, retains the same position and extent as seen in Image A. The wall's placement along the same axis and its vertical alignment are mirrored accurately, showing consistency.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the floor (now a river of chocolate) still serve as a base for the machinery in the same way as the original concrete floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floor is reimagined as a river of chocolate, which conceptually differs from the original's solid concrete base. This transformation suggests a change in the functional aspect of the floor as it visually loses the solid nature necessary to support heavy machinery, unlike the concrete floor in Image A.",
