    "Question": "Q1: Is the detailed texture of the elephant's skin, showing wrinkles and creases, preserved in the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is depicted as a smooth, monochromatic silhouette with no texture details such as wrinkles or creases. In contrast to what would be expected from a real elephant, which typically has a wrinkled and textured skin, the image uses a simplified, smooth appearance, indicating the texture is not preserved.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the elephant's posture, including the raised front leg and curved trunk, retained in the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette of the elephant does show a similar posture to what would be considered in Image A. The front leg appears slightly lifted, and the trunk is curved downwards. These elements suggest that the posture is indeed retained in the edited image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the proportions of the elephant's ears and trunk, consistent with its young age, maintained in the image?",
    "explanation": "The silhouette in Image B retains the proportions that are generally consistent with a young elephant: relatively large ears and a proportionally sized trunk indicative of youth. Although details are minimal, the overall shape suggests that these proportions are maintained.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the elephant positioned on the rock edge, with its legs and trunk maintaining their relative placement to the rock surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant does appear to be positioned in a way that suggests it is standing on the edge of a surface, with its legs and trunk aligned closely to a ground plane. This matches the positioning observed in Image A, where the elephant is seen standing on the rock edge.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the elephant face towards the right side of the image, preserving its profile orientation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette of the elephant is oriented so that it faces towards the right side of the image, much like the original profile in Image A. Its trunk and head are directed towards the right, confirming the profile orientation is preserved.",
    "answer": "Yes"
