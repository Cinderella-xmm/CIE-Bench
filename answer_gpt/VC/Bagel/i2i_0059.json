      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a mechanical object resembling an elephant, and no food items are present. The original appearance of any steak is completely replaced by a fictional mechanical design. This indicates that the charred and cooked appearance of the steak from Image A is not retained in Image B, as there is no steak present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses on a steampunk-style machine, with no visible broccoli florets or any food items. Therefore, there is no retention of bright green broccoli florets with their natural shape from Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no food items visible, including carrot slices. The scene is entirely different, focusing on a mechanical elephant object. Thus, no bright orange carrot slices with circular shapes are present in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a mechanical construct with no presence or arrangement of steak or vegetables. The layout and theme of Image B are entirely different from the meal setting shown in Image A, resulting in no similar positioning.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a mechanical elephant in what appears to be a forest environment, which is vastly different from the meal setting on a tablecloth seen in Image A. The colorful striped tablecloth is not present in Image B.",
