        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the sky features characteristics that correspond to swirling patterns, which suggest movement and dynamic flow. These features are indicative of the vortex texture characteristic of the original artwork style. Based on this observation and world knowledge of the original artwork, the edited image definitely retains the swirling vortex texture.",

      "question": "Is the prominent cypress tree on the left side of the image still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a tall, dark-shaped form resembling a cypress tree is visible on the left side. This matches the common feature found in 'Starry Night,' where a cypress tree prominently occupies this position, contributing to the iconic composition of the painting. Therefore, the prominent cypress tree in Image B is still present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, you can discern buildings resembling a village, with a tall, thin spire rising among them. This configuration aligns with the original scene's depiction of a village with a church steeple as a focal point. Given these observations, the village with the church steeple remains in the center of Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B shows undulating forms that fit the description of rolling hills typically found in depictions similar to 'Starry Night.' These forms are distinguishable by their curved contours and elevated positioning behind other elements of the image, affirming their presence in the edited version.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B predominantly shows vibrant blues and yellows, consistent with the hallmark colors of the original 'Starry Night.' Moreover, the texture appears thick and bold, with visible, dynamic brushstrokes that convey movement and textureâ€”a notable feature of the style used by Van Gogh in the original. Thus, Image B retains the original color palette and brushstroke texture.",
