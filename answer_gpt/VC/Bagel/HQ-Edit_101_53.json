      "question": "Are the characteristic forehead wrinkles of the pug present and accurately represented in the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the sculpture clearly shows pronounced lines on the forehead characteristic of a pug's wrinkles. These lines are carved into the wood, replicating the distinct wrinkles in a stylized manner. This is consistent with the characteristic look of a pug, known for its prominent forehead wrinkles. Therefore, the sculpture does represent these wrinkles accurately.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the black muzzle and surrounding facial marking (including under the eyes and around the nose) preserved in the same location and shape as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the wood carving of the pug does not include color, so the muzzle and facial marking around the nose and under the eyes are represented only through carved patterns. The location and shape mimic the original shapes but do not convey the color contrast as in Image A, where the dark muzzle is more prominent.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the large, round, dark eyes with clearly defined pupils preserved in the same position and shape as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the sculpture portrays the pug's eyes as large, round, and prominent with clearly defined pupils, similar to the original image. The position and shape of the eyes in the sculpture closely mirror the pug's characteristic expression, maintaining the same look as in Image A.",
      "weight": 3,

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the floppy black ears positioned symmetrically on top of the head and shaped as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the wooden sculpture represents the ears in a symmetrical position on top of the head. However, the ears are not colored black like in Image A, due to the nature of the wooden medium. The shape and positioning are consistent with the original, though the color is not preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the pug depicted in an upright sitting position with both front paws placed forward, matching the original stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both the original image and the sculpture depict the pug in an upright sitting position with its front paws placed forward. This upright sitting position is a typical resting position for pugs and is consistently represented in both images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the fawn-colored body area preserved in the same region as the original, contrasting with the black facial mask?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the sculpture uses carved lines rather than color to represent the pug's features. The fawn color of the body seen in the original image is represented solely by the wood's natural color, but there is no color contrast with the facial mask, which is not black.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the head-to-body proportion consistent with the original pug, maintaining a broad head relative to the compact body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden sculpture accurately maintains the pug's typical head-to-body proportion, with a broad head relative to the compact body. This proportion is a defining feature of pugs and is well captured in the sculpture, as seen in the original image.",
