      "question": "Is the McLaren logo clearly visible on the center of the car's hood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the model car's hood does not display any visible logo or emblem typically found on real cars or miniature models. The absence of any clear logo or branding on the hood suggests that it likely does not feature the McLaren logo, as would be common with branded models. Therefore, combined with the visual evidence provided, the conclusion is based on the absence of any identifiable emblem.",

      "question": "Are the headlights shaped in a narrow, curved, and horizontally elongated design with internal LED strips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the headlights of the miniature model car appear to be curved and horizontally elongated, which adheres to modern sports car designs. However, the internal design detail such as LED strips is not clearly observable in this miniature context. Given the visual cues, the image does suggest a similar general shape, yet lacks visibility of more intricate interior features such as LED strips due to scale.",

      "question": "Are the brake calipers behind the front wheels colored bright orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brake calipers on the miniature model are not visibly distinct or highlighted in bright orange. Instead, the miniature's smaller scale means that specific elements like brake calipers are not portrayed with distinct colors or details typically seen in real cars. The analysis concludes based on the observed absence of this coloring detail.",

      "question": "Do the tree leaves display a vibrant, natural green color without significant discoloration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees included in the diorama exhibit a green hue that appears both vibrant and natural. The artificial setting allows for a consistent coloration of the leaves which maintains a vivid green without signs of discoloration. This observation aligns with typical appearances in model settings designed to mimic real life.",

      "question": "Are white lane markings present on the asphalt road beneath the car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a diorama with no visible asphalt road under the car; rather, the setting is a miniature display case. The surface where the car rests does not include road markings. Therefore, based on observed visual cues, there are no road-based elements such as lane markings in Image B.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the car have a raised, sharply angled edge along the side above the wheel arches indicating dihedral door hinges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which portrays the model car prominently, the sides above the wheel arches do not display a sharply angled edge typical of dihedral door hinges. The miniature representation lacks the subtle features often found in full-sized cars reflecting advanced hinge mechanisms. Therefore, based on the visible details, the model does not include these design specifics.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there at least two other cars visible in the background â€” one red and one yellow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a diorama focused on the single model car within a display case environment, without a visual background that includes other colored cars. The constrained setting of Image B does not extend beyond its own small, dedicated scene that includes no additional vehicles. Consequently, based on these observations, other cars are not present in the image.",
