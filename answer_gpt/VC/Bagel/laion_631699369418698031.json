    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the two upward-curving horn-like protrusions still present on either side of the top face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the totem is placed under a glass dome, and several elements such as greenery and a butterfly are added. Observing the top face of the totem, the horn-like protrusions present on either side in Image A seem to be absent in Image B. This suggests a modification in the depiction of the totem beyond just environmental elements.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure of the totem appears more simplified than in Image A, particularly at the top section. The rectangular frame with horizontal grooves directly beneath the top face does not appear to be present in Image B, suggesting a change in structural design.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the diamond-patterned border around the lower edge of the totem is visible, ensuring consistency in design elements compared to Image A. The detail adds to the ornate features of the totem and remains unaltered.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B preserves the natural wood grain texture observed in Image A, maintaining the realism and artistic integrity of the totem's surface. This detail is crucial in retaining the authentic appearance of the wooden sculpture.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The three faces in Image B are consistent with those in Image A, featuring closed eyes and open mouths with visible teeth. This design element is a defining characteristic of the totem's faces and is retained in the edited version.",

      "question": "Is the bottom face larger than the middle face, which is larger than the top face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The relative sizes of the faces in Image B are consistent with those in Image A, where the bottom face is the largest, followed by the middle face, and the top face is the smallest. This hierarchical size structure is a typical design aspect of totem pole-style sculptures.",
