    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the recognizable coastline shape of North and South America, including the Gulf of Mexico and the narrow isthmus of Central America?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, there is a dominant ship’s wheel, and there are silhouette figures and a large scroll map, but no visible depiction of the coastlines of North and South America is present as seen in Image A. The focus has shifted entirely to illustrative elements rather than geographical features.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the latitude and longitude grid lines still visible or clearly implied in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the primary elements are decorative and thematic, including a large central ship wheel and silhouettes, but the detailed geographical elements such as latitude and longitude lines are not visible or implied as they were in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the aged parchment texture, including stains and discoloration, preserved in the background of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, features thematic elements such as scrolls, a ship’s wheel, and decorative silhouettes. The background is colorful and lacks the aged parchment texture with stains and discoloration that was present in Image A. This indicates a clear shift in artistic styling.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the original sepia, gold, and green tones preserved as the dominant color palette in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a distinct shift to a brighter and more varied color palette, particularly with the dominant golds and other hues introduced with the ship’s wheel and decorative elements, as opposed to preserving the original sepia, gold, and green tones seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image presented in Image B does not feature the detailed cartographic elements from Image A, such as handwritten script labels or ship illustrations. The focus is on thematic decorative elements without retaining these precise historical details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the transformed compass (now a ship’s wheel) retain the golden metallic finish and intricate engraved patterns seen in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the compass is transformed into a ship’s wheel, it does retain a similar golden metallic finish and keeps the intricate engraved pattern aesthetic, harmonizing with the nautical theme presented throughout the image. This transformation still nods to the decorative complexity of the original object.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the focus is no longer on the map orientation or traditional map elements. The central image is heavily thematic and symbolic, with no clear geographical orientation present, unlike the conventional map in Image A with such orientation cues.",
