    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the conical, tiered structure composed of multiple horizontal levels stacked vertically preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure is a two-dimensional cut-out shaped like a Christmas tree or conifer. It is not a three-dimensional conical structure or tiered design as traditionally seen in dessert designs. The visual appearance of Image B lacks any horizontally stacked tier elements, indicating that the conical, tiered structure present in the original is not preserved.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the teardrop-shaped chocolate droplets positioned at the center of each tier preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design is a flat tree-shaped cut-out featuring round, nut-like embellishments at various points. There are no teardrop-shaped chocolate droplets at the center of horizontal tiers because the entire structural form of tiers is absent.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the chocolate pinecone-like structures supporting each tier preserved in their original form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict any supporting structures akin to chocolate pinecones. The visual composition is that of a flat chocolate cut-out with nut decorations, rather than a three-dimensional tiered structure relying on pinecone-like supports.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the nuts (including almonds, pecans, and hazelnuts) visibly contained within the teardrop-shaped droplets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, nuts are present as decorative elements on the chocolate creation; however, they are not contained within teardrop-shaped droplets as the original structure described. This indicates a different arrangement and presentation, with nuts set on the surface rather than enclosed droplets.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wide, circular base with a horizontal band at its edge preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The structure in Image B does not feature a wide, circular base with a horizontal band. The base is part of a flat, triangular tree-shaped design, distinct from any circular base that might be present in a tiered structure.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the overall color scheme dominated by deep brown tones with gold highlights preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design still mainly features deep brown chocolate, consistent with a rich chocolate appearance, and the presence of golden nuts could give a subtle gold highlight. Thus, while the intricate golden details may differ, the overall deep brown aesthetic with gold elements is retained.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the teardrop-shaped droplets centrally aligned along the vertical axis of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include vertically aligned teardrop-shaped droplets since it is a flat cut-out with a singular shape and does not have the vertical complexity or elements along a central axis as would be expected in a multi-layered chocolate confection.",
