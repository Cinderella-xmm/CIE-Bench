      "question": "Does the edited image retain the alternating tan and dark brown pattern on the turtle's shell?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image depicts a stylized cartoon-like character with mostly a uniform color on the shell, lacking the distinct alternating tan and dark brown pattern visible in Image A. The shell in Image A has a natural look with alternating shades, which is typical for a tortoise, while Image B's character design opts for a more simplified color scheme reflecting stylization. This shows a clear departure from the original pattern.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the turtle's limb structure, even if the limbs are stylized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a stylized character with limbs that resemble the general shape of the tortoise's limbs in Image A. While the limbs are simplified and cartoonish, they maintain the overall structure, such as the presence of joints and digits, which are key elements of the tortoise's limb anatomy.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the textured appearance of the turtle's shell?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B simplifies the shell into a smooth, cartoonish form devoid of the detailed textures seen in Image A. The original image shows a textured shell with clear ridges and grooves typical of real tortoises. The edited image's shell lacks these textures and is instead depicted as a smooth, patterned surface in line with a stylistic art approach.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the turtle's head structure, including its visible eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head structure of the stylized character maintains characteristics seen in Image A, such as a distinctive head shape and visible eyes. While the design is more exaggerated and animated to fit a certain artistic style, the essential elements like the positioning and size of the eyes, as well as the overall head shape, reflect those of a tortoise.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features smooth, art-stylized limbs without retaining the nuanced texturing found in Image A. The original image demonstrates textured, rugged limbs typical of tortoises, but the edited character design opts for smooth and simplified surfaces, emphasizing a cartoon style over realistic texture.",
