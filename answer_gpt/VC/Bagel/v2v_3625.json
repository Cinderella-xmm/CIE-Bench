      "question": "Does the edited image retain the representation of a navigational tool (map)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface appears to be covered in a mosaic-like pattern with segmented areas that do not resemble a traditional navigational map. Navigational tools usually consist of recognizable geographic features, such as roads and landscape details, which are absent in Image B. The stark contrast with regular map appearances, combined with common knowledge of maps' characteristics, suggests that Image B does not depict a conventional map.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there identifiable markers (pins) indicating specific locations/routes on the map?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes four colored pins (blue, yellow, red, green) that stand upright in a similar position as seen in maps for denoting locations or routes. The presence of these pins implies specific marking, which is common in map usage for location identification. Therefore, despite the mosaic pattern, the pins suggest there are identifiable markers.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a visible hand interacting with the map, specifically placing a marker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a hand is visibly interacting with the surface and appears to be placing a red pin onto the map-like area. This is consistent with actions typically associated with maps, providing visual evidence of human interaction with the scene. Hence, the edited image includes the hand placing a marker.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the markers (pins) visibly connected, suggesting a planned route?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pins are connected by lines, presumably drawn or laid out on the surface resembling planned paths or routes, which is typical in map setups to suggest travel or connection between points. The pattern, thus, conveys the impression of a route being outlined.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the wooden surface and the beige sweater sleeve as part of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B visibly retains the sleeve of a beige sweater, akin to Image A. The setting in Image B continues to include elements suggestive of a wooden table, supporting the presence of these components in the scene. These details were not altered in the editing process.",
