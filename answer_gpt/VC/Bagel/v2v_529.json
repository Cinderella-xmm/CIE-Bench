      "question": "** Is the subject depicted in a horizontal plank pose, supported by hands and toes?\n**",
      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is a LEGO minifigure encapsulated in a display case, standing upright next to a small LEGO dog. The upright position and the nature of LEGO figures, with their limited articulation, make it impossible for the subject to be depicted in a horizontal plank pose supported by hands and toes.",

      "question": "** Is the subject wearing a sleeveless tank top and shorts?\n**",
      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a LEGO minifigure that is dressed in a sleeveless top akin to a tank top, and the figure appears to wear pants rather than shorts. The specific clothing style matches the characteristics typically seen on tank tops and pants for LEGO figures.",

      "question": "** Does the background maintain a clean and minimalistic aesthetic?\n**",
      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is blurred but appears to be a simple, unadorned surface, focusing attention on the display case containing the LEGO figure. The minimal decoration and plain surface contribute to a clean and minimalistic aesthetic.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "LEGO minifigures such as the one in Image B do not have detailed muscular anatomy like a human figure. Their simplified block-like design lacks any visible muscle definition, so it cannot indicate physical strength.",

      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO minifigure in Image B has a fixed facial expression and head position, typical of LEGO toys, without noticeable variation indicating an upward gaze. Its gaze is straightforward, with a standard LEGO smile, not specifically conveying focus or determination.",
