    "Question": "Q3: Is the guitar oriented vertically with the neck pointing upward?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object shown is not a guitar but a dragon. The orientation of the dragon's body is vertical, but since it is not a guitar, the question of neck orientation becomes irrelevant as there is no guitar neck to assess. Thus, the correct answer is 'No'.",
