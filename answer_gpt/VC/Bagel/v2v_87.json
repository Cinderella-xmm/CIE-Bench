      "question": "Does the elephant in the edited image retain large, fan-shaped ears that extend outward from the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is depicted with large, fan-shaped ears that extend outward, resembling the typical characteristics of an African elephant. This is evident from the image's clear portrayal of the ears, which, despite being a LEGO representation, capture the typical features associated with African elephants.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the elephant’s tusks long, curved, and off-white in color, extending downward from the upper jaw?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's tusks are represented as long, curved, and off-white, which is typical for an African elephant. The visual represents these tusks as extending downward, capturing the characteristic appearance of tusks in elephants.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the elephant’s skin depicted with deep wrinkles and folds, particularly on the trunk, legs, and ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO representation of the elephant shows an effort to mimic the deep wrinkles and folds associated with elephants, especially around the trunk and legs. While the material of the toy does not allow for detailed skin texture, the suggestion of these features is evident.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the elephant’s feet show five distinct toes on each foot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, as it is a LEGO representation, the elephant's feet are simplified and do not depict the anatomical detail of distinct toes. As such, it does not show five distinct toes, which is typical of such abstract representations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no backpack present. The focus is on the LEGO elephant and figure within a display case, and thus, there is no replication of the rich, saturated red color backpack from the original image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question": "Is the backpack present as a separate object positioned near the elephant in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no backpack present. The edited image focuses on the LEGO display of an elephant and a figurine. The backpack from Image A does not appear in Image B at all.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the animal clearly identifiable as an African elephant based on its ear size, tusk shape, and overall body structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO model features large ears extending outward, long curved tusks, and a robust body structure, all characteristic of an African elephant. Despite being a simplified toy model, it retains identifiable features that suggest it is modeled after an African elephant.",
