    "Question": "Q1: Is the curved side profile of the grand piano preserved, maintaining its characteristic gentle arc and elongated form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object that is meant to represent a piano has an altered structure. It is styled as a makeup palette rather than a grand piano, with a flat section where keys should be. The gentle arc and elongated form characteristic of a grand piano are not maintained. In Image A, the grand piano indeed has its characteristic curvature and arc, which is typical of its design. Therefore, the editing altered this feature in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the four tapered legs with decorative casters present and positioned beneath the piano body as in the original?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the object intended to mimic a piano but with modifications. The legs in Image B are different, with one of them acting as a cover for a makeup item. In Image A, the legs are elegantly tapered with casters, showing a classic piano design. The comparison reveals that the edited version in Image B does not retain the original grand piano leg design.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the piano positioned directly in the center of the corridor, aligned with the vanishing point created by the columns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the piano object is placed in a room without a visible corridor with columns that lead to a vanishing point. It is positioned in front of a background that does not have the same leading elements as Image A. In Image A, the grand piano is precisely aligned within a corridor framed by columns, creating a center-focused perspective. The edited image does not maintain this alignment.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the floor composed of large square tiles arranged in a repeating pattern of alternating dark and light shades?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the floor is covered in a consistent bright marble-like pattern without the alternating tile pattern described. On the other hand, Image A's floor has a uniform pattern without the alternating shades, as both are single-colored. This indicates that the edited image does not adopt an alternating dark and light tile pattern.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there tall, evenly spaced white columns extending along both sides of the corridor, forming a symmetrical passage?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a background with marble walls rather than a corridor framed by columns. This contrasts with Image A, where there are tall white columns. The absence of such columns in Image B signifies that this characteristic is not retained.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the piano retain a highly reflective, glossy black surface that mirrors the surrounding environment?",
    "explanation": "Image B features an object that mimics a piano, which is matte in appearance and serves as a makeup display. In contrast, Image A shows a highly reflective, glossy surface typical of classical grand pianos. Thus, the reflective characteristic is not preserved in the edited image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are soft shadows cast beneath the piano and along the floor, consistent with overhead lighting from above?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible subtle shadows around the object. Image A displays soft shadows cast from the piano onto the floor, indicative of upper lighting. Comparison highlights that the shadow details from Image A are absent in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
