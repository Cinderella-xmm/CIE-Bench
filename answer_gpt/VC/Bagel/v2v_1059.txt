    "Question": "Q1: Are the zebras' bodies covered in distinct black and white stripes that follow the natural pattern seen in the original image, including variations in thickness and alignment across the torso, legs, and face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras are stylized figures that appear more cartoonish with exaggerated features and smoother lines. Their stripes are more uniform and less varied compared to a real zebra’s pattern. The stripes in Image B do not mimic the natural thickness variations and alignments seen on actual zebras, as depicted in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is each zebra depicted with its head lowered toward the ground in a natural grazing pose, with legs positioned to support this stance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras are shown with heads lowered towards the ground, resembling a grazing pose. This matches the stance seen in Image A where the zebras are naturally grazing with appropriate leg support. Despite the cartoonish style, the pose is indicative of grazing.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the horizontal wire fence with evenly spaced wooden posts clearly visible across the mid-ground of the image, separating the field from the treeline?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a stylized wooden fence in the background, replacing the wire fence in Image A. The fence in Image B consists of railings and wooden posts, but it does not match the wire fence composition from the original image. The style and materials look different, and the design is more decorative.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the ground covered in green grass with visible patches of bare soil and small green shrubs scattered throughout the field?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ground is covered in uniform green grass typical of a stylized cartoon scene. There are not any visible patches of bare soil, and while there are some small elements resembling shrubs, they are fewer and less natural in appearance than what Image A depicts.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a continuous line of green trees and bushes behind the fence, with a clear light blue sky above the horizon?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a background featuring green trees that resemble a continuous line behind the fence, and the sky is visible and appears blue. This is consistent with the setting seen in Image A, although Image B's representation is more stylized.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the zebras have short, upright manes composed of alternating black and white stripes, consistent with their body patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras have manes that are upright and appear in an alternating color pattern; however, as the entire scene is stylized, the resemblance to real zebra mane patterns from Image A is not perfectly accurate. The mane is a simplified and exaggerated version.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the zebra’s hooves dark in color and positioned on the ground in a way that supports their grazing posture?",
    "explanation": "The zebras in Image B have hooves that are colored to look dark, consistent with real-life zebra hooves. They are positioned in a way that supports the pose of the zebras in a natural grazing posture, similar to that seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
