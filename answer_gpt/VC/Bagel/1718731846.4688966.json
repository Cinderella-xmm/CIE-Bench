      "question": "Is the vertical facial split between black and white fur still present, dividing the face precisely down the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a wooden sculpture of a dog with a clearly defined facial split between black and a lighter natural wood color that runs vertically down the center. This represents the characteristic feature of a precisely divided face, similar to the original image A, which also has a clear split between black and white fur. Thus, the vertical facial split remains present and divides the face down the center in both images.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both eyes large, round, and positioned symmetrically on either side of the facial split, with visible highlights reflecting light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes are shown as rounded and symmetrically positioned on either side of the facial split. However, the wood does not create highlights reflecting light like the glossy eyes in Image A, which depict large, round eyes with visible reflections. The edited image B does lack visible reflections due to the material contrast.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the dog in an upright sitting position with both front paws flat on the ground and hind legs tucked beneath the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the dog as a wooden sculpture, maintaining an upright sitting posture. Its front paws resemble positioning as if flat on a surface and hind legs portrayed back, which is common in such poses. Image A also shows the dog in an upright sitting position, confirming both share this posture characteristic.",

      "question": "Are both ears pointed upward, erect, and symmetrical, with visible pink inner surfaces and dark outer edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both ears are symmetrical and pointed upwards. However, the inner surfaces are not pink but instead share the same wood color. In Image A, the ears feature a pink inner surface with dark outer edges. Therefore, the edited image lacks the pink inner ear depiction.",

      "question": "Is the black nose centered on the white muzzle, with visible whisker lines extending from the sides of the snout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black nose is centered on the lighter wood muzzle without visible whisker lines extending from the snout, unlike Image A, which shows a black nose on a white muzzle with whisker lines. The sculpture does not include these finer details present in the original.",

      "question": "Is there a collar visible around the dogâ€™s neck with at least one tag hanging from it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a circular element at the neck area resembling a tag but lacks a visible collar emphasized as in Image A, where a metallic tag hangs from a defined collar. The wooden sculpture features simplified design elements, which do not distinctly show these accessories.",
