      "question": "Is the central arched doorway with a cross above it present in the same position on the church facade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which depicts a miniature model, there is a central arched doorway on the facade of the structure with a cross above it, suggesting a similar architectural design as a church. In Image A, the church features a prominent central doorway with a cross above it as well. Thus, visually, this element is preserved in both images.",

      "question": "Is the round window located directly above the central doorway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the model has a rectangular window located above the central doorway. However, in Image A, there is a round window directly above the central doorway of the church. This distinction in architectural details leads to the conclusion that the placement of the round window differs between Image B and Image A.",

      "question": "Is the bell tower with a dome and spire visible above the church roof?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure features a dome and spire on its bell tower, which is consistent with ornamental styles typical of such models. In Image A, the church indeed has a bell tower with a dome and spire visible above the roof, indicating that both share this architectural element.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are white umbrellas positioned over tables to the left of the church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, being a model, depicts a miniature setting with tables, chairs, and figures, but lacks umbrellas. In contrast, Image A shows real-life umbrellas over tables located to the left of the church. This indicates that the feature is absent in the model version (Image B).",

      "question": "Is a tree located near the café on the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the model adds decorative trees beside the structure but does not indicate an actual café or its specific positioning as seen in Image A, where there is a tree near the café area. Thus, the presence and specific positioning relative to a café are not directly mirrored in the model.",
      "weight": 2,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the model does not feature curved stone steps leading to the entrance. In Image A, there is a set of curved steps leading up to the church entrance visible on the right side. Therefore, this architectural feature is not replicated on the model.",
      "weight": 2,

    {

      "question": "Is a building with blue-and-white tiled walls and black metal balconies visible to the left of the church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include surrounding buildings in its miniature representation. In Image A, there is a building with distinctive blue-and-white tiled walls and balconies to the left side of the church. This element is absent in Image B, which aims to focus only on the church structure.",
      "weight": 2,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the model includes a decorative element resembling a small cross at the top of its dome. Image A includes similar crosses on small spire elements of the church. Hence, both images include this feature, albeit on different architectural details.",

      "question": "Is the roof of the church covered in red tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the model roof does not display red tiles; it is uniformly colored and styled. Conversely, Image A's church has a roof partially visible with red tiles. This difference in roofing detail indicates the answer to be negative for Image B.",
