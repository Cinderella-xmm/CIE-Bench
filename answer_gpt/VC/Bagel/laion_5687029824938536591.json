      "question": "Is the triangular panel structure across the midfoot preserved in shape and spatial arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited shoe design features a wooden appearance, and the triangular panel structure is creatively represented through wooden pieces designed to mimic the original shape and spatial arrangement. The panels span across the midfoot in a similar manner to Image A, although the material transformation gives them a distinctly different craftsmanship-like style. The reasoning involves recognizing the consistency of triangular patterns transitioning from a fabric and synthetic design in the original to a sculptural wood design in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the \"SPEEDCROSS\" text positioned along the lateral side of the shoe in the same location and orientation as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'SPEEDCROSS' appears absent from the lateral side of the shoe. Instead, the shoe exhibits a carved wooden design with no textual elements visible from this view. Recognizing that Image A clearly showcases the 'SPEEDCROSS' text on the upper side, particularly where colored letters are integrated into the panel lines, indicates a definitive design change in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the Salomon logos present on both the heel counter and tongue tab in their original positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B reveals that no logos, including 'Salomon,' are visible on the footwear where they are present in Image A. Image A clearly features the 'Salomon' logo on the heel section and 'S' logo on the tongue, which are not represented in any form in the edited image. The design transformation into textured wood excludes these logos entirely, supporting the conclusion that they're absent.",

      "question": "Is the lacing system maintained with the same number and spacing of eyelets as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a lacing system that mimics traditional shoelaces, but Detailed inspection suggests differences in the number and spacing of the eyelets compared to Image A. While Image A employs a synthetic speed lacing system with distinct eyelet shapes and spacing, Image B presents a more standard aesthetic with fewer contrasting elements related to eyelet architecture. The simplification here deviates from the original structural complexity.",

      "question": "Is the outsole lug pattern and the \"contagrip\" text preserved in their original positions and shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a stylized wooden shoe design, where the outsole lug pattern does not match the irregular, gear-like pattern seen in Image A. Image A features aggressive lug positioning and 'contagrip' text on the sole area, but these elements undergo significant transformation in the edited image to accommodate a smooth, wooden texture without visible text, suggesting a departure from the original.",

      "question": "Is the reinforced toe cap shape and the embossed \"S\" logo preserved in the same location and form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the reinforced toe cap does showcase a design resembling its counterpart in Image A, depicted as sculpted wooden layers reinforcing the structural integrity. However, the 'S' logo is not visible embossed on the toe cap in Image B, whereas Image A clearly includes that branding. This observation underscores the absence of the original branding within the edited image's artistic interpretation of the toe area.",

      "question": "Is the \"LT LIGHT WEIGHT MIDSOLE\" label present in the same location and shape near the heel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks any textual labels, including 'LT LIGHT WEIGHT MIDSOLE,' despite the area resembling the heel's original location in Image A. The design rendition does not incorporate explicit branding or labels in the wooden aesthetic transition. Observing Image A, wherein the label is positioned, leads to understanding that its deliberate omission is a stylistic choice for the edited design.",
