      "question": "Is the white base of the face paint present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues don't include clear indications of any white base face paint, focusing instead on other visual elements like the flowers, braids, and earrings. With no specific visual indicators of face paint, the answer is based on its absence in the visible portion of the image.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visibility is focused on the headdress and the earrings, but it lacks specific details indicating red floral designs around the eyes. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that such designs are not part of the visible details.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while elements like flowers and braided hair are clear, there is no visible blue spiderweb with golden dots. The absence of these visual cues implies they are not present.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image clearly showcases black, orange, and yellow braids in the hair, which are visually distinct and thus confirm their presence in the headdress of Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The earrings in Image B have a spherical design rather than a filigree pattern as seen in Image A. Analyzing the visual elements indicates a switch from the filigree to a spherical style.",
