      "question": "Is the golden-brown color present on the plush chicken wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, plush items resembling chicken wings are seen, which have a mustard-like yellow color instead of a golden-brown hue. This observation is based on the clear differentiation of color visible in the image.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the plush chicken wings shaped like real chicken wings, including distinct drumettes and flats?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush objects do not display the distinct anatomical features of drumettes and flats seen in real chicken wings. They have a more abstract rounded shape without segments that distinguish drumettes and flats, which are typical in actual chicken wings.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a small white bowl located at the bottom right corner of the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include a plate or a white bowl in the bottom right corner. It shows plush items on a wooden surface without distinct tableware typically used for food presentation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the object inside the small white bowl bright orange in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a bowl or an object inside it, let alone one of bright orange color. The image only displays plush figurines and an orange pillow. Hence, there is nothing to describe as bright orange within a bowl.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there approximately ten plush chicken wings on the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays two plush objects shaped like abstract versions of chicken wings on a surface, rather than a plate with multiple items. Hence, there are only two objects instead of ten.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's no plate or white bowl depicted in any position, including the bottom right. The image only features two plush objects and an orange pillow with no identifiable serving items or placements.",
