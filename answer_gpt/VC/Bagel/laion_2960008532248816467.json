    {

      "question": "Is the stylized \"P\" logo with a cart-like shape and circular wheel present on the surface of both tarts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual elements emphasize a cartoon-style cake with facial features and surrounded by animated animals. The image does not contain any logo resembling a stylized 'P' with a cart-like shape or circular wheel on the cake. The focus is instead on the personified cake itself within a fantastical setting, which suggests the creative domain rather than business branding found in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the word \"PABLO\" written in uppercase letters beneath the logo on both tarts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, it becomes clear that it is a cartoonish depiction featuring a happy face on the cake, accompanied by whimsical characters and surroundings. There is no presence of any brand name, such as 'PABLO', within this fantastical illustration. Image A features the branding, indicating that Image B is more focused on a narrative element rather than identifying marks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the top surface of each tart display a bright yellow layer covering most of the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake is depicted with a bright yellow top surface, consistent with the vibrant and colorful style typical of playful illustrations, yet it is only visible on the cake in the image, without indicating a second 'tart'. The image suggests a singular focus on this playful cake, whereas Image A shows two pastries each covered with similar topping as described.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible white creamy filling beneath the yellow top layer in both tarts, especially in the sliced portion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a cake with a visible smiley face, focusing on the playful aesthetic and fantasy elements. No sliced portion or creamy filling is visible as the depiction does not involve a realistic portrayal with internal visual indicators. Image A reveals the real pastries with a detailed cross-section visible, but Image B diverts from realism to storybook aesthetics, negating the reference to any filling.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the crust of both tarts exhibit a golden-brown color with a flaky, uneven edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake has a vibrant and flattering design as seen through cartoon rendering, with a simplified crust devoid of distinct textural features that might depict flakiness or unevenness. The crust is consistently angled and borders the cheerful face, aligning the attributes with simplicity and charm rather than realistic baking properties seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the rear tart partially sliced to reveal the internal cross-section of the filling and crust?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a whimsical intact cake with expressive features and characters surrounding it. No indication of slicing or internal segments is visible, as the narrative intention emphasizes an imaginative world scene without diverting to culinary presentation. Image A shows an actual pastry sliced to display the internal sections, demonstrating the use of cross-section presentation that Image B lacks.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the whole tart positioned in front of the partially sliced tart, with the latter slightly elevated and angled toward the back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a single cake is depicted centrally within a fairytale-like forest scene, focusing on vibrancy and illustration style rather than physical arrangement or relative positions. The image implies no placement hierarchy found in a culinary context as seen in Image A, where two tarts are strategically arranged for visual comparison.",
