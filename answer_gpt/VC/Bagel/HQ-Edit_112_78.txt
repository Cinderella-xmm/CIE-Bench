    "Question": "Q1: Is the central floral medallion located on the front center of the body, surrounded by symmetrical scrollwork?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the item is a candle encased in a glass holder rather than a teapot. Therefore, there is no central floral medallion surrounded by symmetrical scrollwork on the front center of the candle holder. This description suits the teapot in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the spout extend from the left side of the body with a curled, scroll-like tip?",
    "explanation": "The candle holder in Image B does not have a spout, as it is not a teapot but an elegant glass container holding a candle. The described feature pertains to the teapot in the original image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the handle on the right side of the body shaped like a C with ornate volute ends?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a candle holder without handles. The characteristic of having a C-shaped handle with ornate volute ends is specific to the teapot in Image A and is not applicable here.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a small decorative finial atop the lid?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a small decorative finial atop the lid of the candle holder. This detail is clear and resembles the description provided. The teapot in Image A also has a finial, but here the focus is on Image B, which clearly matches the description.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there four ornate feet supporting the base of the object?",
    "explanation": "The candle holder in Image B is placed directly on the marble slab without ornate feet. This aspect of ornate feet matches the teapot from Image A, not the candle holder in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the floral and foliate patterns arranged symmetrically around the body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the candle holder has etched patterns on its glass surface, which gives it an ornate appearance, but these are not floral and foliate patterns arranged symmetrically around the body. Instead, it has geometric patterns. The description applies to the teapot in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the object retain the same overall rounded silhouette with a domed lid and balanced spout and handle?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a candle holder which has a rounded silhouette with a domed lid but lacks a spout and handle. These features are relevant to the teapot from Image A, hence this does not apply to Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
