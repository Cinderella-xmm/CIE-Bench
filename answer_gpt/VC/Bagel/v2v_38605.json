      "question": "Does the edited image retain the dynamic posture of the subject, showing a forward-leaning stance with bent knees?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is depicted surfing, showing a forward-leaning stance with bent knees to maintain balance, which is typical in surfing to react to waves. This is similar to the skiing posture in Image A, where a forward-leaning and bent knees position is necessary for maneuvering on snow slopes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hands are positioned in a manner typically used for balance during surfing, with the arms extended away from the body. This posture is consistent with surfing activities, where the hands are used to help stabilize the surfer on the board.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the skier's attire in some form, such as a wetsuit or beach-appropriate clothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject retains a similar jacket as seen in Image A, despite the different context of surfing rather than skiing. The jacket is bright and eye-catching, which can sometimes be worn in casual beach settings for warmth or fashion, but not a wetsuit as would be common for surfing.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is not wearing any protective gear like a helmet or goggles that would be expected for surfing activities. This contrasts with Image A where the subject wears necessary protective gear for skiing, such as a helmet.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is characterized by bright and vivid colors typical of a tropical beach setting, including the bright blue sky, green palm trees, and yellow surfboard. This color scheme is appropriate for beach imagery, contrasting with the more muted, wintry landscape in Image A.",
