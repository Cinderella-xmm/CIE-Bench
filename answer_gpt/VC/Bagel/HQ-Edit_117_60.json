      "question": "Are both the main triangular sail and the smaller jib sail present and correctly positioned on the mast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sailboat sculpture features two distinctly positioned triangular sails, with one larger and the other smaller, indicating the presence of the main sail and jib sail. The presence of these sails is typical for many sailboats, where the main sail is generally larger and the jib sail is smaller. Their placement in a typical sail configuration adds to the realism of the sculpture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a single vertical mast located centrally along the length of the boat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture has a singular vertical mast that is centrally placed along the length of the boat. This design is common for many sailboats as it provides necessary support for the sails and stability for the vessel.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the boat have a sharply pointed bow extending forward from the hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B has a rounded bow rather than a sharply pointed one. A pointed bow is characteristic of many boats for cutting through water efficiently, while a rounded bow is often seen in artistic or decorative representations.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a covered section with open sides and vertical railings located over the midsection of the hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, the sculpture does not show any covered sections or open sides with vertical railings over the midsection of the hull. It features only the wood carving representing the hull and sails, which focuses on a simplified artistic design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no indication of a small red flag at the stern. The sculpture is focused on the artistic representation of the sails and hull without additional details that would imply such decoration.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the sails, mast, deck, and bow aligned in their original spatial configuration, maintaining the correct proportions and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B maintains a traditional arrangement of the main elements such as the sails, mast, and hull, preserving the proportions and orientation typically expected in a sailboat. Although it simplifies details for artistic purposes, the spatial configuration is consistent with the depiction of a sailboat.",
