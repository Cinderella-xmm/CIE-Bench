    "Question": "Q1: Is the number '7' clearly visible on both the front fender and side panel of the motorcycle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the graphic design is abstract and does not depict actual physical motorcycle details like numbers on fenders and panels. Instead, it focuses on stylized representations, such as colorful streaks and silhouettes, indicating speed and motion. World knowledge about motorcycle design tells us these details are usually found on actual motorcycles, but Image B's artistic style does not include such specifics. Therefore, the answer is based on the content of Image B, where no numbers are visible.",
