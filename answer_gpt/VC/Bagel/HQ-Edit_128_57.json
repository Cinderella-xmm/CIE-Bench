      "question": "Is the lion’s head medallion present at the center of the desk's front panel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a central decorative emblem on the box which resembles a medallion. It shows a crest-like motif with intricate design similar to a lion's head which typically appears in such settings. Using common knowledge, the emblem's location in the center of the box makes it comparable to the central placement on a desk front panel. Visual cues indicate that the distinctive emblem has been retained in a different context as a part of a box design, thus the lion’s head is present.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the quill maintain its feather shape, even if stylized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a quill in the box which retains a recognizable feather-like shape, portraying a traditional writing quill even when stylized or depicted in an ornamental context. The visual presentation suggests this is a stylized but clear representation of a quill, maintaining the expected feather outline.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the book depicted as open, showing two pages of aged, yellowed paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book is presented in a closed format rather than an open one. It shows a sleek cover with embossed patterns instead of pages. This indicates the image does not display any open aged, yellowed pages. Therefore, no such depiction of an open book with visible pages is made.",

      "question": "Does the desk retain its dark wood texture and finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has replaced the desk with a wooden box containing objects. The box's texture and finish are dark and wood-like, resembling the original desk's rich texture. The intrinsic material appearance, such as grain and coloration, suggests a similar character but in a different item's frame. Thus, the dark wood-like texture is preserved effectively.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the arched window with a grid of leaded glass panes visible behind the desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B doesn't present any window as part of the box composition. It is more focused on the box design and contents, which does not include any background window features at all. Therefore, no arched window is visible in Image B.",

      "question": "Are tall bookshelves with rows of leather-bound books visible to the left of the desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no bookshelves present as this image aims at presenting a boxed set. The focus is clearly on the arrangement of items within the box without incorporating the surrounding elements observable in library settings, like bookshelves.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors dark brown, cream, and deep red/blue consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the box utilizes a range of colors such as dark brown and cream, which are consistent with the palette seen in Image A. Both images reflect a classic aesthetic with similar color choices seen in traditional libraries or writing paraphernalia. Hence, the color scheme with particular dark tones and creams remains consistent.",
