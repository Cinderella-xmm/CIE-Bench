      "question": "Are the hands still visibly interacting with and pressing the keys on the keyboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands are clearly positioned over a keyboard, with fingers visibly pressing down on keys. Combining this visual cue with world knowledge about typing or using a keyboard, the positioning and flexing of the fingers indicate interaction typical of pressing keys. Such body language suggests active engagement with the keyboard.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the keyboard retain its original physical layout and key structure despite the added neon effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the keyboard is highlighted with neon effects, but its physical layout, including the arrangement and structure of the keys, remains discernibly intact. Knowledge about standard keyboard designs helps affirm that the neon overlays do not obscure the basic layout, which aligns with its typical appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the laptop's overall body shape and placement relative to the hands consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shape of the laptop in Image B, as well as its placement relative to the hands, closely matches that in Image A. Visual analysis confirms that the hands are proportionally and spatially consistent with the positioning of the laptop akin to Image A, given standard ergonomic laptop use.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the hands retain their general posture and positioning relative to the keyboard as seen in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands maintain a similar posture to those in Image A, with fingers positioned over the keys in a manner representative of typing. This positioning relative to the keyboard appears consistent between the two images, supporting continuous physical interaction despite color and lighting alterations.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image retain realistic textures for the keyboard and the surface under the hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B incorporates vibrant neon lighting, the texture of the keyboard remains evident, reflecting a realistic surface through its visible lines and indentations. Similarly, the surface beneath the hands, though bathed in colorful light, retains a texture consistent with a smooth, solid material.",
