      "question": "Is the kite depicted in the shape of a diamond?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kite is a classic diamond shape, characterized by its four equal sides forming the diamond pattern common in kite design. This is visually evident from the yellow kite depicted in the top section, which mirrors the traditional features associated with diamond-shaped kites.",

      "question": "Does the kite retain its bright yellow color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kite is distinctly yellow, maintaining the bright hue that makes it stand out against other elements. This observation is made based on the color saturation of the kite in the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual inspection reveals a single string attached to the kite. There is no indication of a second string being present, making it clear that only one string is visually attached.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kite is depicted against abstract and stylized backgrounds featuring artistic interpretations rather than a realistic sky, such as the illustrated environments with human figures and landscape elements. Thus, it does not resemble a clear sky setting.",
