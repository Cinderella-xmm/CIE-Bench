    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the woman in the edited image positioned in a three-quarter profile view, facing to the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the woman is facing at an angle that reveals more than a side view, as her body and shoulders are not fully aligned toward one side. This positioning is typical of a three-quarter profile view. Given her orientation relative to the image, she is facing slightly to the left.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the woman’s head tilted downward in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the woman's head isn't tilted downward noticeably. Her neck's alignment with the body suggests she maintains an upright posture, characteristic of wearing formal attire, without any significant downward tilt.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the woman’s arms are bent with her hands clasped together in front of her, not positioned straight down at her sides. This is consistent with the formal pose typical of the attire she is wearing.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the woman is wearing long white gloves that cover her hands entirely, making her fingernails not visible and therefore it cannot be determined if she has white nail polish on.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the woman facing slightly to the left. Her body and shoulders are oriented that way, consistent with a traditional portrait pose that suggests an elegant setting.",
