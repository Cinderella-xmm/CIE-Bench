      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog appears to be a fluffy animal with light-colored fur. Although the face has been blurred, the ears are visible and are primarily white, with no distinct sandy-colored spots visible.

      "question": "Does the dog have a rounded head with pointed ears and a short muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animal's visible features include fluffy fur and pointed ears. While the face has been blurred, the general shape of the head can be inferred as rounded, and the ears are clearly pointed. The muzzle is not visible due to the blur, so we cannot conclusively determine its length, but typical dogs with pointed ears and fluffy hair often have such muzzle characteristics.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any accessories like sunglasses on the dog. The visible parts do not display any indications of eyewear, such as black frames or lenses. The dog's fur pattern is visible, as is the absence of any sunglasses.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is indeed seated on what appears to be a sandy surface, with its body positioned upright and facing directly towards the camera. This posture suggests it is sitting in an attentive manner.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visible parts of Image B suggest that the dog has a compact body typical of smaller breeds, and the legs appear to be short relative to its body size. While the tail is partially obscured due to the blur, the overall fluffiness of the body suggests that the tail is likely fluffy as well.",
