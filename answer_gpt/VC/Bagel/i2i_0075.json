      "question": "Is the cat depicted with fluffy white fur that maintains its distinct texture and coverage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration of the cat shows white fur with some texture added through line work, which is typical of a hand-drawn style. The fluffiness is suggested but not as pronounced as in a photograph due to the flatness of the illustration medium. In Image A, the cat has distinctly fluffy white fur with fine texture visible in high detail, characteristic of a photograph capturing real fur. Hence, while Image B suggests the fluffiness and white color, it lacks the detailed texture and depth seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the illustration retain the cat's yellow-green eyes with visible pupils reflecting the original appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is illustrated with yellow eyes but the precision of color detailing like a green tint and reflection is less obvious in the hand-drawn style, where simplified or exaggerated colors are often used. In Image A, the eyes of the cat are depicted with a yellow-green hue and visible pupils, capturing light reflections accurately. Therefore, while the illustration in Image B has yellow eyes, it does not distinctly retain the greenish tint and reflections seen in the original.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the inner ears of the illustrated cat are depicted with pink shading and have a shape that aligns with typical cat anatomy but are represented more simply. In Image A, the inner ears are shown in a natural pink hue with detailed curvature and texture. The color and shape have been simplified in Image B compared to the detailed natural representation in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the illustration preserve the cat’s relaxed posture with extended paws, consistent with its original positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is depicted sitting with its paws aligned under its body, typical in simplified animal illustrations. In Image A, the cat is lying relaxed with paws extending forward, indicative of a resting posture. The drawing in Image B does not replicate the lie-down, paw-extended posture but shows the cat in a different stance.",

      "question": "Is the subtle floral pattern on the cushion accurately rendered in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not have any background or additional elements like a floral-patterned cushion, focusing solely on the cat illustration against a plain background. In Image A, the cat is resting on a textured surface with a floral pattern. Thus, Image B omits this detail entirely.",
