      "question": "Is the red football with white laces present in the quilt’s design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's no quilt design visible. Instead, it features a block construction with primary colors made from LEGO blocks. The visual depiction doesn't include any sports theme or designs like those found on quilts. Given common knowledge about LEGO creations, they typically focus on geometric shapes with solid color blocks and don’t include detailed patterns like those of quilts. Therefore, the red football with white laces isn't present in the LEGO construction.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the black-and-white soccer ball with hexagonal pattern present in the quilt’s design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B doesn't feature a quilt. It's a LEGO model resembling a bed, with colored LEGO blocks forming a blanket-like design. The limited color palette and simplistic geometric style of LEGO blocks don't allow for detailed representations such as a soccer ball with a distinct hexagonal pattern. Such an intricate pattern requires a specific color organization which isn’t possible with the blocks shown.",

      "question": "Is the orange basketball with black lines present in the quilt’s design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO construction in Image B lacks the elements typically covering quilts, such as sports motifs or intricate designs. LEGO blocks in this context showcase basic color layouts instead of complex shapes or patterns like basketballs. Recognizing the constraints of LEGO constructions in illustrating detailed themes, it is certain there is no orange basketball with black lines present.",

      "question": "Is the white baseball with red stitching present in the quilt’s design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Evaluating Image B, it's apparent that the object isn’t a traditional quilt, but a LEGO creation crafted into a bed form. This setup, made from multicolored bricks, doesn’t express the sophistication needed to recreate a baseball design accurately. Given world knowledge about typical LEGO limitations and design scope, detailed motifs like a baseball with red stitching aren't observable here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the quilt composed of a grid of colored squares arranged in a patchwork pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's a LEGO arrangement forming a blanket look-alike design. This configuration indeed does rely on a basic grid or block layout typical for LEGO sets, resulting from the natural grouping of bricks in rows and columns. While it isn’t textile, it does emulate a patchwork concept, but it isn’t a quilt per se.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are blue and white stars present between the sports ball motifs in the quilt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks traditional quilt elements, employing instead a set of colored LEGO bricks. Given that this medium supports simple geometric creation rather than ornate designs, finding specific motifs such as stars is implausible within this framework. Thus, blue and white stars integrated alongside sports motifs are absent.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the sports balls positioned in the same relative locations within the patchwork grid as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B doesn't consist of any sports balls or their arrangements. Instead, it presents a LEGO-based visual composition that lacks specific placements or representations akin to those observed in patterned quilts. Consequently, comparisons on relative positioning against an item not visually present are moot. No identical location or motif can be recognized.",
