      "question": "Is the clock face present on the upper section of the left bell tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left bell tower's upper section does not show a discernible clock face, as it appears to be part of a miniature or a diorama, which often lacks detailed elements found in real-life architecture. Normally, clock faces are large and prominent features on tower sections designed for them. Thus, based on the representation of Image B, the clock face is absent.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there two bells visible in the arches of the right bell tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the diorama style suggests simplified details. The right bell tower seems to have generic openings without the depiction of bells. Normally, bells are contained within open archways and are a key auditory element of bell towers, but the artistic representation doesn't clearly show them here.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a circular stained-glass window with a floral or star-like pattern centered above the main entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a simplified version of the architecture where a decorative element is positioned above the main entrance, typically suggesting a circular stained-glass window. However, in the artistic depiction, detailed patterns like floral or star-like are not clear.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a cross positioned at the highest point of the central roofline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a structure at the top of the central roofline resembling a typical church cross. It's common for churches to have a cross as a symbolic element, especially at the peak.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there three doors on the façade: one large central door and two smaller side doors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B's depiction, you can observe the central large door clearly, but the smaller doors to its sides are part of an implied architectural resemblance rather than distinct entities, given the diorama's limited detailing.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the façade demonstrates a miniature representation of symmetry with vertical divisions suggestive of columns or pilasters, typical features that imitate real-world architectural styles.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the left bell tower have a pinkish dome with a cross on top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image displays a simplified version of the left bell tower and does not distinctly show a pinkish dome or a cross on top as it lacks coloring details usually found in true representations of the architectural element.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right side seems enclosed within the diorama's frame and does not show detailed structures, like multi-story buildings with balconies or railings, which are typical urban architectural features next to such historical edifices.",
