    "Question": "Q1: Does the bandage retain its rounded rectangular shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object that was originally a bandage has been transformed into a Funko Pop figure styled like a bandage. The object's overall shape is not a rounded rectangle but a humanoid figure. Therefore, the bandage does not retain its original shape, and this change is reinforced by the context of the boxed toy character.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the central adhesive strip still present in the same relative position and size?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the entire concept of a central adhesive strip is replaced by a humanoid toy. There is no visible adhesive strip indicative of a bandage. Thus, the point of having a central adhesive strip in the same position and size is not applicable to the transformed object in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the bandage retain its visible fabric texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the original bandage is now depicted as a Funko Pop figure. The texture of the figure is akin to a stylized toy and does not resemble the fabric texture of a medical bandage. The visual design represents a heavily stylized version that suggests a bandage through patterns rather than texture.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the bandage's overall proportions consistent with the original image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the transformation of the bandage into a Funko Pop character changes its proportions entirely. The overall dimensions now align with those of a humanoid figure, inconsistent with the original bandage's simple, elongated rectangular shape.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a shadow cast by the bandage, contributing to its three-dimensional appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the Funko Pop figure and its packaging have replaced the bandage, with a focus on a three-dimensional toy and box presentation. The lighting may illustrate dimensionality in the product depiction, but the dynamics of a shadow as displayed in Image A are obscured by the new context and form.",
    "answer": "No"
