      "question": "Does the edited image retain the deep, blocky lug pattern of the tire treads?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of tires or any object resembling the deep, blocky lug pattern found in tire treads. Instead, Image B shows a mechanical, armored armadillo-like creature. Given this significant difference and absence of any tire-like structure, the answer is No.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the embossed text \"ROCKS TIRE\" and \"SUPER SWAMPER\" visible on the sidewalls of the tires?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any tires or sidewalls to have embossed text. This image features a robotic armadillo-like creature without any text similar to what's found on a tire sidewall. Thus, the answer is No.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the five-spoke designs of the wheel hubs still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), there is an armadillo-like robot with glowing elements, but there aren't any wheel hubs or any object resembling a five-spoke design. Therefore, the answer is No.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the matte, rubber-textured surface of the tires maintained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a shiny, metallic armadillo-like creature without any matte or rubber-like texture typical of tires. The surface is more metallic and mechanical in nature. Thus, the answer is No.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no tread blocks visible in Image B; it depicts a robotic armadillo rather than tires. As a result, the edited image does not feature any tread blocks, making the answer No.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any tires, but instead has a single armadillo-like creature. There are no objects resembling a stack of tires, which clearly differs in structure and number from the original image with four tires. Thus, the answer is No.",
