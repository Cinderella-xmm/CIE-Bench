    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the red-and-white checkered keffiyeh still present on the man’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's headwear is part of a stylized illustration featuring geometric patterns in brown and beige tones, consistent with artistic depiction rather than a specific checkered design. World knowledge suggests the illustrated style wouldn't maintain the specific red-and-white checkered pattern of a keffiyeh, as seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a monocle positioned over the man’s right eye?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an illustrated representation of a figure holding a book, but it doesn't indicate any presence of a monocle. The artistic nature suggests minimal accessories and doesn't highlight details like a monocle.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the man holding an open newspaper with both hands and looking at it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man holds an open book as opposed to a newspaper, indicated by its stylized and geometric design. The absence of newspaper-format text and its artistic presentation confirms this deduction, contrasting Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there Arabic script visible in the top-right corner of the newspaper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stylized book with decorative elements, and the text is positioned above it and features an artistic font not identifiable as Arabic script due to the abstract or possibly nonsensical nature of the text style.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there three open books on the desk: one on the left, one on the right, and one in front of the newspaper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is lacking distinct furniture like a desk. Decorative elements surround the illustrated man, with only one visible book in the hands of the subject. Unlike Image A, open books on a desk are absent from this stylized representation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the man seated at a dark wooden desk with visible legs and surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts an artistic illustration lacking realistic furniture details such as a desk. The surrounding decoration implies a background rather than any tangible desk structure present in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is a patterned Persian-style rug visible beneath the desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses ornate illustration motifs, distinct from actual furniture and fixtures, such as a patterned rug seen in Image A. The absence of a realistic scene or any desk negates the depiction of a Persian-style rug.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is there a window on the left side of the image allowing daylight to enter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, stylized art surrounds the figure without specifying any architectural elements like a window for daylight, differing from Image A's background, where a window is visible.",
