      "question": "Is the NASA logo clearly visible on the left shoulder of the space suit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the space suit depicts a logo on the upper area of the suit, which is similar in placement to where the NASA logo is in Image A. However, the logo herein is not distinctly visible or recognizable due to the illustrative style and alterations. The use of simulative elements implies the representation of a NASA suit but not a clear logo, whereas in Image A, the NASA logo is clearly visible on the left shoulder. Thus, based on Image B alone, the logo’s distinct visibility is not apparent.",

      "question": "Are the red trim bands visible on the upper arm and lower leg of the space suit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit has visible red trim bands on the upper arm and lower leg, similar to those in Image A, where the red bands are used as design features. Hence, observing Image B alone, these identifiable red bands are indeed visible.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the white backpack unit attached to the back of the suit, with coiled white hoses extending down the sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an astronaut-like illustration with a backpack-like object; however, there are no visible coiled white hoses extending down from the backpack. Contrastingly, in Image A, the backpack and hoses are explicitly visible. Therefore, Image B does not depict these specific attachments prominently or at all.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the helmet’s visor partially raised, revealing part of the astronaut’s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visor fully covers the face without any visible opening. This contrasts with the potential visor adjustment observable in Image A. Hence, in the edited image, no part of the face is revealed through the visor.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the astronaut standing upright with their body oriented to the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustrated astronaut appears to be facing forward rather than oriented to the right side. In Image A, the astronaut is visibly standing with the body oriented towards the right. Consequently, based on Image B’s depiction, the body orientation is not towards the right side.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the hoses visibly connected from the backpack to the suit at the torso area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration depicts no discernible hoses visibly connecting any part of the suit to a backpack. Image A, however, shows clear connections with hoses to the torso area. Therefore, Image B lacks such visible hose connections.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the astronaut’s boots and gloves visible and properly attached to the suit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the astronaut-like figure with boots and gloves, which are stylized and depicted as part of the suit, congruent with attachment perception. In Image A, the boots and gloves are clearly part of the astronaut outfit, confirming the attachment. Thus, based solely on Image B, the depiction of boots and gloves is consistent with proper attachment.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible floor covering like a blue tarp depicted beneath the illustrated astronaut. The setting in Image A includes a blue tarp, indicating floor coverage. Therefore, in Image B, this feature is absent.",
