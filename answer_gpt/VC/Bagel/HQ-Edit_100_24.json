      "question": "Is the dragon embroidery clearly visible on the left side of the chest, with detailed scales and a raised texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green traditional dress features a prominent dragon embroidery on the left side, with intricate details like scales that appear raised, indicating the embroidery is meant to appear textured and three-dimensional, common in traditional attire designs.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the peony and vine floral patterns visible along the right side of the dress, matching the original arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show peony and vine floral patterns along the right side of the dress. Instead, it features dragon motifs on a green fabric, diverging from any floral patterns that might have been present originally. Therefore, the floral patterns do not match any existing arrangement from the previous image.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the subject retain her original facial features, including the shape of the eyes, nose, and lips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis process can't determine the facial features since both images have blurred faces, which obscures the shape of the eyes, nose, and lips. Therefore, any comparison or description of facial features cannot be inferred from the images provided.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hands are presented together in front of the waist, but they do not appear interlaced. Instead, they are placed side by side, implying a different positioning than fingers being interlaced.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a green silk fabric, so there's no visible red silk fabric to assess for reflective sheen or fine weave details. The analysis is based on the textile observed in Image B which reflects the change in color and motif.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject appears to maintain natural body proportions, including a balanced posture with a natural curvature of the spine. The shoulders appear evenly set, consistent with classic portraiture maintaining natural body proportions.",
