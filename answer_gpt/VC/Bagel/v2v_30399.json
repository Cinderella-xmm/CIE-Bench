      "question": "Are the brown and white mesh patterns visible on the giraffes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffes are depicted with a stylized, cartoonish pattern with simplified spots instead of the realistic brown and white mesh pattern seen on giraffes in nature. This suggests that the intricate natural patterning visible on real giraffes is not preserved in this artistic rendition. When comparing with Image A, where the real giraffes display their characteristic complex brown patches surrounded by lighter areas, Image B's simplified spots confirm that the natural complex pattern is not visible.",

      "question": "Are the ossicones present on the giraffes' heads?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each giraffe has protrusions on their heads resembling ossicones, which are the horn-like structures found on giraffes. This indicates that these features were preserved in the artistic rendition as recognizable characteristics of giraffes. In Image A, the giraffes also have these protrusions, confirming their presence in both images.",

      "question": "Are the giraffes positioned naturally relative to the grassy field and trees in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffes are set against a plain white background, and there are no environmental elements like grass or trees present. This makes them appear isolated rather than positioned within a natural setting. By comparison, Image A features giraffes naturally situated in a grassy field with trees in the background, supporting a realistic setting for the animals. Thus, the giraffes in Image B cannot be considered naturally positioned relative to a grassy field and trees.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is entirely white, devoid of any landscape features like grass, trees, or rocks. This contrasts with a natural setting. When comparing this with Image A, where the background is indeed composed of a grassy field, trees, and rocks, Image B's complete lack of these elements indicates a significantly different and simplified artistic choice.",

      "question": "Does the general body structure of the giraffes, including their legs and torso, remain intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features giraffes in a stylized and exaggerated artistic form. While the general shape of the legs and long neck is retained, the stylistic exaggerations and simplifications deviate from the realistic proportions and muscle structure seen in Image A. Image A shows realistic giraffes with appropriate proportions and anatomy, whereas Image B uses artistic interpretations that alter these. Despite this, the giraffes are still recognizable in form, albeit with stylized changes.",
