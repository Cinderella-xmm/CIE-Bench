      "question": "Is the black bat with outstretched wings inside a red circle present on the label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the label features a design element at the top that resembles a black bat with outstretched wings inside a circle, similar to Bacardi's known logo. Given the presence and similarity to this brand element in the edited image, it can be concluded that the black bat with outstretched wings inside a red circle is present on the label.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the word \"BACARDÍ\" displayed in bold black serif font above the word \"MOJITO\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the label on the blocky, Lego-like bottle contains the word 'BACARDÍ' in a prominent position, appearing to be in bold black serif font above the word 'MOJITO'. This setup aligns with common brand labeling practices for Bacardi products.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the word \"MOJITO\" written in green sans-serif font below \"BACARDÍ\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'MOJITO' appears on the label and is positioned below 'BACARDÍ'. The font is green and sans-serif, which is a straightforward style choice for clarity and thematic consistency with the beverage type.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the signature \"Facundo Bacardí\" in cursive script present below the product name?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the simplified Lego-style bottle label does not include the cursive script signature 'Facundo Bacardí', a detail that might be omitted due to the stylistic abstraction or simplification inherent in the Lego design aesthetic.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is a mint leaf icon visible near the bottom of the label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the label does not exhibit detail such as a mint leaf icon, likely due to the reduction in complexity of designs typical in Lego-style representation, which often focuses on major branding elements over finer detail.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The label in Image B has likely been simplified given its Lego-like design. Detailed descriptive text like 'natural mint flavor, lime juice, cane sugar' would not fit well with the blocky, playful nature of the Lego style. Therefore, these words don't appear to be included.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the presence of key branding elements, the detailed phrase 'Simply pour over ice' does not appear to be present, aligning with the simplified style common for Lego interpretations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the text \"15% ALC. BY VOL.\" visible on the label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible small text commonly associated with detailed product information like '15% ALC. BY VOL.', which has been omitted likely due to the focus on larger, more visually recognizable branding in Lego designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Does the bottle maintain a curved body with a narrow neck, resembling the original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a bottle shape that is distinctly different from the original curved bottle with a narrow neck, instead taking on a blocky, rectangular form commonly associated with Lego assemblies, therefore not resembling the original shape.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle prominently features a blue cylindrical cap, consistent with Lego design elements which often continue the simplistic geometric shapes approach, suggesting its cylindrical nature.",
