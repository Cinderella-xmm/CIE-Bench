      "question": "Are the hedges arranged in a straight line with consistent cubic shapes and even spacing along the left side of the pathway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the hedges organized in a neat, straight line with consistent cubic shapes. They appear evenly spaced along the pathway, creating a uniform visual appearance that aligns with typical landscape design principles. Such arrangements often aim for aesthetic orderliness in public parks.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pathway extends from the foreground directly toward the Eiffel Tower in a straight trajectory. This type of layout is common in large, open, structured spaces like parks where pathways lead directly to major landmarks for ease of navigation.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sun in Image B is positioned in the upper-left corner of the sky, exhibiting a pronounced starburst effect as it radiates outward, which is a common artistic representation of bright sunlight in photography and design.",
