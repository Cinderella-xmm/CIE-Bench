      "question": "Is the three-pointed star emblem present on the front grille?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the emblem on the front grille is round and does not resemble the distinct three-pointed star typically associated with Mercedes-Benz. The absence of the star pattern confirms that the emblem is different from a typical Mercedes-Benz one. Therefore, no three-pointed star is visible on the grille in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car doors are clearly open upward from the roofline, characterized by their unique hinge placement at the top of the car, which is the defining feature of gullwing doors. This door style is visually apparent, matching the traditional design considered for gullwing doors.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area behind the front wheel does not exhibit the presence of a vertical slit-shaped air intake. The side of the car appears smooth without any noticeable opening or intake design. Thus, there is no vertical slit-shaped air intake in this region.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible 'SLS' badge near the rear wheel arch or any recognizable badge in that location. The design elements seem more generic and do not contain specific branding or model identifiers familiar in automotive designs, particularly not an 'SLS' badge.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays wheels that resemble a modern design with multiple spokes. However, they do not conform to a classic five-spoke pattern typical in alloy wheels. The spokes appear more intricate and differ from the usual five-spoke layout.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the interior seats are visible through the open doors, showing a white color. The material appears to be consistent with leather, which is commonly used in luxury car interiors. Thus, the seats seem to be white and made of leather.",
