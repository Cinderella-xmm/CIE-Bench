      "question": "Does the edited image retain the presence of the bed as the central object?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the central object is a small and colorful cat illustration, likely a pin or patch, and not a bed. The bed, a large and substantial item, is not present in Image B. Thus, common sense and visual comparison lead to the conclusion that the central object in Image B is not a bed.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the warm glow from the lamp and candles?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no indication of lighting such as a lamp or candles, which are evident in Image A as they contribute to its warm glow. Instead, Image B shows a brightly colored object with no light sources or lighting effects present. With common knowledge, this indicates that the warm glow seen in Image A does not exist in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the soft texture representation of the bedding?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a smooth surface with a cartoonish illustration, lacking any texture resembling fabric or bedding. Image A features a bed with visible soft textures in the blankets and sheets. Thus, comparison and common knowledge reasoning show that Image B does not retain the bedding textures from Image A.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the arrangement of pillows on the bed?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) does not depict any pillows or a bed. Instead, it shows a stylized graphic of a cat cartoon. Therefore, based on the visual evidence and common knowledge, there is no arrangement of pillows present in Image B that can match anything from Image A.",

      "model_answer": "no",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the position of the bedside table relative to the bed?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire setup of a bed and bedside table is missing, replaced by a cartoon-like figure. Image A contains a clear bedside table next to the bed. Since no such arrangement exists in Image B, common spatial knowledge confirms that the bedside table's position relative to the bed is not retained.",
