      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show the woman wearing spectacles. From the appearance, they resemble round glasses, but they do not show clear gold rims, rather they appear black. This combined with the knowledge of typical spectacle styles suggests they are not gold-rimmed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
