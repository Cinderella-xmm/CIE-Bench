        "** Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show that both skiers are wearing red jackets. Based on visual information, the distinct colors of jackets in Image A, where one skier wears a red jacket and the other a blue one, is altered to both wearing red in Image B. This indicates that the edited skiers do not maintain their original jacket colors, leading to the conclusion that they are not wearing red and blue jackets respectively in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, it is clear from the visual cues that the figures are equipped with skis and ski poles. Combining this observation with common knowledge about skiing equipment, we can confirm that the skis and poles are indeed present in the edited image. This aligns with Image A, where the skiers also have these items.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Visual cues in Image B show the skiers carrying backpacks that are dark in color, appearing to be black. Common understanding of backpack straps and their typical appearance further confirms that the backpacks are black, similar to those in Image A where the skiers carry notably dark backpacks.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background retains the snowy forest setting. However, the foggy atmosphere is replaced by a clear visible background, unlike in Image A where a foggy ambiance with dense mist is characteristic. Hence, the snowy forest elements remain, but the foggy aspect does not.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual orientation in Image B shows that the figures are aligned side by side, facing forward, as inferred from their direction relative to the path and the perspective lines. This positioning mirrors Image A, where the skiers are similarly placed side by side facing forward.",
