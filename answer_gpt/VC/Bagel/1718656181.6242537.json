      "question": "Is the mushroom cloud shape (with a distinct stem and cap) present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the explosion is depicted with a clear mushroom cloud shape, characterized by a distinct stem leading to a large cap-like cloud structure. This aligns with world knowledge of explosions creating this recognizable shape. Therefore, based on this visual information analysis, the edited image does show a mushroom cloud shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a landmass beneath the explosion in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an island-like landmass directly beneath the explosion. This is identifiable through flat surface representations and colors that typically suggest land in abstract art forms. This interpretation is consistent with world knowledge of depictions involving islands or similar land forms beneath explosions.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sea surround the island in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a blue area presumed to represent water is visible surrounding the landmass depicted as the island, indicating the presence of the sea. Based on world knowledge of coastal geography and the visual cues indicating water, the sea does surround the island in the edited image.",
      "weight": 2,

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are palm trees visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes abstract forms and symbols that are stylized representations of palm trees, identifiable by their long trunks and fan-like leaf structures typical of palm trees seen in coastal and tropical regions. Utilizing world knowledge of palm tree features, palm trees are visibly represented in the edited image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the explosion positioned directly over the island in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The explosion in Image B is visually situated directly above the island-like landmass. Based on the alignment and position of the explosion cloud relative to the visible land area, it can be reasoned that the explosion occurs directly over the island as per typical artistic interpretations of such scenes.",
