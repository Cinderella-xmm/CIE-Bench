    "Question": "Q1: Is the subject's serene expression with the subtle smile retained?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, despite the face being blurred, the posture and hand placement convey a sense of calmness which is usually consistent with a serene facial expression. In Image A, the Mona Lisa is known for her serene expression and subtle smile. Without seeing the face in Image B, it's not explicitly visible, so based solely on world knowledge of serene posture, we conclude the expression cannot be confirmed.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the subject wearing a dark garment with a gold-trimmed neckline?",

In Image A, the Mona Lisa traditionally wears a dress with a dark color and a subtle decorative trim. The comparison indicates that the key features of the garment are preserved in the edited image.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are the subject's arms crossed in front of her at the waist?",
