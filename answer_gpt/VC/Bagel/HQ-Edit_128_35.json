      "question": "Is the curved carriage of the typewriter present and accurately shaped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) is a book cover design featuring imprints of typewriter keys which mimic the design of a typewriter, but it does not have physical elements like a typewriter. It lacks a typewriter carriage or any shape that could form a physical typewriter structure. Therefore, there is no indication of a curved carriage.",

      "question": "Are the round silver key caps arranged in a QWERTY layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not contain an actual keyboard but rather a book cover design. It may use decorative elements resembling typewriter keys on the spine as an artistic metaphor. Since it's a book cover, the detailed arrangement like a QWERTY layout is not possible, unlike in actual keyboards.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), there is no physical typewriter; it's a book cover with abstract design elements. Hence, there would be no place for a typewriter brand marking like 'Underwood' which would typically be found on an actual typewriter.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a book cover design and not an actual typewriter; hence, detailed elements like a radial fan-like pattern beneath the carriage that can be physically found on a typewriter are absent.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, which is a book cover artwork, elements like side knobs and left levers which are found on a typewriter are not physically present as it is not depicting an actual typewriter.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not display an actual typewriter but rather a book cover titled 'Tales Untold,' utilizing design elements that simulate the concept of a typewriter without showing a glossy black body.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image is a creative book cover, not an actual typewriter setup. As a result, there is no physical manifestation of a platen roller above where a keyboard might be imaged. The image does not display such intricate detail since it is not showing any typewriter at all.",
