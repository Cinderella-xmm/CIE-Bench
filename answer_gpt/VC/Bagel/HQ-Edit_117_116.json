    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the pink-red feathery flower clusters present in both the foreground and background, positioned on slender green stems?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on a fantastical creature in an underwater environment, with no presence of any flower-like structures. The background consists primarily of swirling aquatic plants, not resembling flowers either in the foreground or background. Thus, given this description, the pink-red feathery flower clusters on slender green stems do not exist in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a clear, symmetrical reflection of the dragonfly visible on the water surface directly beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the environment is underwater, and the main subject is an imaginary creature, not a dragonfly. There is no water surface involved where reflections are applicable in this context. Therefore, no dragonfly reflection exists in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the water surface calm and reflective, with small sparkling particles scattered across it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts an underwater scene with no water surface or reflections. The atmosphere is illuminated, likely from subsurface light, enhancing the creature's luminous appearance, not resembling a calm water surface with sparkling particles present in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the dragonfly hovering just above the water surface, with its body parallel to the water plane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's main subject is a blue, winged creature underwater. There is no dragonfly depicted, and no water plane where hovering is applicable.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a bright, diffused light source in the upper center of the image, casting a golden glow through the green foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B involves an underwater scene. The light source is not a golden glow coming through foliage; rather, it appears as a soft light typical of an underwater setting, emphasizing the glow of the creature itself.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there slender green stems and leafy structures extending from the water, supporting the pink-red flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are swirling vine-like structures, but they lack any pink-red flowers. The underwater theme of Image B does not suggest the presence of green stems with pink-red flowers seen above a water surface, as in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the background composed of blurred green foliage with visible patches of sunlight filtering through?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's background simulates the underwater environment, featuring watery textures and lighting without any blurred foliage or sunlight. The image thus lacks the characteristics of an outdoor botanical setting.",

      "is_correct": false
