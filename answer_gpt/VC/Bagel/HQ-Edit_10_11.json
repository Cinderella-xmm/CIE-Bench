    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the gorilla depicted in a seated pose with its left hand resting under its chin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object resembles a carved depiction of a gorilla. The gorilla is shown in a seated position with its left hand resting under its chin, matching common imagery of thoughtful poses, reminiscent of the Thinker statue pose.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the gorilla have a prominent brow ridge, wide nose, and strong jawline consistent with a silverback gorilla?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a gorilla as a carved wooden representation, where intricate details like brow ridge, nose, and jawline may not be prominently detailed due to the artistic and simplified nature of carvings. Therefore, it does not consistently show features characteristic of a silverback gorilla.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a distinct patch resembling a silver saddle located across the back and shoulders of the gorilla?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction is a carved wooden form that uses a single color to highlight features. A silver saddle patch cannot be discerned as the entire form consists of a uniform wooden texture, lacking the color contrast typical of a silverback gorilla.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the gorilla positioned on a horizontal surface that resembles a log or platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The carved figure in Image B appears not to be positioned on any discernible horizontal surface like a log. Instead, it is embedded as a flat carving against a wooden background.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the gorilla’s right arm resting on its right knee?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The carving in Image B displays the gorilla’s right arm resting on its right knee, indicative of a thoughtful pose, often seen in art and sculptures, and continues to align with the posture seen typically in such representations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the gorilla’s gaze directed forward and slightly downward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While in Image B, the artistic representation doesn't provide specific detail on eye direction due to the carving style, the overall pose suggests a contemplative look that might imply the head slightly angled forward and downward. Thus, a precise gaze direction is ambiguous.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there leaf-shaped elements present in the background, even if stylized or etched?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background displays stylized leaf-shaped elements surrounding the carved gorilla figure, adding a thematic aesthetic suggestive of a natural habitat or artistic embellishment linking to nature.",
