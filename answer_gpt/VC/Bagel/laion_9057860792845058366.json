    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the two orange horn-like protrusions on the top of the robot's head present and unchanged in shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe two orange horn-like protrusions positioned symmetrically on top of the robot's head, similar in placement to those in Image A. The shape and position of these horns appear consistent between both images, indicating no changes. This can be deduced by studying their alignment with the rest of the head structure which remains unchanged across both images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the large red rectangular plate on the robot's chest intact, maintaining its original size, shape, and placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chest area of the robot does not contain a clear large red rectangular plate as seen in Image A. Instead, there is a blue-lit central emblem suggesting significant alterations. Comparing to Image A, the red plate is replaced by a light-up detail, indicating a change in the chest design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the red knee pads present on both legs, positioned at the joint area and matching the original shape and color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot’s joints do not feature the red knee pads visible in Image A. Image B displays a sleek, metallic design without the specific red accents on the knee area, reflecting a difference in design elements, including the absence of these red knee pads.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the hands of the robot fully black, with a claw-like or articulated finger design, and positioned as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the robot with hands that appear metallic and integrated into a seamless design, different from the black claw-like fingers noted in Image A. The position also contrasts as Image B presents a more upright stance rather than articulated finger placement.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the robot’s feet maintain their angular, blocky shape with black toe segments and red accent plates near the ankles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot’s foot design is noticeably altered, showcasing shiny metallic elements. The angular blocky shape with black toe segments and red accents from Image A is not preserved, highlighting a clear change in design aesthetics for the feet.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the robot in the same dynamic standing pose, with the left arm slightly raised and the body angled toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot is standing in a fully upright posture, with both arms down or at the sides, differing substantially from the dynamic pose in Image A where the robot's left arm is slightly raised and the body is angled forward. There is a stark contrast in posture between the images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the primary colors of the robot—white, gray, red, and orange—preserved in their original distribution and intensity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a predominantly shiny metallic color palette without the white, gray, red, and orange distribution noted in Image A. The colors in Image B feature darker, more reflective tones with blue highlights, signaling a deviation from the original color scheme.",
