    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the facial structure including the eyes, nose, beard, and smile preserved exactly as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial structure is not visible due to the blurring applied to the face. Therefore, any specific details such as eyes, nose, beard, and smile cannot be analyzed or compared to Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the blue and green floral henna designs on the cheeks present and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show the cheeks clearly due to the blurring effect. The floral henna designs are not visible, making it impossible to determine their presence or any changes.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the small gold earrings visible in both ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area where earrings would be visible is affected by blurring. As a result, the gold earrings are not discernible. For earrings to be recognized, they need to be clearly visible, which is not the case here.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "question": "Is the peacock feather held in the right hand present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the peacock feather is prominently held by the right hand in front of the chest, indicating its presence is unchanged from the original image.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the right hand positioned near the chest, holding the peacock feather?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right hand is clearly positioned near the chest area, holding the peacock feather. The positioning suggests continuity from the original image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the subject looking upward and toward the left side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the blurring of the facial area in Image B, the direction of the gaze cannot be assessed or compared to Image A. Thus, the orientation of the subject's gaze is indiscernible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the natural skin tone and texture of the subject preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurring in Image B obstructs the view of any skin tone and texture. Without clear visibility, determining the preservation of skin tone and texture is not feasible.",
