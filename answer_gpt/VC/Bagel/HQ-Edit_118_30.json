      "question": "Is the number \"1902\" clearly visible on the front of the locomotive?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the locomotive displays the number '1904' rather than '1902'. This number is clearly visible on the locomotive, and while it closely resembles '1902', the digits are different. This outcome can be determined by directly observing the front of the locomotive and noting the number presented.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the locomotive retain a dominant green color on its body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the locomotive does not have a green color; instead, it is predominantly blue, with various colorful elements, such as red, orange, and other hues. This observation can be drawn by looking at the locomotive's visible surfaces and noting the primary colors used.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the station building constructed from stone material with visible texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no clearly discernible station building constructed from stone. The focus is on a colorful model train and colorful puzzle pieces, rather than any traditional architectural structures. The lack of stone material or texture on a building suggests it is not present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there moss growing on the roof of the station building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features no discernible station building with a roof to examine for moss. The image is dominated by puzzle pieces and a stylized train, lacking structural details like a roof where moss growth might occur.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there luggage trunks present on the platform near the passengers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is dominated by a toy train setup with puzzle pieces, lacking any realistic details such as platforms or passengers, let alone luggage trunks. This conclusion is reached by focusing on the key elements present, which are colorful blocks and a toy train.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are wind turbines visible on the hilltop in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any large scenic background elements that could support wind turbines. The setting is limited to a playful, miniature environment with puzzle pieces and a toy train. Therefore, no wind turbines are visible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the railway track visibly curved as it extends into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colorful toy train is set on a flat surface with puzzle pieces rather than an actual railway track, making it impossible for a real track to appear curved. The expectation is absent in the context provided by the playful setup.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there wooden benches on the platform where passengers are seated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a bright, colorful toy scene with no visible, realistic seating arrangements like wooden benches. The focus is on blocks and a toy train, rather than passenger amenities on a real platform.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Do the figures on the platform wear clothing consistent with early 20th-century fashion (e.g., top hats, long dresses)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene includes small, abstract figures as part of the toy setup, which do not have detailed clothing that can be associated with early 20th-century fashion. The toy train and puzzle environment emphasize playful abstraction over historical accuracy.",
