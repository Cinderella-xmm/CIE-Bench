    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the overall shape of each earring a symmetrical, elongated feather with pointed tips at both ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's feather-like structure is visible. By visually analyzing this image, it is clear that the feather element does not have pointed tips at both ends, nor is it symmetrical as depicted. It is part of the character's design, representing wings rather than earrings, and does not imply symmetry or pointed tips at both ends, unlike typical feather earrings. This disproves the presence of symmetrical, elongated feather shapes in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does each earring contain a centrally located oval black stone set within a metallic bezel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a character shows a presence of circular elements reminiscent of the design in some earrings. However, these elements are integrated into the wings of a cartoon angel and not presented as earrings. These decorative circles are abstract and do not match typical features of black stones set in metallic bezels. Thus, we conclude Image B lacks these jewelry characteristics.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there fine, parallel engraved lines extending outward from the central spine on both sides of the feather?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's design does include wing-like features that could be interpreted as feathers. However, these elements are stylized and cartoonish without displaying parallel engraved lines typical in detailed feather designs seen in jewelry. This diminishes the resemblance to detailed engraved feather earrings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the metal of the earrings rendered in a silver tone with a matte or slightly oxidized (antiqued) finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no indication of metal or ear jewelry. The imagery consists of cartoon characters with no metallic tones that could suggest a jewelry finish. Therefore, it does not resemble silver toned or antiqued earrings.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does each earring include a curved hook earwire connected via a small spherical bead to the main feather body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The designs in Image B deviate from actual earring structures, as they do not demonstrate the components such as earwires or beads. Instead, these components are abstract elements of the character illustration. Thus, the structure connecting earwires with beads is absent.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the two earrings identical in shape, size, and orientation, mirrored across a vertical axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents characters with wing-like designs as part of the cartoon element, rather than earrings. These components are integrated non-symmetrically within the design and are not replicated or mirrored with identical dimensions or orientation.",
