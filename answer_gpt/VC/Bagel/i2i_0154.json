        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Mustang logo is prominently displayed on the grille in all the various angles provided such as front and front-angled views.

      "question": "Does the side view of the car include the GT badge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the side view clearly showcases the car's design, including the areas typically featuring badges. Examining the section of the car where the GT badge would usually be located, it's not visible in the side view presented. This could be due to image editing or angle differences in depiction. Such a badge, commonly part of the Mustang's trim, would be noticeable if present.",
