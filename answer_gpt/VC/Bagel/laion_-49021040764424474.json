      "question": "Is the \"Wildtrak\" badge visible on the lower side fender of the vehicle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which is a LEGO model of a pickup truck, there is no visible distinct 'Wildtrak' badge. The truck is constructed from LEGO blocks, and such details as badges are typically not represented in LEGO models unless explicitly added with decals or printed bricks. Therefore, based on common knowledge of LEGO designs and visual observation, the badge is not visible.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the tailgate fully lowered, exposing the truck bed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a LEGO model of a pickup truck with the tailgate in a lowered position. The orientation and construction of the blocks imply that the back part is open, thus revealing the truck bed. The LEGO design mimics how a truck with a lowered tailgate is structured but in a simplified form typical of LEGO toys.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there two rear doors visible on the passenger side of the truck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO model truck has a simplified design where the details such as doors are not distinctly represented as in a real vehicle. LEGO models often don't have working doors distinct on the side due to their small scale, thus it's not possible to identify two rear doors distinctly.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the rear taillights have a vertical orientation with a red upper portion and clear lower section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a LEGO model of a truck where the details of taillights are represented by LEGO bricks. The model uses color blocks to represent details, but they don't mimic the exact coloring or style found in real vehicles' taillights, such as those with a red upper portion and clear lower section.",

      "question": "Is a roof rack visible on top of the cab?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, which shows a LEGO truck model, the roof does not exhibit additional structures indicative of a roof rack. A roof rack would be represented by added LEGO bricks or parts on the top, which are not present.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Is there black trim running along the edge of the windows and the bed surround?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO model shows simplistic window trims, often portrayed by using black-colored LEGO bricks. There is an indication of black bricks used around the window area which can be interpreted as an attempt to simulate window trims often seen in real vehicles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the rear wheels positioned within distinct wheel arches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a LEGO truck where the wheels are attached to sections representing wheel arches. This is a common feature in both real and LEGO vehicles to provide a frame around the wheels. These are created using LEGO elements that mimic the rounded shape typical of wheel arches.",
