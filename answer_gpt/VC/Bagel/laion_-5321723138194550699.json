      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the number 18 present on the rear wing of the car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rear wing does not feature any recognizable numbered markings or text like in Image A. The visual cues from Image B show a simplified, stylized version of the car with exaggerated features typical for artistic interpretations, such as cartoon renditions. Common sense tells us that details like the number 18 can be omitted under these artistic styles.",

      "question": "Is the \"Bobcat\" logo visible on the top wing of the car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which is an artistic and simplified rendering of the car, distinct logos or brands like 'Bobcat' found on Image A are not detailed. The simplified cartoon style focuses on broader forms and much less on specific detailing like logos.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the \"AMERICAN EXPRESS\" text visible along the leading edge of the wing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the car in a cartoon style, where the finer details like 'AMERICAN EXPRESS' along the leading edge of the wing found in Image A are not represented. The artistic style often omits or changes text for stylization.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'ROYAL FLOORING' text from the original Image A is indeed adapted into the illustration, maintaining its visibility. This suggests the artist deliberately included or emphasized it within the transformed artistic vision.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the driver is depicted with exaggerated features typical in cartoon style, including wearing a helmet. Common knowledge about animated or cartoon interpretations often retains the main elements to convey the character essence.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the characteristic high wing of the sprint car, as seen in Image A. The stylistic adaptation preserves its angular shape as a defining feature of the car, aligning with the silhouette commonly associated with such vehicles.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the essential low-profile silhouette of a sprint car, complete with wide rear and narrow front tires, similar to Image A. Despite the stylistic and cartoonish alterations, the hallmark elements of the car's profile are represented.",
