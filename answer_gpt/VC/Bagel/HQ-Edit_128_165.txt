    "Question": "Q1: Are the two visible dark brown wooden ceiling beams, one running diagonally and one vertically, present and positioned as in the original image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no indication of wooden ceiling beams, but instead, the image depicts a jellyfish in an aquatic environment. Based on visual cues and knowledge that jellyfish typically reside in vast open water, this environment doesn't include wooden beams. Image A displays a human-made interior for comparison with visible ceiling beams. Thus, Image B's aquatic scene replaces the indoor setting with beams.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Is the white, hand-textured stucco wall visible on the left side of the image, showing irregular surface imperfections and subtle brushwork marks?",
    "explanation": "Image B's depiction of an ocean scene with a jellyfish doesn't feature any walls, stucco or otherwise. Instead, it highlights underwater elements like the water's surface and marine life. The original Image A showcases a room setting with a visible hand-textured wall with imperfections, but this is absent in the oceanic scene of Image B.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the shadow pattern on the ceiling and wall composed of a radial, star-shaped lattice formed by the lantern’s cut-out design, matching the exact geometric configuration of the lantern’s panels?",
    "explanation": "In the edited Image B, instead of shadow patterns from a light fixture, there is underwater lighting often characteristic of marine life, such as luminescent features from a jellyfish. Without associated shadows from a structured object like a lantern, Image B lacks the radial, geometric shadow pattern described in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the corner where the white wall meets the wooden ceiling clearly visible, forming a sharp right-angle edge at the upper left portion of the image?",
    "explanation": "The natural aquatic setting in Image B does not contain fixed architectural structures like walls or ceilings, which would form such angles. Instead, common sense suggests an open sea environment. Therefore, there's no sharp right-angle edge as depicted in the architectural setting of Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the metal chain, consisting of small linked rings, visibly connecting the top of the lantern to the ceiling fixture?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a jellyfish in a fluid aquatic environment, devoid of man-made objects like a metal chain connecting lanterns. The Edited image's natural context abandons specifics of any structured lighting fixture connections as seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the light emanate from within the central chamber of the lantern, creating a bright focal point that radiates outward through the perforated panels?",
    "explanation": "The jellyfish depiction in Image B exhibits bioluminescent properties commonly associated with such marine life, providing the appearance of an internal glow. However, this is distinct from the lantern's central chamber illumination seen in Image A. Image B's light emanation reflects natural marine luminescent biology, not the focal light dispersal through lantern panels.",
    "answer": "No"
