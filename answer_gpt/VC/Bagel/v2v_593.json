      "question": "Does the Funko Pop figure retain the large hind legs characteristic of a kangaroo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Funko Pop figure is analyzed based on its stylized representation of a kangaroo. It features disproportionally large feet which are typical of a kangaroo's hind legs, albeit in a chibi and exaggerated style. This suggests a stylization that maintains the essence of large hind legs, albeit not to scale compared to a real kangaroo.",

      "question": "Is the long tail of the kangaroo preserved in the Funko Pop figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the visual analysis of Image B, the Funko Pop figure includes a notable long tail, an important characteristic of kangaroos. This is consistent with the recognizable feature of the kangaroo anatomy, used for balance.",

      "question": "Does the chibi-style kangaroo figure inside the box include a pouch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing the boxed chibi-style figure in Image B, there is no visible outline or feature that resembles a pouch, which is a distinct feature of female kangaroos. The simplified and compact design does not include this element.",

      "question": "Is the Funko Pop figure primarily colored brown to reflect the original kangaroo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the Funko Pop figure is predominantly brown, which aligns with the typical coloring of a real kangaroo's fur. This maintains continuity in coloration, reflecting the original animal's natural appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the hopping-related elements (hind legs and tail) depicted in the chibi-style figure inside the box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the examination of the boxed figure in Image B, both hind legs and a tail are visibly included. These elements are integral to the kangaroo's hopping ability and are represented, albeit in a stylized chibi form. This suggests an effort to maintain fundamental characteristics of a kangaroo's anatomy related to its movement.",
