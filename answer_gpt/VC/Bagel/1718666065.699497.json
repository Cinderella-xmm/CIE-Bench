    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there at least one horn present on the forehead of the unicorn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a prominent horn on the unicorn's forehead, which is a defining characteristic of unicorns. This horn is visibly spiraled and distinct from the rest of the head, clearly showing that it is present.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the subject have four legs arranged in a horse-like stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the unicorn is depicted with all four legs, arranged in a manner typical of a horse. This stance is common for quadrupeds, providing stability and balance.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the unicorn positioned in a three-quarter view facing toward the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn is positioned facing slightly to the left side of the image rather than the right. The angle of the body and head suggests that it is more of a profile view than a three-quarter view toward the right.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible dark, oval-shaped eye on the side of the unicorn's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The unicorn in Image B has a stylized curl for an eye, not a dark, oval-shaped one. The eye lacks the typical depth and coloring that would make it clearly visible as dark and oval-shaped.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the unicorn's head slightly turned toward the viewer, showing part of the left side of the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn's head is turned slightly toward the left of the viewer, allowing some visibility of the left side of its face. This positioning suggests engagement with the viewer.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the unicorn have a broad, muscular body with a high-set head and arched neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn's body is smoothly stylized and lacks the specific muscle definition typical of realistic equine bodies. The neck is not notably arched; it appears more straight and aligned with the sculpture's stylized aesthetic.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the front legs positioned slightly forward, with the back legs supporting the body's weight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn's legs are positioned in a regular standing posture, with no front legs noticeably extended forward in a stepping or dynamic stance, nor is there an indication of the back legs bearing more weight.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
