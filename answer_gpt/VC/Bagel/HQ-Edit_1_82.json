      "question": "Is the “GIOROUR” logo clearly visible on the balance beam?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, what appears recognizable as a logo is present on the balance beam the three figures are balancing on, suggesting attention to brand detail. In Image A, the logo is distinguishable as 'GIOROUR,' capitalizing on brand visibility. When compared, the emphasis of the depiction in Image B might not resonate with the same clarity or detail level as in real-life imagery.",

      "question": "Is the gymnast positioned with both feet firmly on the surface of the balance beam?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the children figuratively representing gymnasts are depicted engaging in acrobatics on a balance beam, with noticeable variance in footing stability; one figure even has just one foot. The focus deviates from reality as seen in Image A, where gymnasts exhibit precision with balanced footing.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Is the blue floor mat visible beneath the balance beam?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, a floor mat’s depiction is limited by the frame of the artwork, which sidesteps the realism of a typical gymnastics setting where a prominent protective mat, as shown beneath the beam in Image A, assures safety.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not provide detailed rendering of external brand logos like GOTS on the supporting structures. Instead, it centers on expressive elements and highlights gymnasts’ presentation, unlike Image A, where precision in every design part, including logos, maintains a realistic layout.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene exclusively focuses on three gymnast-like figures on a single beam, unlike Image A, where there are multiple gymnasts in the wider setting performing distinct routines. The artistic context in B suggests an isolated act, shifting focus to the three figures.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, hair details on each depicted figure vary subtly from realistic styles, emphasizing more on thematic representation than detailed texturing or coloring, unlike the clear styling with practical accessories, such as a red hair tie, in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the balance beam rests on two support structures, replicating physical stability principles visible clearly in Image A, suggesting structural practicality within toy model design conventions or creative interpretations.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Figurative detail in Image B steps away from illustrating a crowded arena atmosphere noticeable with spectators as seen in Image A, opting instead for an art frame narrative emphasizing primary characters over audience scenery.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The artistic interpretation of Image B omits such branding details, focusing more on expressive characters rather than surroundings. In contrast, Image A situates the beam against a specific stadium wall format featuring prominent organizational emblems.",
