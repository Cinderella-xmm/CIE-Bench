    "Question": "Q1: Does the soccer ball retain exactly 12 black pentagonal panels and 20 white hexagonal panels arranged in a spherical configuration?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer ball is illustrated in a comic-style, maintaining the traditional pattern of a soccer ball which typically consists of 12 black pentagonal and 20 white hexagonal panels. The pattern in the edited image suggests the presence of these panels; however, due to the illustration style, these panels are not explicitly counted but assumed based on the common design of soccer balls.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the soccer ball depicted as a three-dimensional sphere with curved surfaces and proper perspective?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer ball is depicted in a comic-style which often uses outlines and shading to imply three-dimensionality. Although the illustration is not photorealistic, the ball's shape and the shading are intended to give the impression of a 3D sphere, with a visible curvature.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the goalpost maintain a rectangular frame with two vertical posts and one horizontal crossbar forming a standard goal shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the goalpost is illustrated with two vertical posts and a horizontal crossbar, forming a rectangle, which is the standard shape of a football goal. The drawing style uses thick lines to convey these elements of the goalpost.",
