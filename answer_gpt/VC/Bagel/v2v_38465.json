      "question": "Is the sunset visible on the horizon with its reflection on the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunset is clearly visible on the horizon, with the sun positioned at the center. The reflection of the sun is evident on the water's surface, casting a bright line across the ocean, which is a common optical effect when observing sunsets over bodies of water. This observation aligns with the expected natural phenomena, suggesting the presence of a sunset on the horizon.",

      "question": "Does the sandy beach retain its texture and extend across the bottom of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a sandy beach at the bottom, consistent with the texture and appearance one would expect from sand. It stretches across the bottom of the image, forming the ground on which the figures stand. The visual texture and continuity in the image indicate that the sandy beach is preserved.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ocean waves present, showing natural movement near the shore?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of ocean waves is visible, with the water appearing to be moving towards the shore. This provides a sense of dynamic ocean movement, characteristic of waves nearing a shoreline. The visual cue of the wave movement suggests a natural interaction between the water and the beach.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the surfboards retain their original colors (yellow on the left, red and teal on the right) and upright positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the surfboards in upright positions. The surfboard on the left retains its yellow color, and the board on the right exhibits red and teal colors. These color attributes and their positions align with what is expected from their real-world counterparts, suggesting retention of their original appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the pandas positioned similarly to the original humans, with one arm holding the surfboard and both facing the sunset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the panda-headed figures imitate the posture of humans. Each figure has one arm holding their respective surfboard, and both are oriented towards the sunset, mirroring the stance and orientation of the figures in Image A. This alignment indicates a similarity in positioning and action between the pandas and the original humans.",
