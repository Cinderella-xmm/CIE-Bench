      "question": "Is the background composed of flowing, curved lines made of multicolored bokeh lights in red, orange, blue, purple, and teal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of flowing, curved lines, but they are stylized with solid colors and smooth textures rather than multicolored bokeh lights. The visible colors include shades of blue, pink, and orange. This contrasts with Image A, where the colors appear as blurred bokeh lights across a dark background.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the beige coat retain a visible woolen texture with detailed folds and surface variation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the coat appears smooth and uniform without the visible woolen texture and surface variations typical of fabric. Unlike Image A, where the coat shows realistic texture variations and folds consistent with woolen material, the edited image simplifies these details into a clean and cartoon-like appearance.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the dark scarf adorned with a visible, subtle patterned texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scarf does not showcase subtle patterned textures. It appears uniformly colored and smooth in texture, emphasizing a simplified representation typical of stylistic illustrations. In contrast, Image A displays textured patterns that are consistent with real fabric appearances.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sunglasses in Image B are present, but they appear more stylized than in Image A and maintain a consistent position over the eyes, matching their placement in the original. Despite the stylized transformation, their positioning remains accurate over the face.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the character stylized with silver-gray hair, rendered in a smooth and simplified form without waviness but capturing similar color attributes to those found in Image A. The hair in Image A appears natural and wavy, whereas Image B gives it a cartoonish, solid appearance.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two buttons are visible on the front of the coat, consistent with the number and placement from Image A. Despite the coat's transformation to a stylized form, this detail is retained accurately.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the scarf positioned under the coat collar, creating a layered effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scarf in Image B is depicted neatly underneath the coat collar, creating a layered appearance. This arrangement continues from Image A, maintaining the casual yet organized layering evidence in the original representation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the coat's lapels and collar with a structured, angular shape, similar to Image A but more simplified. This stylized portrayal keeps the edges defined and maintains the signature form seen in standard coat designs.",
