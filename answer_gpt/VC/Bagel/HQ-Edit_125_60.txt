    "Question": "Q3: Is the wooden table surface with visible grain, cracks, and natural wear present beneath the tagine and ingredients?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the artwork features a floating urn with smoke and ethereal effects, not depicting a wooden table surface. Image A's setting with a tangible table surface showing grain and wear is replaced, thus the described table is not present.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the textured, earth-toned wall in the background visible, showing subtle discoloration and uneven surface?",
