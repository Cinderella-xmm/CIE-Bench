      "question": "Does the sparrow retain its distinct brown, white, and black feather patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow displays typical feather colors characteristic of a house sparrow: brown, white, and black. These colors are arranged in the usual pattern found on sparrows. This observation is consistent with realistic representations of sparrows in the real world. Therefore, the color pattern remains similar to what is typically seen in such birds.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the sparrow's beak shape and size consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beak of the sparrow appears slightly more stylized and larger in proportion compared to a typical house sparrow due to its cartoonish style. Analyzing Image A, the sparrow has a more realistic, well-proportioned beak. By comparing both images, the beak in Image B appears exaggerated, leading to the conclusion that it is not consistent with the original image.",

      "question": "Is the sparrow still perched on the top rail of the chair in the same upright posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow maintains an upright posture and is perched on the top rail of the chair. This posture mirrors that typically observed in small birds, demonstrating balance and alertness. Image A also shows the sparrow perched in a similar manner. The comparison shows consistency in the posture between both images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the chair retain its simple design with vertical slats and horizontal rails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chair has a straightforward design with vertical slats and horizontal rails, indicative of a simple wooden chair structure. Comparing this to Image A, which showcases the same structural elements, confirms the edited image retains the fundamental design of the chair.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sparrow's feet visibly gripping the chair's top rail as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow is positioned such that its feet are visible, gripping the top rail of the chair, maintaining physiological accuracy of bird perching behavior. Image A depicts the sparrow with a similar grip on the chair's rail. The consistencies in both images verify that the sparrow's feet maintain their function and appearance.",
