      "question": "Is the cocktail liquid pale yellow in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the liquid inside the cartoon cocktail glass is distinctly pale yellow. This is evident from the bright yellow hues used to depict the liquid in the illustration. Normally, a cocktail like a margarita might have a similar color, which aligns with the depiction here. Therefore, the image clearly shows the pale yellow liquid, matching the description.",

      "question": "Does the lime wedge have a bright green outer rind and visible segmented interior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lime wedge is illustrated with a green rind and a segmented interior in shades of lighter green. This is how lime wedges typically appear, with a rind that is brighter than its inner flesh, which is segmented due to the nature of citrus fruits. The depiction is consistent with how a lime wedge usually looks.",

      "question": "Is the rim of the glass coated with a speckled mixture of white and red granules?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rim of the glass is shown covered with what appears to be granules that are colored in pink. Typically, cocktail glasses might have rims dipped in salt or sugar mixed with spices for flavor or garnish, usually appearing as speckled granules. However, the illustration uses a uniform pink color without showing individual white and red granules. Thus, it does not match the description.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there multiple translucent, angular ice cubes visible inside the glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon representation shows several angular blocks within the glass that resemble ice cubes. The ice cubes are translucent, as indicated by their light blue color and clear edges, which denote transparency and angular shape. This matches the criteria for being multiple translucent, angular ice cubes.",

      "question": "Is the glass placed on a dark blue surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the context of Image B, the background does not support the idea of a dark blue surface. Instead, the environment is a festive illustration, with blue used in the background for overall ambiance rather than indicating a surface. Therefore, the glass is not placed on a dark blue surface but rather appears amidst a colorful party-themed backdrop.",
