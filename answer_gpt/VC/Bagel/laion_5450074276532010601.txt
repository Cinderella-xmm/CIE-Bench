    "Question": "Q2: Are the paddles clearly depicted with one red rubber surface and one blue rubber surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the paddles are visually designed as characters and are depicted with colored surfaces: the left paddle has a red surface and the right paddle has a blue surface, aligning with the theme of creating distinct character-like objects.

    "Question": "Q3: Is there a diamond-shaped logo present on the handle of each paddle?",
    "explanation": "Image B focuses on an imaginative and playful depiction of ping pong paddles with faces and expressions, rather than detailed logos or branding.

}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are exactly two paddles included in the set?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, only two distinct paddles are featured alongside vivid expressions and the adventurous theme, thus visually indicating a set of two within the depiction. This aligns with the usual representation of paddles for a standard game setup in such artistic contexts.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is a rope handle visibly attached to the left side of the box?",
    "explanation": "There is no box shown in Image B; instead, the ping pong paddles are placed inside a treasure chest, enhancing the theme of adventure. A treasure chest typically doesn't have rope handles in a classical sense within illustrations, hence no rope handle is depicted.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a horizontal partition inside the box that separates and holds the paddles?",
    "explanation": "The setup in Image B is more akin to a treasure chest scene where the paddles are part of a lively, imaginative arrangement. Such a playful representation doesn't fixate on practical packaging elements like a horizontal partition, which doesn't exist in this context.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the box have a rectangular shape with a hinged lid that opens upward?",
    "explanation": "The structure in Image B is visually a treasure chest, with specific stylistic features more suited to a box that opens with a single, top lid. Its design greatly differs from a standard, practical box with exact rectangularity and hinges. The hinged lid concept is transplanted to imply a treasure chest opening.",
    "answer": "No"
