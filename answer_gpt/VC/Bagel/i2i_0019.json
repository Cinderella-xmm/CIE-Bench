      "question": "Does the figurine retain the elephant's large ears and trunk as part of its general silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine is clearly designed to resemble an elephant in a stylized form. The figurine's prominent features include large ears and a long trunk, which are iconic parts of an elephant's silhouette. This design is typical for representations of elephants, especially in playful or stylized forms like figurines or toys. World knowledge tells us that elephants are often characterized by their large ears and trunks, and these are important features in identifying the animal.",

      "question": "Is the chibi figurine depicted holding grass with its trunk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine is shown with its trunk positioned around some grass, mimicking a common activity of elephants who use their trunks to grab and hold food. The presence of grass being held by the figurine's trunk is a direct indication of this association, derived from common knowledge of elephant behavior.",

      "question": "Does the figurine's surface include a subtle representation of the elephant's wrinkled skin texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine has a smooth surface typical for plastic or resin figurines, which typically do not feature detailed texturing like wrinkles due to manufacturing limitations or artistic choice. In contrast, Image A shows a real elephant with clearly visible skin wrinkles. Comparing this information validates that the figurine lacks a wrinkled texture.",

      "question": "Does the figurine maintain the elephantâ€™s grey body color and brownish ear tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine is predominantly grey which is a typical representation of an elephant's natural skin color. Additionally, the ears have a brownish tone similar to the original elephant in Image A. Elephants generally have a grey skin with varying tones, and their ears can have different shades based on lighting and environment. This is accurately reflected in the figurine.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the base of the figurine which has the text 'JUNGLE FRIEND' clearly engraved onto it. The positioning and style of the engraving on the base is typical of many decorative figurines which often have messages or titles on them. Comparing adds no new information as this is not present in Image A.",
