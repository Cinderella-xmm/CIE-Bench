      "question": "Is the turquoise-colored, ribbed dome with a golden finial present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a dome structure that appears to be turquoise-colored similar to Image A. However, it does not feature a ribbed design; instead, it has a smooth surface. Therefore, although a turquoise dome is present, its design is different.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are blue mosaic tiles visible on the structure. The patterns include floral and geometric designs, similar to those in Image A. The presence of these tiles suggests a consistent design element between both images.",

        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any tall cylindrical minaret structure nor any patterned band that would be associated with such a minaret. The image depicts a miniature or decorative model of architecture missing such elements.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dome is centrally positioned behind the entrance archway which resembles an iwan, yet there is no minaret visible on the left side of the structure. The layout is simplified in this model depiction without additional structures.",
