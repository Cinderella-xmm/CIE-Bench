        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain features a character with a yellow body. The majority of the character, including its body and the head, is yellow, which is consistent with the typical coloring of the Psyduck character from Pokémon. Combining this observation with common visual interpretation of colors, the character is predominantly yellow. Therefore, the keychain maintains the character's original color scheme.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the keychain having a character with a distinctly large and flat bill, resembling that of a duck, which is a signature feature of Psyduck from Pokémon. This visual characteristic aligns with knowledge of Psyduck's appearance. Thus, the keychain retains the large, flat duck-like bill of the character.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character on the keychain is depicted with wide eyes and an expression that appears to be puzzled or confused, commonly associated with Psyduck's typical look in Pokémon media. The eyes are large and rounded, contributing to this appearance. Therefore, the keychain version maintains the characteristic wide-eyed and puzzled expression.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the character on the keychain does not possess small triangular ears on its head. Instead, it has dark lines on top of its head, which can be visually interpreted as hair or another feature. Common knowledge of Psyduck, the character involved, affirms it does not have small triangular ears, thus the keychain reflects this accurately.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character featured on the keychain exhibits a rounded body shape that is consistent with the typical form of Psyduck from Pokémon. The overall shape is bulbous and lacks pronounced angles, contributing to a rounded appearance. Therefore, the keychain version retains this characteristic shape.",
