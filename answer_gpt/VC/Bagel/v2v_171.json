      "question": "Are the child’s eyes almond-shaped with dark brown irises and a visible light reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the character's eyes are depicted as large, round black dots typical for chibi or stylized characters, which do not indicate almond-shaped eyes, brown irises, or visible light reflection as seen in realistic depictions. Therefore, the answer is derived from the stylized representation of the chibi character where iris color and shape details cannot be discerned.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the child’s hair light brown and styled in a low ponytail with loose strands around the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character has hair represented in a clean, stylized manner usually found in figurines. The character's hair is tied back but doesn't show loose strands around the face typical of a realistic depiction. It is placed in a large bun rather than a low ponytail, based on conventional stylization in figurine models.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the child wear a short-sleeved, rust-colored t-shirt with a round neckline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character wearing a rust-colored t-shirt with a round neckline, consistent with the description. Figurines often retain the same distinct apparel colors and styles as their real-life counterparts.",

      "question": "Are the child’s pants blue denim jeans?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show the character wearing blue pants that can be associated with denim jeans; they appear in the typical coloring and style. Figurines tend to carry over these basic clothing characteristics to maintain detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character is depicted sitting cross-legged with the hands positioned in a way that suggests holding an object rather than clasped between knees. This posture difference reflects the design choice in stylized figurines.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B is holding a device, and due to the stylized nature, doesn't show gaze direction as clearly as the original image might suggest. The toy-like representation does not include detailed directionality of the gaze.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a black tablet placed on a small wooden table in front of the child?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the original setup isn't seen, the character is holding a device similar to a tablet. A small wooden table is present as part of the figurine packaging backdrop, but not the black tablet separately placed. Stylized product displays tend to incorporate details to enhance thematic packaging.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine depicted in Image B is barefoot, which matches the initial imagery of real-life barefoot presentation, consistent with typical chibi and figurine designs meant to mimic character properties.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The table and any flooring depicted in Image B don't offer detailed grain patterns due to the stylized nature of figurine packaging where these finer details are generally abstracted or simplified.",
