      "question": "Is the white star with the number \"4\" visible on the turret of the tank?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tank has been edited to appear as a LEGO-like structure and the surface details, including inscriptions, are replaced with colorful LEGO bricks. Therefore, markings such as the white star and number '4' are not present in this version of the tank.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tank is covered and recreated with LEGO-like bricks, which means that detailed markings present on tanks, such as '31 64A' and 'A-14', are not visible.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main gun barrel of the tank, which is part of classic tank designs, is represented in a LEGO style. From the visual depiction, it still seems to be oriented straight forward from the structure that resembles the turret.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sign next to the edited tank in Image B remains unchanged in its wording and design from Image A. Thus, it is visible and legible, containing the same text and imagery.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a colorful representation of the tiger motif is maintained but with LEGO elements and placed in the same area on the tank's front hull, replacing the original painting. This depiction aligns with the edited theme.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
