    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the car retain the distinctive angular LED headlights and central grille intake characteristic of the McLaren 720S?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the car within a display case, maintaining the general shape and features like angular LED headlights and a central grille intake that are associated with the McLaren 720S. These features serve a definitive visual cue that helps identify this model.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the road still a curved two-lane highway with continuous double yellow lines running down its center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting is a diorama, and the focus on the road is limited. However, it suggests a semblance of a road design, but lacks the detailed depiction of double yellow lines commonly found on highways.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the left-hand hillside still present with its reddish-brown slopes and scattered autumnal vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backdrop mimics a hillside with similar coloring and texture but does not explicitly show vegetation as vividly as in Image A, due to the display's more artistic representation rather than realistic detail.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a concrete guardrail along the right side of the road, separating it from the ocean?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) presents a stylized diorama that does not clearly display a concrete guardrail feature. This aspect of the original road layout is not prominently visible in Image B's diorama representation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the car positioned centrally on the right side of the road, facing forward toward the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car is positioned within a diorama case. Despite the limited view of the road or horizon, the car retains a forward-facing orientation within the display, similar to the setup in Image A, but not on a recognizable road.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are rocky outcrops visible in the distant sea, with mist or spray rising near the shore?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ocean scene is part of a backdrop of the diorama and does not highlight specific details like mist or rocky outcrops convincingly due to the stylized nature of the representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the red racing seats with black accents visible through the windshield inside the car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image B shows the car in a diorama format, and the details through the windshield, like the red racing seats with black accents, are retained and clearly visible, much like Image A.",
