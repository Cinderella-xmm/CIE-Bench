    {

      "question": "Are the silhouetted tree branches in the foreground clearly visible and retaining their original shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area where the silhouetted tree branches appear is visible. However, the introduction of a large fictional creature seems to obscure or alter some of the branches. Comparing this with Image A, where these branches are clear and unobstructed, shows the difference in visibility and positioning due to the creature's presence. Therefore, the branches do not retain their original shape and position in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the small green hilltop with sparse vegetation visible just above the mist layer in the mid-ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mid-ground shows a significant portion of the fictional creature, with its features overlapping the area where the hilltop would have been visible. While some vegetation might still be observed, it is largely obscured by the creature. Comparing this to Image A, where the hilltop is clear above the mist, confirms that it is not as visible in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sky retain its original gradient from deep blue at the top to soft pink and lavender near the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although a large creature dominates much of the scene, it does not obscure the sky significantly. The gradient from deep blue to pinks and lavenders near the horizon remains visible, as seen in Image A. Thus, the sky retains its original gradient.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a continuous layer of mist or fog extending horizontally beneath the mountain, obscuring its lower slopes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature's presence adds new visual elements, yet the mist or fog layer appears to remain beneath the creature and mountain. Comparing this with Image A, where the mist is a consistent feature, suggests that this continuity is still present in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the foreground trees, mid-ground hill, and background mountain arranged in their original relative positions, maintaining the depth of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B introduces a large creature which alters the mid-ground extensively. While the foreground and background might still maintain relative positions, the creature dramatically changes the spatial depth and position arrangement seen in Image A, disrupting the original layering.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the tree branches retain their original fine details, including individual twigs and leaf clusters, in silhouette form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while some parts of the silhouetted branches are visible, the introduction of the creature obscures or alters certain areas. Comparing this with Image A, where the branches and details are clear, shows a loss of fine detail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the peak of the mountain still positioned at the highest point in the scene, serving as the central focal point?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fictional creature is positioned prominently and appears taller than the mountain. Comparing this to Image A, where the mountain peak is the highest and central point, the creature in Image B overtakes that role, making the mountain no longer the central focal point.",
