      "question": "Is the pink flamingo-shaped mug with a white beak and curved neck present in the same position relative to the cereal bars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a prominent pink flamingo mug with a curved neck and a white beak. While the specific position in relation to the cereal bars isn't as clear as in Image A due to the illustrated nature of Image B, the visual depiction suggests it's in a similar position. Given the cartoon adaptation of the scene, the relative position is maintained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the words \"freee\" and \"corn flakes\" visible on the cereal box, along with the bird logo above the brand name?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cereal box is illustrated with abstract text and design to resemble a cereal box rather than an exact replica of the brand appearing in Image A. The actual words 'freee' and 'corn flakes' and the bird logo are not distinctly visible. Instead, there are generic markings and text to mimic a cereal box.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the circular illustration of a bowl filled with corn flakes visible on the front of the cereal box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a cereal box with an illustration that appears to mimic a cereal design, showing a bowl with cereal. However, itâ€™s more of a symbolic representation than an identical circular illustration found in Image A, making it visually consistent in theme but not in exact detail.",
      "weight": 2,

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the light-colored wooden surface visible beneath the cereal bars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is an illustration, so the detailed textures like a light-colored wooden surface are not distinctly depicted in the same way as in Image A. The cereal bars appear on a plain surface, which in cartoon style suggests a generic tabletop, but not specifically showing wooden texture or color.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the off-white wall visible in the background behind the cereal box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a solid color typical of illustrative designs that do not aim to replicate specific wall colors or textures found in Image A, which has an off-white wall. Thus, the specific detailing of an off-white wall is not present in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the pink flamingo mug positioned behind the cereal bars and to the left side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flamingo mug is clearly depicted behind the cereal bars and to the left side of the frame, maintaining the spatial organization seen in Image A. This suggests a consistent spatial arrangement between the two images.",
