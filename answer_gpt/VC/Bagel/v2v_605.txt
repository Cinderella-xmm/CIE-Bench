    "Question": "Q1: Is the gorilla depicted with predominantly dark gray to black fur?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the figure is a stylized toy representation labeled as a 'Jungle King.' The toy has dark fur, but given its stylized nature, it mimics the appearance of a gorilla with predominantly dark gray to black fur, following common color choices for such characters in popular culture. Thus, combining this visual cue with world knowledge about toy designs, which often reproduce a character's real-world counterpart colors for authenticity, the answer leans towards a depiction in dark fur.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the gorilla have dark, almost black skin on its face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the toy resembles a cartoonish gorilla wearing jungle-themed accessories. The facial skin is not depicted as a realistic dark, almost black color but rather in a lighter, stylized manner with simplified features. Toy design often prioritizes exaggerated traits for visual appeal, not realism, hence the face having darker, but not almost black skin.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the gorilla shown with a broad, muscular chest and visible pectoral definition?",
    "explanation": "The 'Jungle King' toy in Image B, while muscular and broad in design typical to stylized figures, does not show realistic pectoral definition. It's meant to evoke strength through simple shapes often seen in toy versions of powerful characters but lacks true anatomical detail. Thus, considering the toy's visual style and common toy design practices, muscular cues are present but not detailed.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is there a lighter-colored area on the gorilla’s back and shoulders, indicative of a silverback?",
    "explanation": "In examining Image B, the toy features consistent coloring across its back and shoulders without any lighter areas typical of a silverback gorilla. Toys usually maintain uniformity in color to simplify production and maintain stylized aesthetics. Hence, there are no lighter areas on these sections that suggest a silverback.",

    "Question": "Q5: Does the gorilla have a broad, flat nose and prominent brow ridges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the toy's face captures gorilla-like features with simplified design, having a broad nose and prominent faux brow ridges, common in stylized representations to emphasize distinctive gorilla traits. The toy mimics real gorilla features through exaggerated shapes typical of such products, aligning well with the depiction of these features.",

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the gorilla’s hands placed on its chest in a dominant stance?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents the toy holding an object, not exhibiting typical dominant stance features like placing hands on the chest. A dominant stance involves gestural energy indicating strength through posture, not evident in the toy as it holds accessories more typical of playful, adventurous themes. The hands aren't in the described posture, based on toy design choices.",
    "answer": "No"
