      "question": "Does the edited image retain the specific black spots and white markings on the butterfly's wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is represented in a pixelated, block-like 3D model which significantly alters its detailing and adds a digital aesthetic. While the butterfly's wings in Image A show a specific pattern of black spots and white markings, Image B modifies this with blocks that don't replicate the intricacies of the original spots and markings. The visual information shows a completely different pattern than the realistic ones in the original image.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the fuzzy texture of the butterfly's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a block-style, digital depiction of the butterfly, characterized by sharp edges and flat surfaces, typical of pixelated digital art. This transformation means that any original textures, like the fuzzy appearance of the butterfly's body in Image A, are lost because the digital form does not support such textures.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the butterfly still positioned on the wooden surface in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a series of block-like structures in grayscale, inconsistent with any natural wood grain or color. Image A clearly shows the butterfly on a wooden surface with visible wooden texture and color, while Image B replaces this with an entirely different backdrop, losing the wooden context.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the detailed texture of the butterfly's wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B represents the butterfly's wings in a pixelated format with simple, bold colors and flat surfaces devoid of any intricate detailing seen in Image A. The original image features realistic textures, demonstrating a soft and detailed pattern, which the edited digital creation does not capture due to its stylistic, simplified portrayal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the specific arrangement of spots on the butterfly's wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the general color division of wings into different segments remains, it is executed in a simplified and abstract way that deviates from the specific and natural arrangement of spots found in Image A. The block-like and reduced color usage in the edited image significantly alters the representation of spots.",
