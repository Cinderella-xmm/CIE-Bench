      "question": "Does the image retain the golden-brown bun with its soft texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandwich is topped with a bun that exhibits a golden-brown color and appears to have a soft texture. The bun's visual cues, such as the coloration and lack of visible crusty hardness, suggest it remains soft. The comparison with Image A confirms the bun has been retained without alterations.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the sandwich placed on a white plate, similar to the setup in Image A. The translucent white appearance and circular shape next to the sandwich confirm its presence and retention in both images.",

      "question": "Are the fresh lettuce leaves still present beneath the meat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays fresh green lettuce leaves beneath the pieces of meat within the sandwich. These leaves have a crisp, vibrant appearance which suggests they are fresh. Comparison with Image A, which also features lettuce leaves in the sandwich, shows that they remain unchanged.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, slices of turkey breast are visible, folded securely in the sandwich. Their light beige color and smooth surface indicate they are turkey meats similar to what can be seen in Image A. Hence, the turkey breast slices are retained in the edited image.",
