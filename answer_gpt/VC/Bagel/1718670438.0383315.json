      "question": "Does the robot retain its dome-shaped head with three evenly spaced circular porthole eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's head is dome-shaped with porthole eyes, but the number of eyes and their spacing is a key point. Here, the head has only two circular porthole eyes, not three, and they are not evenly spaced. In contrast, a typical design with three evenly spaced eyes would provide a symmetric look. Therefore, the arrangement doesn't match the description.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the transparent chest panel still present, clearly displaying the internal gear system?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's chest area indeed has a transparent panel. Through this panel, some of the internal gears are visible, which aligns with the description of displaying the internal gear system.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do both arms retain their segmented, piston-style joint construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's arms appear to be constructed with segmented joints, resembling a piston-type structure. This is a characteristic often used in mechanical joints to allow movement, indicating that both arms indeed maintain this style.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both feet equipped with exactly five claw-like toes each?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's feet are not clearly visible with five claw-like toes. Instead, they appear as solid bases without distinct toes, contrasting with the description of having five claws on each foot. Therefore, the feet structure does not match the description.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there five distinct spires and antennae on top of the robot’s head, including one central and four lateral ones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the robot’s head shows spires and antennae, but they do not add up to five. Additionally, there's a visible clock fixture on the head that isn't part of a spire or antenna setup. The arrangement does not display a clear central one with four around it. Thus, the description does not perfectly align.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are multiple interlocking gears of different sizes visible through the transparent chest panel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transparent chest panel of the robot displays gears of varying sizes, which are interlocking, as seen through the transparent panel. This matches the description of visible multiple gears.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the robot maintain its original oxidized bronze and copper color scheme with visible wear and aging effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's color scheme predominantly includes bronze and copper tones, and there are some wear indicators and aged effects present, which suggest oxidation. These colors and textures match the description given.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are the rivets and mechanical fasteners visible along the joints and edges of the robot’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, features such as rivets and mechanical fasteners are not prominently highlighted along the robot's joints and edges as one might expect with a clear mechanical design. The intricate detailing, such as visible rivets, intended for mechanical bonding, does not appear distinctly.",
