    "Question": "Q2: Does the cat have greenish-blue eyes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cat on the throne has eyes that appear more reflective and glassy, giving off a blueish hue.

    "Question": "Q5: Is the cat’s tail curled along the left side of the settee?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no settee visible, as the cat is seated on a throne. The setup does not include a visible tail because the throne obscures any potential view of a tail being curled. Thus, the answer is no.",
