      "question": "Is the girl’s long dark hair with bangs present and extending past her shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette shows the outline of the girl's head with hair that appears smooth and extends downward, likely suggesting long hair. However, due to the black and white nature of the silhouette, it's difficult to confirm if bangs are visible or if the hair color is dark. Commonly, silhouettes indicate the shape but lack specific details such as color. Therefore, while long hair is suggested by the outline, other characteristics cannot be confirmed by the silhouette alone.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the lace trim on the blouse as prominent elements within the silhouette design. The lace is illustrated with definite texture and pattern distinct from the rest of the blouse, indicating its presence at the cuffs and collar, which is consistent with traditional lace designs known for being visually intricate.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skirt is shown as part of the silhouette as a substantial portion extending from the waist downward. The pleated aspect is depicted similarly, with folds or layers, traditional in pleated skirts. The silhouette effectively communicates this garment style through the design and flow, confirming the pleated skirt.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette clearly positions the violin beneath the chin area and shows the left hand actively holding the neck of the violin, indicative of the common posture when a musician is preparing to play. This setup aligns with standard techniques for violin playing.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not provide information on the background or environmental lighting. The silhouette format focuses entirely on the foreground subject without showing the setting. Therefore, there is no visible evidence in the silhouette to make conclusions about any background windows or lighting effects.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible objects such as a candlestick or table depicted, as it primarily focuses on the silhouette of the girl with the violin. The lack of detailed background elements like furniture or additional items confirms no such features are illustrated.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silhouette in Image B doesn't convey expressions or gaze direction due to the nature of silhouette representation. While her head's angle could suggest downward focus, the expression is not discernible in silhouette art because it lacks facial details.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silhouette in Image B highlights the lace patterns at the cuffs and collar with distinctive visual representation, making the textured lace a notable element in the design.
