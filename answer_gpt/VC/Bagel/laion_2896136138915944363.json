    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the stylized illustration retain the scalloped pattern on the wings and back, with alternating dark and light feather edges forming a scale-like texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized illustration on the box features a bird with intricate feather patterns on its wings and back. The alternating dark and light edges give the appearance of a scale-like texture, similar to those often seen in realistic stylized bird illustrations. This suggests attention to detail in capturing the texture of the feathers.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the breast and throat area rendered in a consistent peach-orange hue, distinct from the darker upper body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stylized bird illustration in Image B shows a clear distinction between the peach-orange hue of the breast and throat area and the darker, more textured appearance of the upper body. This is a common technique in illustrated designs to emphasize the natural variance in bird plumage coloring.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the beak long, straight, and uniformly black, extending from the face without curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the bird's beak is depicted as long and straight, with a consistent black coloration. Such detail in illustration indicates the artist's effort to maintain realistic features that are typically observed in shorebirds.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's eye is prominently featured as a dark circle, which is positioned close to the center of the head and is surrounded by lighter coloring. This is a stylization method to emphasize the eye while maintaining realistic anatomy.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the bird's legs portrayed as dark gray-black, ending in visible claws on three forward-facing toes. This depiction is typical for shorebirds and carefully presented in the stylized illustration.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite being a stylized illustration on packaging, the bird is depicted in a standing posture with extended legs and an upright body, suggesting it is positioned as if on a shoreline. Such a pose is commonly used to reflect natural bird behavior.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there small tufts of beach grass and scattered pebbles visible in the foreground beneath the birdâ€™s feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any foreground elements such as beach grass or pebbles beneath the bird's feet. The background of the bird illustration on the packaging lacks these specific details and focuses instead on a more abstract representation.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the bird with a clear transition from the warm peach-orange underparts to a darker, mottled appearance on the upper body and wings. This transition is a hallmark of realistic bird illustrations, effectively distinguishing different plumage sections.",
