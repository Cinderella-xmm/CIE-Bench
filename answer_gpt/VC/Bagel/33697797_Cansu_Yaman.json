      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a fantastical scene with fictional colorful characters and vegetation, creating a dreamlike environment typical of a digital art style. The image focuses on vibrant colors and whimsical elements, lacking any realistic architectural features like a gray stone-paved floor. Considering this and typical grey stone pavement consistency, it is clear such a feature is not present.",
