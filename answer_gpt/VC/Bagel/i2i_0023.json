      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boy's face is illustrated in a cartoon style. Cartoon depictions often simplify features for expressive purposes, typically showing eyes, nose, and mouth distinctly. In this image, the illustrated boy has eyes, a nose, and a mouth depicted in a simple and standard cartoon format, making them clear and recognizable.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all four birds are illustrated in a simple cartoon style, maintaining their positions similar to Image A.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon depiction retains the decorative aspect of the boy's green T-shirt. The design shows simple graphics consistent with the cartoon style, suggesting that the T-shirt's cartoon print is visible and intact, even if simplified.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the boyâ€™s head visibly larger compared to the shrunken size of the birds in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the style of illustration often exaggerates certain features for effect. The boy's head is proportionally larger than the birds, which tend to be drawn smaller to highlight the boy as the central figure in the artwork. This exaggeration is typical in cartoon styles where head sizes are often emphasized.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a distinct art style commonly used in stickers or simplistic digital illustrations where thick white outlines are used to make figures stand out. This styling cue is present, accentuating the cartoon style by producing a neat and cohesive visual boundary around the entire group of figures.",
