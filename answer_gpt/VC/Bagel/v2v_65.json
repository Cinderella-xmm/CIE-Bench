        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the helmet features two distinct curved horns on either side, but there is no visible central white feather-like adornment. Considering the design and absence of the described feature, it's evident that the adornment is not present.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is seen holding a round shield that has a simplistic design, lacking any visible detailing such as a central boss or rivets. While it's a shield, the level of detailing described is not present.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted inside a snow globe, and there is no sword seen at the back or elsewhere with a visible hilt. The figurine's design within the globe does not include these details.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B does not exhibit intricate details like a swirling Norse-inspired engraved pattern on the shoulder pauldron. Given the stylized nature of the figurine, such engravings are absent.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is designed with minimal detailing due to its stylized, chibi form within a snow globe. There is no visible fur trim along the tunic’s edges, which would typically provide a texture that stands out.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armor does not appear to have a metallic texture or finish. The snow globe's figurine style uses a more matte and simplified texture typical for such models, lacking the sheen associated with metallic finishes.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Image B figurine shows the helmet with horns that are indeed curved outward and upward, symmetrically positioned on either side, which is consistent with typical Viking-inspired designs.",
