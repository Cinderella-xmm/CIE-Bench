    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the three-tiered wooden table structure with horizontal slats and vertical supports still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fairies are working on a table with multiple tiers similar to Image A. The basic structure with horizontal slats and vertical supports is still evident. This suggests continuity of the same table structure across both images.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both the asymmetrical clay vase with a pinched neck and the symmetrical clay vase still present on the upper tier?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original clay vases have been replaced by new clay items being sculpted by the fairies. This indicates that neither the asymmetrical clay vase with a pinched neck nor the symmetrical clay vase from Image A is present in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the flat circular clay piece with a central hole still positioned on the upper tier behind the vases?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show the flat circular clay piece with a central hole visible in Image A. Instead, there are new clay formations being crafted by the fairies, which suggests the original clay piece is no longer present.",
      "weight": 2,

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area where the rectangular block of clay was located is now occupied by different clay objects manipulated by the fairies. Therefore, the rectangular block of gray clay is no longer visible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area previously displaying white fabric scraps in Image A is obscured by the addition of decorative elements like grass and flowers. These changes indicate the fabric scraps are no longer visible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower table as seen in Image A no longer shows the small wooden modeling tool due to the fairy activity and the rearrangement of items, indicating that the tool is absent.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the structures appear to be supported by a flat wooden base. Though Image B adds a decorative glass cover and other elements, the fundamental base supporting the structure remains consistent with Image A.",
