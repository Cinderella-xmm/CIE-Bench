      "question": "Is there a snowboard visible beneath the snowboarder’s feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is displayed snowboarding down a slope, with a snowboard clearly drawn beneath their feet. The snowboard is depicted in a stylized manner consistent with the cartoon style of the image. The shape and position of the snowboard align with what one would expect when snowboarding. Thus, the visual cues confirm the presence of a snowboard.",

      "question": "Are the snowboarder’s boots visibly attached to the snowboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the character's feet are positioned on the snowboard, the stylized nature of the drawing omits detailed bindings that might be used in real-life snowboarding scenarios. Nevertheless, given the cartoon style, the intention seems to be that the boots are indeed attached. Therefore, based on the expectation of visual depiction of boot-to-board attachment, the snowboarder's boots appear attached.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snowboarder is depicted wearing a backpack with clear shoulder straps visible over the character’s shoulders. The straps are drawn in a contrasting color, emphasizing their presence and indicating that the character is carrying a backpack, which is supported by common knowledge about how backpacks are worn.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snowboarder wears an orange-red-colored ski suit with distinct white diagonal stripes running along the legs and torso. The color combination and pattern are clear within the stylized image. This aligns with a common ski suit design often using vibrant colors and visible patterns for style and safety.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snowboarder's face is fully visible, but the cartoon style simplifies the character’s features. The hair is stylized to flow behind the character, suggesting wind movement associated with snowboarding. The specific hair color is not detailed in the illustration due to the cartoon representation, but the depiction of flowing hair fits the description given.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is adorned with stylized illustrations of snow-covered pine trees and mountains. This background scenery is typical in winter sports imagery, reinforcing the setting in a snowy, mountainous environment. The stylized elements like the sharply pointed trees and layered mountain ranges capture the essence of a winter setting.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the snowboarder in a crouched posture that visually suggests movement and balance needed for descending. The forward-leaning stance with slightly bent knees is a common posture for snowboarding downhill, indicating dynamic action typical in such activities, even when rendered in a stylized cartoon format.",
