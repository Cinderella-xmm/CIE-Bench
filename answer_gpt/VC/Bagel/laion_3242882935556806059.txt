    "Question": "Q1: Are the individual flower petals shaped like elongated, recurved lily petals with six distinct segments per bloom?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the petals are shaped more like diamond-like facets as part of a crystal or glass representation, rather than organic flower petals. They are designed with intricate cuts typical of ornamental crystallized objects and do not have the elongated, recurved shape typical of natural lily petals. Hence, the answer is No.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the bouquet arranged in a tightly packed, spherical cluster with multiple flowers overlapping?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of the crystal flowers does not form a tightly packed spherical cluster. Instead, there are gaps between the flowers, revealing their individuality and emphasizing the complexity of each piece through space rather than overlap. Therefore, the answer is No.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a transparent, cylindrical glass vase holding the bouquet?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a clear glass vase holding the bouquet of crystal flowers. Its cylindrical shape is evident, providing a showcase that complements the bouquet without overwhelming it. Thus, the answer is Yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the vase positioned directly beneath the bouquet, with stems/rods extending upward from it?",
    "explanation": "The visual information from Image B shows that the vase is positioned directly beneath the bouquet, and the glass rods (representing stems) extend upward from it, aligning with typical vase arrangements. Therefore, the answer is Yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there approximately ten to twelve flowers visible in the bouquet, including both open blooms and closed buds?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the number of crystallized floral figures visible in the bouquet appears to be around seven or eight, making the count less than ten. This includes open blooms and does not suggest any closed buds due to their ornamental nature. Therefore, the answer is No.",
    "answer": "No"
