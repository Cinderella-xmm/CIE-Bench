      "question": "Is the Olympus brand name visible on the top of the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, analyzing the camera in the woman's hands, the brand name 'OM1' is visible on the camera, which resembles the styling of Olympus cameras but does not explicitly state 'Olympus'. Thus, the direct name is not visible. Image A has the Canon logo, indicating that the camera brand has been changed during the edit.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a large circular lens at the front of the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the camera prominently shows a large circular lens which aligns with the typical design of cameras having a circular lens for capturing images. This design aspect is visually consistent with Image A, which also displays a large circular lens at the front of the camera.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are both hands visibly gripping the camera body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual depiction shows both hands positioned around the camera, suggesting gripping. Art-style differences ensure hands are less detailed than a real photo, but the positioning indicates grip. Image A clearly shows both hands grasping the camera, supporting the conclusion.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is a brown leather strap attached to the camera and extending over the shoulder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not distinctly show a brown leather strap attached to the camera extending over the shoulder as in real life leather camera straps. Confirmation of a strap would require additional leather details or attachment points, not depicted here. Image A distinctly shows a strap, indicating omission in the edited version.",

      "question": "Are there two flap pockets on the front of the denim jacket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jacket design is simplified and does not specifically illustrate two flap pockets as observed in typical denim jacket design elements. Image A accurately displays two flap pockets on the jacket's chest region, indicating they are not depicted due to stylization changes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not visually present vertical ridges or pleats on the white blouse, often visible in fabric texture or design detail. The stylization in the edited version omits such intricate details. Image A clearly shows pleats on the blouse, suggesting a deliberate omission in the edit.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waist area does not clearly depict a brown belt or recognize the silver rectangular buckle, which would typically be highlighted in contrasting colors or reflective materials. Image A displays these details clearly, implying a lack of detail in the edit.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of the camera is illustrated as being held in front of the torso, approximately at chest height, which is consistent with typical camera-holding positions for ease of access. Image A corroborates this positioning, maintaining consistency in depiction.",
