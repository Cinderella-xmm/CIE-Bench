        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is featured with a white coat and a blonde mane and tail. This appearance is consistent with common depictions of horses that have these natural colors. Comparing it to Image A, which shows the same horse with a white coat and a blonde mane and tail, confirms that there has been no change in these features. The consistency in color and texture indicates no alteration in the coat and mane features between Image A and Image B.",

      "question": "Does the horse retain its posture of being in mid-gait?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is shown in mid-gait, indicating it is in motion with one front leg raised and the other slightly bent. Analyzing Image A, the horse is also captured mid-gait in a similar position. This indicates that there is no change in the horse's posture, and it maintains the same mid-gait stance in both images. This posture is typical for a horse in motion and suggests dynamic movement.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's hooves are visible and appear naturally proportioned and placed on the ground, consistent with an active gait. Comparing with Image A, the horse's hooves are similarly depicted. There are no visible alterations like color changes or additional features on the hooves between the two images. Thus, the horse's hooves remain unchanged in their appearance and natural depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse appears with a balanced and proportionate body, maintaining the natural muscle structure typical of horses. Comparing with Image A, the horse is similarly proportioned, with both images showing a strong, muscular form in mid-motion. The consistency in body proportion across both images suggests that there have been no alterations to the horse's body shape or size.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's eyes are lively and alert, consistent with the expression of a horse in motion. The facial features appear natural and unchanged. Upon examining Image A, the horse exhibits the same alert expression and eye detail, with no changes to its facial expression or features. This suggests that there has been no modification to the horse's eyes or facial expression between the images.",
