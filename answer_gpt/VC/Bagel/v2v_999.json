      "question": "Is the bathtub still present with its wooden panel exterior and positioned in the same corner of the bathroom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see a bathtub with a wooden panel exterior positioned in the corner of the bathroom, similar to the setup seen in the original image, Image A. The consistent color and design of the wooden panel suggest that the bathtub's position and exterior remain unchanged. Using knowledge of design consistency, the bathtubâ€™s materials and location are compared across both images to confirm that the position and style match.",

      "question": "Are the tiles on the wall still displaying the same floral pattern as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall tiles have changed from displaying a floral pattern seen in Image A to plain square tiles, losing the decorative elements present in the original. Observing shapes and patterns, the visual cues clearly indicate a switch from patterned to basic tiles, which shows a noticeable change in the wall decor.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the towel rack positioned next to the sink with a beige towel hanging on it, faithfully retaining the setup observed in Image A. This setup uses positioning cues and the color of the towel to confirm the continuity in fixture location alongside the sink from the original to the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the lighting fixture still mounted above the original location of the cabinet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the lighting fixture mounted above the cabinet, as was visible in Image A, suggesting no relocation of the fixture from its original placement above the cabinet's top. By comparing fixture placements and using spatial reasoning with visual evidence, consistency in the lighting position is verified.",

      "question": "Are the new chibi-style Russian nesting dolls placed along the edge of the bathtub, maintaining the spatial arrangement of the original fixtures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Russian nesting dolls are positioned along the edge of the bathtub, introducing a new element that interrupts the spatial arrangement of the original fixtures, yet they are distinctly highlighted in terms of placement. This analysis involves noticing the dolls' positions distinct from the original setup, where no such objects were present, showing a shift in the visual arrangement's focus.",
