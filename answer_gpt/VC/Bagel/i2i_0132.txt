    "Question": "Q2: Does one individual have their arm extended forward, as if throwing the frisbee?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both characters have their arms visible, but neither displays a strong gesture that conveys the act of throwing a frisbee. Instead, both seem to be in a neutral position relative to the frisbee. Typically, a throwing action would show more dynamic arm extension towards the opposite individual, which is not present here.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the other individual have both hands raised, prepared to catch the frisbee?",
