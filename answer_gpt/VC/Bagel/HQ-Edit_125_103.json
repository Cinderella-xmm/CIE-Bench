        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, I observe a cylindrical golden container with black writing and some decorative elements, along with two stacks of bowls with lids. There is no teapot visible in Image B, so based on visual cues and common sense, I can conclude that Image B does not include a teapot with any floral decorations, such as a pink peony.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict any cups with tea. Instead, it shows multiple bowls with lids arranged by a decorative container. Therefore, amber-colored tea is not visible.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, which features a golden cylindrical container and stacked bowls, shows no sign of a teapot or floral designs. Thus, there can be no floral elements centrally located on a teapot.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
