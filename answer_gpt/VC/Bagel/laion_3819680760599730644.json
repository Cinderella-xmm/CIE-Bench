      "question": "Is the \"Canon\" logo present in white text on the top of the camera body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera is depicted in a cartoon style with prominent features and exaggerated elements for illustrative purposes. The 'Canon' logo is indeed present at the top of the camera, and despite the stylized presentation, it remains clearly visible in white text, maintaining its traditional placement and style similar to what would be expected on a real Canon camera.",

      "question": "Is the \"SX 60 HS\" text visible in silver lettering on the lower right side of the camera body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera is depicted in a cartoon style and does not include detailed model-specific inscriptions like 'SX 60 HS' on the lower right side. This area instead features stylized elements that align with the cartoon nature of the image. The emphasis here is on the playful and illustrative aspects of the camera, rather than specific technical details.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the inscriptions \"CANON ZOOM LENS 65x IS\" and \"3.8-247.0mm 1:3.4-6.5 USM\" visible around the lens barrel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lens is designed in a highly stylized and imaginative fashion, diverging significantly from real-world lens inscriptions which are absent in this cartoon depiction. The emphasis is on character and style, lacking the precise technical inscriptions found in real camera equipment.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the textured grip area on the left side of the camera body clearly visible with a pebbled or dimpled surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a cartoon illustration of the camera which omits realistic textural details such as a pebbled or dimpled grip surface. Instead, it features smooth and simplified shapes, emphasizing a playful rendition rather than realistic textures. This aligns with common cartoon styles where textural detailing is minimal or abstract.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the mode dial located on the top left of the camera body, near the grip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera is rendered in a cartoon style, and it does not include a clearly defined mode dial at the top left of the camera body near the grip, as would be seen in a realistic depiction. The representation focuses on a stylistic portrayal rather than including technical camera elements, leading to the conclusion that such a dial is absent.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a small circular flash unit positioned above the lens on the top center of the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera features an abstract and cartoonish representation without a small circular flash unit positioned above the lens at the top center. This cartoon depiction highlights exaggerated, character-like elements over actual camera structures, thus the flash unit is not discernible or present as it would be in a real camera image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the main body of the camera black in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a cartoon-style camera illustration where the main body appears black, consistent with common cartoon color representations for cameras. The use of black helps maintain visual familiarity with a typical camera design, even within a playful art style, suggesting the main body color aligns with traditional expectations.",
