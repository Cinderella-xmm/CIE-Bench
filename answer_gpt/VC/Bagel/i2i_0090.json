        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stapler in both the front and rear views appears to have a uniform primary color of blue. This can be determined by examining the consistent hue observed across the various parts of both staplers shown in the image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metallic hinge, an essential part of a stapler mechanism visible near the stapling area, can be seen in both the front and rear views in Image B. The hinges are typically metallic and reflective, allowing them to stand out from the blue body of the staplers.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front view shows two staplers aligned side by side with their fronts facing the viewer. The stapling slot, which is the opening where staples come out, is clearly visible in both staplers in the front view as the silver metallic slots are apparent.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both views of the stapler display a uniform color on the top surface without any separate light blue strip. The entire top area appears consistently colored in the same shade of blue, indicating no distinct strip present.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to be uniformly green in both views of the staplers. There is consistency in the green hue throughout the background space, indicating there are no variations or patterns breaking the uniformity.",
