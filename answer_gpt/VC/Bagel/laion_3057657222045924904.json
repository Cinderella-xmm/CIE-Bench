      "question": "Is the McLaren logo present on the front hood of the car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car displayed does not feature the McLaren logo on the front hood. The visual cues indicate that this is a model or display object in a box, rather than a real car with branding elements like a logo. Based on world knowledge, logos are commonly present on real cars, particularly high-end models for brand recognition. However, this model car lacks such detailing typical for models or toys, suggesting a more generic representation without detailed branding.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the front headlights shaped as narrow, trapezoidal units with sharp edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a car with headlights that appear to have a trapezoidal shape with sharp edges. The headlights are distinct and angular, with well-defined corners, which is a common design element in sports cars. Analyzing the shape and structure of the headlights with common design elements in such models confirms the trapezoidal shape with edges.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are red brake calipers visible behind the black multi-spoke wheels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels are visible, but the detailing such as the color of brake calipers is not explicitly visible. These wheels appear as part of a model or toy, which often lack the level of detail such as colored brake calipers. Red brake calipers are a common design feature in real performance cars, often highlighting the brand or performance aspect. The absence of visible colored calipers differentiates this model from a real car setup.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a black angular side air intake vent running along the door line?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the side design of the car displays an angular design element that resembles an air intake vent. Such features are common in sports car designs, enhancing aerodynamics. The black coloring and position along the door line suggest it is intended to be an air intake vent, similarly designed for style purposes in a model car.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the car painted in a metallic silver finish with visible surface reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a car within a display case that appears to have a white or matte finish, lacking significant surface reflections. Unlike real vehicles with metallic paint that shows noticeable reflections due to light interaction, this model likely has a simplified color finish consistent with model cars.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the car have a visible dihedral door line extending from the front fender to the rear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no explicit dihedral door line is visible. Dihedral doors are a hallmark of McLaren models where the doors hinge upwards. The model in the display does not show a distinct line that indicates a functional dihedral door mechanism, a detail usually avoided or simplified in replicas.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the car proportioned with a long front hood and short rear deck, characteristic of a mid-engine layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a car that has a balanced proportion between its front and rear, not particularly with a long front hood and short rear deck. Knowledge about mid-engine sports cars suggests a more centered cabin position between the wheels. The design of the model suggests a sports car but does not clearly emphasize this typical mid-engine proportion.",
