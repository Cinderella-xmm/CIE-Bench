      "question": "Does the standing doll retain its ballet pose with arms extended outward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the standing figure or object, though stylized in an art style resembling traditional Japanese woodblock prints, appears to be maintaining a pose with arms extended outward. This is similar to a ballet pose, although the context and details might vary due to the artistic representation. The association of the pose with ballet is supported by the standing figure's upright stance and arm positioning.",

      "question": "Is the standing doll still wearing a light-colored tutu?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the standing figure in a stylized manner with traditional attire resembling a light-colored skirt or kimono. The attire appears similar to a tutu in structure, being layered and extending outward from the waist, thus retaining the essence of a ballet tutu seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the seated doll still wear a pink top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seated figure is stylized, but the color of the top appears closer to a natural or neutral color palette rather than pink. Compared to Image A, where the seated doll has a distinctly pink top, this transformation results in a loss of the original pink hue.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both figures exhibit a more stylized black or dark hair typical of traditional Japanese art. This dark representation does not preserve the original blonde coloring found in Image A, including the braid characteristic of the standing doll.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains a similar composition to Image A, with one figure positioned standing and the other seated on a platform or display-like surface, resembling a display table. The basic configuration remains consistent with both appearing on the same surface and maintaining similar postures.",
