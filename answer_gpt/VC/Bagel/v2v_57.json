      "question": "Does the image retain the warm red and gold color palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color palette predominantly consists of warm tones such as dark orange and beige, reflecting a theme of warmth similar to Image A. While the specific objects differ (a LEGO figure and an animal model compared to the book and pitcher), the use of warm colors is retained. Thus, it achieves the intention of maintaining a warm palette despite the change in objects.",

      "question": "Is the wooden surface texture and tone preserved in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B replaces the wooden surface with a smooth base potentially made of plastic or another material. The surface looks entirely different, lacking the grainy texture typical of wood, and appears to be a smooth base under a glass or transparent dome. Image A features a distinct wooden texture beneath the book and pitcher. Thus, it's clear the wooden texture is not preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the reflective qualities of metallic surfaces retained in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not appear to showcase metallic surfaces like Image A does with the golden pitcher. Instead, it involves LEGO pieces and a glass or plastic display case without the dynamic reflections seen in metallic surfaces, thus these qualities aren't retained.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the textured appearance of the book cover retained in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks any book-like item with a textured cover. It instead displays a LEGO figure and an animal model, neither of which have the texture or appearance akin to a book cover. Image A includes a textured book, contributing to its detailed and tactile element. Image B misses this aspect entirely.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the background feature a gradient transition from deep amber to soft cream tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background with a distinct shift from dark orange tones on the left to lighter cream tones on the right, forming a gradient transition. Image A shows a more uniform background color without distinct ratio of depth or contrast suggested by gradient. Therefore, Image B does exhibit such a gradient transition.",
