    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the black-framed glasses with rectangular lenses and visible reflections on the lenses still present on the man's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's face does not display any eyewear. Given the area around the eyes is blurred, and considering typical attire in historical literature settings as depicted, glasses would not usually be part of this vintage style. This leads to judging that the glasses seen in Image A are removed in Image B.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the trimmed beard and mustache, particularly the defined jawline coverage and upper lip growth, still present on the man's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face in Image B is blurred, but the portrayed style and context suggest a refined, clean-shaven appearance typical of the era represented. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude the beard and mustache are absent in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the light brown, textured, swept-back hairstyle with visible volume and side-parting still present on the man's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the aesthetic and setting of Image B, the hairstyle typical of the era is slicked back or neatly styled, possibly differing from the modern style observed in Image A. However, due to the vintage theme inherent in the surroundings and attire, the hairstyle would likely be a stylized version fitting the period, suggesting no swept-back and volumized texture as indicated in Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both hands positioned near the writing object (book), with the right hand showing a grip-like pose and the left hand partially extended toward the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both hands are visible and positioned along the edges of a book with the hands appearing relaxed rather than in a grip-like pose found in a typing context. This suggests a change in hand positioning from Image A.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the table surface still a flat, white, matte plane with soft reflections and no visible texture or pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table appears textured and decorated with a patterned finish, differing from the sleek and simple white surface evident in Image A. This reflects a change from modern simplicity to more ornate design typical in historical or literary-themed settings.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the lighting still coming from the front-left, creating a soft highlight on the left side of the face and a subtle shadow on the right side of the neck and shoulder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B appears even and diffused across the scene, consistent with older artistic portrayals where shadows and highlights are carefully balanced for a more uniform illumination of the scene. The specific lighting directionality evident in Image A is absent in Image B due to differing artistic renderings and style.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the man still seated with his torso slightly leaned forward, head tilted upward and to the right, eyes looking up and away?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the man seated with an upright posture, typical of historical posture in art, with no visible tilt in the head suggesting engagement with the book in front of him. The previous posture that suggests disengagement in Image A does not align with the face-forward orientation in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is there a large, open, leather-bound book placed on the table directly in front of the man?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly depicts a large, open book positioned centrally in front of the man as part of the historical theme depicted. While in Image A there is a typewriter indicating a typing task, the book in Image B signifies a shift in the narrative context to reading or writing typical of historical literary representation.",
