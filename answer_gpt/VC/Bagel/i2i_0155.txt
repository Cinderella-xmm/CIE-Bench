    "Question": "Q2: Is the plant still positioned on the windowsill in the same manner as in the original image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background with the windowsill has been removed, and the plant is centrally placed on a plain background instead. This indicates that the positioning on the windowsill is not retained, as the context of a windowsill is no longer present.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the soft sunlight and its interaction with the plant and windowsill preserved as in the original?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the soft sunlight effect and interaction seen in Image A are not present. The edited image has a uniform background that does not showcase light interaction as seen in the original image. This change is due to the editing that places the plant on a solid background devoid of lighting effects.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the blurred greenery visible through the window still present and unchanged?",
    "explanation": "Image B lacks any window or background greenery.
