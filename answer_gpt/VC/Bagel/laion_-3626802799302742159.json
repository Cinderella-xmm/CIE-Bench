      "question": "Are the cookies still golden-yellow in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cookies are depicted as chibi characters with a golden-yellow color. Chibi is a style of drawing characters in a cute, exaggerated form, often with oversized heads or facial features. Each character still maintains a golden-yellow hue, similar to what you might expect from actual cookies. Therefore, based on the visual information in Image B, the cookies are indeed golden-yellow in color.",

      "question": "Is there a red jam filling in the center of each cookie?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cookies have been transformed into cartoon characters and lack the red jam filling seen in Image A. Instead of a jam center, they have large black eyes, cheeks, and mouths as part of their facial features. This alteration focuses on giving the cookies a personified expression, replacing the red jam with cartoon-like features.",

      "question": "Is the mug white with black speckles and a handle on the right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mug is depicted in a chibi style, and it appears mostly white, consistent with Image A's color scheme. However, instead of black speckles, it has small colorful floral patterns along its exterior. The handle is positioned on the right side, similar to Image A. Thus, while the color remains white and the handle placement is accurate, the speckled pattern is replaced with floral designs.",

      "question": "Is the plate pink with a speckled texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the plate with a white background and colorful floral designs, differing significantly from the pink speckled plate in Image A. The edited image has discarded the original speckled texture entirely for the floral print, which complements the chibi theme but does not align with a pink, speckled description.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are some cookies inside the mug and others arranged on the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, one cookie character is positioned inside the mug, while two other characters are outside, standing beside the plate. There is also a miniature table and chairs set on the plate, which does not host any cookies due to the human-like construction of each cookie in Image B. Thus, here, cookies are not arranged inside the mug and on the plate like in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do both the mug and the plate have a speckled surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks the speckling seen on both the mug and plate in Image A; instead, it shows a floral design on the cup and plate. The lack of speckle in their surfaces indicates that both items have undergone considerable edits, which create a more colorful visual instead of a simple speckled texture.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mug is smaller relative to the plate and appears centrally placed. Consistent with the original layout, despite character additions and thematic adaptations, the mug maintains the position as being centered regarding the plate, adhering to common placement logic typically seen in food service.",
