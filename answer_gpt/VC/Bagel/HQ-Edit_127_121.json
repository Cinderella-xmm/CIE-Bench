      "question": "Is the circular orb-web with clearly defined radial and concentric threads still present and structurally intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orb-web still includes a central region with radial and concentric threads that are part of the design. However, the presence of the large, central ornamental butterfly-like structure suggests that the focus has shifted from a traditional spider web pattern to this ornamental element. The web’s original pattern is still visible behind the ornament, indicating that it remains structurally intact in terms of visual representation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the branches positioned in a natural arc around the web, supporting it from multiple directions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the branches continue to display a natural arc, wrapping around the web, creating a supportive frame. The positioning and angles in Image B remain similar to Image A, as they appear to cradle both the web and the added ornamental object, ensuring that the branches are still functionally and visually supporting the web structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the leaves retain their oval shape, visible venation, and glossy surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In analyzing Image B, the leaves still exhibit an oval shape, though the glossy surface texture and detailed venation are less pronounced than in Image A. This suggests that while the basic shape is retained, the focus on detailing has shifted slightly, likely due to the increased attention on the ornamental centerpiece in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there small, clear water droplets visible on the surfaces of some leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination of Image B, the leaves do not show distinct, small water droplets as seen in Image A. The attention is drawn more to the central decorative piece, which overshadows smaller details like water droplets on the leaves.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background a soft, uniform pale blue-gray sky without additional elements such as clouds or sun?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B retains its soft, uniform pale blue-gray tone similar to Image A. There are no added elements of clouds or sun, maintaining a minimalist sky background that does not distract from the main visual feature, the decorative embellishment at the center.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the web’s radial threads visibly connected to the branch ends at multiple points?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the web pattern is partially obscured by the central decorative piece, the radial threads that are visible do appear to connect to various points on the branches, similar to their original attachments in Image A. This suggests that these connections remain intact, maintaining the visual connection between the web and its supporting branches.",
