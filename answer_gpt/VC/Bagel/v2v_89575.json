      "question": "Is the infinity pool's edge still visible and defining the boundary between the water and the surrounding landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pool's edge is visible as a distinct line where the water meets the stone relief sculpture, defining the boundary clearly between the water and the background. The edge of the pool maintains its function of separating the water from the landscape, even though the latter has been transformed into a carved stone design. Based on visual information, the edge is still a defining feature. In Image A, the pool's edge similarly delineates the boundary between water and the natural landscape.",

      "question": "Is the woman still positioned centrally in the pool, maintaining her original orientation relative to the pool's edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is still positioned in a similar spot in the pool, leaning against the edge as seen from the way her arms and shoulders are placed against it. Her orientation relative to the pool's edge appears to have remained consistent, suggesting no significant positional change. In Image A, the woman is seen in the same relative position.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the traditional-style buildings with tiered roofs still visible in the background, integrated into the stone relief design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background has been transformed into a carved stone relief, and there are no visible indications of traditional-style buildings or tiered roofs that were present in the original Image A. The background has been reimagined entirely as part of the artistic stone relief without direct architectural elements from the original.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the dense tropical foliage, including palm trees, still present in the background, albeit reimagined as part of the stone relief?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a carved stone relief that incorporates elements resembling plants, but these are stylized and different from actual dense tropical foliage. Although vegetation forms are present as artistic carvings, the original realistic appearance, including details like palm trees visible in Image A, are not directly comparable due to the artistic transformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the scene retain a bright and clear lighting effect, consistent with the original sunny day atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the artistic transformation of the scene into a stone relief, the overall lighting appears bright, suggesting a well-lit environment. This clear lighting effect indicates that the brightness and clarity consistent with a sunny atmosphere in Image A are retained. The artistic depiction does not dampen the perceived light quality.",
