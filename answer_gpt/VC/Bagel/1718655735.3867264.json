    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the angular, filigree-patterned metallic mask covering the upper face, including the prominent crest and eye-covering section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fairy in a glass dome features no mask on her face as seen in Image A. In common fairy figurines, detailed masks are uncommon as the focus is usually on dresses and wings. Based on these visual cues, the mask from the original image is not present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the butterfly wings retained with their original veined structure and mottled brown-orange coloration, even if rendered with a metallic or shimmering surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings in Image B feature a metallic and shimmering texture, typical of decorative fairy figurines. However, they do not retain the original veined structure and mottled brown-orange coloration seen in Image A, suggesting alterations to suit the ornamental portrayal common in figurines.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the thin wire or cord extending from the base of the left wing still present and connected to the wing structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible thin wire or cord connected to the wings. Figurines often exclude such details for aesthetic or practical purposes, which leads to the conclusion that this feature is absent in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the outfit retain the halter-neck silhouette with lace-like embroidery along the torso and arms, including the high waist and fitted form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fairy wears a bluish dress with decorative floral elements and a crown, differing from the original Image A's detailed lace-like embroidery and fitted dress structure. The changes reflect a common approach to miniature fairy figurines’ attire, which often utilize simpler and more fantastical designs for ornamental effect.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the fairy head-on with a frontal pose, typical of decorative items like snow globes or glass domes intended to display the figure fully towards the viewer, thus differing from the side profile pose seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Imagery B lacks any visible dangling beaded earrings, a detail that is often omitted in miniature representations where scaled-down figures usually do away with minor accessories to focus on the core aesthetic elements like dresses or wings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes and lips are not visible on the fairy figurine, suggesting no emphasis on detailed facial features, which is common in small ornamental designs. Therefore, the elements from Image A, such as closed eyes and red lips, are not retained.",
