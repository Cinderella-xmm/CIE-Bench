      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the transformation into a stained-glass style, the skateboard maintains its elongated rectangular shape with rounded ends. The colors and patterns have changed, evident by the vibrant blue color and stained glass design, but the basic outline remains unchanged. This is assessed based purely on shape recognition. Comparison with Image A shows that the shape is consistent, despite the change in style.",

      "question": "Is the stainless steel sink's oval shape and placement on the countertop retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the sink in a stained-glass format, but its oval shape and placement on the countertop remain consistent with typical sink designs. The artistic transformation mainly affects the coloration and texture but does not alter the fundamental shape or positioning. Comparison with Image A confirms that while aesthetics are altered, the placement and shape are preserved.",

      "question": "Are the wooden cabinets with silver handles and their arrangement retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cabinets have been artistically altered to appear as stained-glass, incorporating various colors and patterns, yet their arrangement and structure remain notably similar. The silver handles are retained, albeit styled to fit the stained-glass theme. When comparing with Image A, it's evident that despite stylistic changes, the layout and elements are preserved.",

      "question": "Is the skateboard still leaning against the cabinet in the same position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The position of the skateboard in Image B remains unchanged from Image A, leaning against the cabinet in a similar location and angle. The change is primarily in its visual style, transitioning into a stained-glass appearance without altering its stance or leaning angle. Comparatively, both images show the skateboard aligned similarly relative to the cabinets.",

      "question": "Are the beige tile patterns on the floor and white tile patterns on the wall retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B transforms the entire scene into stained-glass, including the tiles. While the stained-glass effect changes the appearance, particular patterns typical of beige floor tiles and white wall tiles are not distinctly discerned in this artistic vision. The transformation results in a loss of the original tile coloring and patterns seen in Image A, indicating a significant stylistic departure.",
