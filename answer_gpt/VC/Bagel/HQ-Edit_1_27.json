    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the intricate iron lattice structure of the Eiffel Tower present, including its characteristic crisscross pattern and open framework?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower is depicted as a miniature inside a glass dome, displaying simplified, less detailed features compared to its full-scale, intricate lattice structure in real life. The crisscross pattern is less pronounced, and the open framework typical of the real Eiffel Tower is not fully represented due to the limitations of miniature design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the arched base of the Eiffel Tower visible, with a clear central passage beneath the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the Eiffel Tower as part of a small-scale scene. Its base does not distinctly feature the arched structure with a passage as seen in the Eiffel Tower's actual architectural design; instead, the miniature focus is more on compact representation without those specific details.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the spire and crown structure at the very top of the Eiffel Tower present and clearly defined?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower miniature does include a form resembling a spire and crown at the top, but due to the scale, it lacks the clarity and definition of the actual crown structure on the full-size tower.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the rows of lampposts and bare-branched trees symmetrically arranged along both sides of the central path leading to the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a miniature scene with lampposts and trees, but due to the compact size of the model, it does not emphasize the symmetrical arrangement as clearly as in full-scale settings. The elements are designed to fit within the small space without strict symmetry focusing.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there figures in the foreground positioned facing the Eiffel Tower, with some appearing to take photographs or observe it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes small figures in the foreground facing the Eiffel Tower within a glass dome, giving the impression of the figures being part of a scene but not distinctly engaging in photography or observation due to the diorama's decorative nature.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the central pathway extend directly toward the Eiffel Tower, creating a strong linear perspective with convergence at the towerâ€™s base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's design presents a pathway leading toward the Eiffel Tower, but it is miniature-sized and lacks the strong linear perspective and convergence typical of a real-life representation due to the spatial limitations of the model.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the ground fully covered in snow, with visible accumulation around the base of the tower and along the path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scene inside the dome in Image B simulates a snowy environment where the ground appears covered in snow, yet the depiction is more stylistic than detailed, accommodating the miniature display rather than realistic accumulation.",
