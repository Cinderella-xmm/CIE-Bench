    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the three distinct mountain peaks—two broad and one sharp—present and positioned in the same relative layout as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a fantasy creature with horns and glowing features is shown, not any natural landscape elements. The absence of mountains or any landscape dictates that the same layout as Image A cannot exist. Image A depicts mountains with a clear formation, hence the comparison reveals completely different subjects and elements.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the lake located in the same basin with the same irregular shape, including the curved western edge and shallow extension toward the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a graphic illustration focusing on a creature with no landscape features like lakes visible. Image A clearly depicts an unevenly shaped lake within a basin, but Image B does not align with these geographic elements.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the trails maintain their original routing pattern across the slopes, including their connection to the lake and convergence points?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on a creature with no visible trails or slopes. The absence of such elements in Image B, contrasted with substantive hiking trails in Image A, confirms there is no trail pattern repeated.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible human figures present near the shoreline of the lake, consistent with their placement in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exclusively features an illustrative creature with no humans or shorelines present. Image A shows people near the lake, but there is none of that observable in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the rocky outcrops and boulders visible along the shoreline and slopes, maintaining their original distribution and size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is entirely distinct, presenting a creature rather than a natural scene. Image A includes rocky outcrops and boulders, which are absent in the graphic scene depicted in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the green vegetation cover present across the slopes, maintaining its general distribution and density as seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a stylized rendering focusing solely on a creature, and does not depict any slopes or green vegetation. In contrast, Image A contains green vegetation across a landscape, meaning the two are vastly different in subjects displayed.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the sky clear blue with scattered wispy clouds, matching the original atmospheric conditions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B does show a clear blue sky, it lacks the wispy clouds seen in Image A. Instead, Image B focuses on fantasy elements, showcasing a digital rendering distinct from the original realistic scene, indicating differences in atmospheric representation.",
