    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the brand name \"Karls\" clearly visible on the label of the jar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the label on the jar has the text 'Pinuk'iil Primiun Spice'. The brand name 'Karls' is not visible. Analysis involves recognizing text on the jar and using visual cues to assess text clarity and branding.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the text \"Pumpkin Spice Popcorn\" present on the label of the jar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the label on the jar shows 'Pinuk'iil Primiun Spice'. The text 'Pumpkin Spice Popcorn' does not appear in this image. The conclusion is derived from an analysis of text visibility and content on the jar.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the popcorn contained in a clear glass jar with a silver metal lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jar holding the popcorn is depicted as a glass jar, fitting the typical appearance of glass preservation objects, but the lid's color is part of an illustration and appears orange, not silver. The interpretation comes from recognizing the image style and assessing the attributes of the jar.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a white ceramic bowl with a blue rim containing popped popcorn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains three bowls filled with popcorn depicted in an illustrative style, without any specific rim detailing that suggests it is ceramic or has a blue rim. Deduction encompasses analyzing the illustrated bowl features and their contrasting attributes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question": "Are unpopped corn kernels visible in a separate clear jar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, corn kernels are not displayed in a separate jar. The imagery focuses on illustration with popped popcorn in bowls and a jar. Judgement arises from noticing the absence of characteristic unpopped kernels and jar styling.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors of the labels and popcorn orange and brown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color palette for both labels and popcorn includes dominant orange shades while presenting a cartoonish representation without distinct brown tones; the colors are simplified in the illustrated style. Interpretation involves identifying prominent colors and their stylized depiction.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the scene set on a wooden surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contextually appears on a flat illustrated background without wooden textures or surfaces. Decisions are based on visual cues within simplified illustrations rather than realistic settings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are unpopped or popped popcorn kernels scattered on the surface around the jars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, kernels are not portrayed on any surface around the jar; they are confined within containers and drawings. Deductions come from inspecting scattered elements and identifying implementation in cartoon designs.",
