    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the vessel positioned in the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vessel is depicted as an intricate cup adorned with jewels and it is placed slightly towards the left side of the image, rather than in the center. The main focus is on the cup and the ethereal figure emerging from it, rather than central positioning.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a circular tray directly beneath the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vessel is a jeweled cup placed on a richly decorated surface, but there is no indication of a circular tray directly beneath it. The focus is more on the cup and the decorative elements around it rather than a supporting tray.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does vapor or smoke originate from the top opening of the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a misty, vapor-like figure emerging from the top of the jeweled cup. This gives the impression of smoke or vapor that is semi-transparent and intricate in design, similar to steam emanating from the vessel.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the vessel have a conical or upward-tapering shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vessel is a jeweled cup with a rounded shape and elaborate handles. It does not have a conical or upward-tapering design as the top is wide and circular rather than narrowing upward.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the vessel placed on a flat, patterned fabric surface that covers the visible ground plane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image A depicted a flat, patterned fabric surface, Image B shows a vessel placed on an ornately decorated surface with jewels and intricate patterns. The surface is patterned, but it is more like decorative fabric with embellishments rather than a flat fabric only.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a small opening at the top of the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a wide opening at the top of the jeweled cup from which the vapor-like figure emerges. This makes the opening larger than what would be described as 'small'.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the tray made of a material visually similar to the vessel (e.g., terracotta)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible tray beneath the vessel, and the vessel is made of jeweled material. Therefore, there is no tray resembling terracotta or any similar material.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Does the fabric beneath the vessel display a structured geometric pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface beneath the vessel is embellished with jewels and ornate patterns rather than structured geometric designs like in Image A. The decoration is elaborate and more fluid than geometric.",
      "weight": 1,
