    "Question": "Q1: Does the bookmark retain the curved, tapering silhouette of the central golden skyscraper?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the second bookmark from the left represents a skyscraper with a slender, tapering shape. It retains some aspects of the central skyscraper's silhouette from the original Image A where the golden skyscraper also has a curved and tapering top. The hallmark of the skyscraper, captured in the bookmark, is its narrowing towards the top, maintaining the tapering silhouette.",

    "Question": "Q5: Does the bookmark preserve the height-to-width ratio and tapering proportion of the central skyscraper?",
    "explanation": "The central skyscraper in Image A is characterized by its towering height and tapering form.
