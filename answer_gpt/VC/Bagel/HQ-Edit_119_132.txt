    "Question": "Q1: Is there a distinct white stripe running vertically between the eyes on the dog's face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object in question is a plush dog toy, not a real dog. There is a white area on its face, but it's designed as part of the facial features to accentuate its eyes and snout, rather than a stripe. Based on world knowledge, plush toys often have simplified patterns that mimic real animals but do not always reflect their exact markings. Therefore, there's no distinct stripe as seen in a real dog's features.",
