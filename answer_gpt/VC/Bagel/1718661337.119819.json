      "question": "Is the white powdered wig with tightly curled sides still present on the figure's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image presents a character wearing a white wig, typical of historical or fantasy figures. In the edited image, the character still wears a white wig with features resembling tight curls at the sides, consistent with how such wigs are traditionally depicted. This indicates that the wig is still present despite the facial blur.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the figure wear a tricorne hat with a dark blue base and gold trim around the brim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the details of the hat in the edited image, it appears different from a tricorne style. The hat worn by the character in Image B is consistent with a steampunk aesthetic and does not match the tricorne description with a dark blue base and gold trim. Thus, the hat has been altered or replaced.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the right hand extended forward, gripping an object with the thumb and fingers wrapped around it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right hand is visible and appears to be gripping an object. The positioning of the hand and fingers suggests it is holding something, similar to Image A, implying that the action of gripping is consistent between the two images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The left hand in the edited image is positioned near the lower torso, evident from its placement and posture suggesting an inward or downward facing palm. This positioning remains similar between both images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features in Image B have been blurred, making it impossible to evaluate the visibility or consistency of specific facial features like the nose, eyes, and jawline.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the figure's posture in Image B, the three-quarter profile facing slightly right is consistent with the typical artistic representation and the positioning seen in Image A. The body is angled slightly toward the viewer in both images.",
