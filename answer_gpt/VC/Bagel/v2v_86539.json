      "question": "Do the characters retain their potato-like shape and texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters have been transformed into a more humanoid form. The original potato-like shape and texture, which were round and smooth, are now depicted with limbs and facial features that are more human-like. The texture has shifted from a potato-like skin to a smooth cartoonish surface. Therefore, the characters no longer retain their original potato-like appearance.",

      "question": "Is the potato character in the first panel still depicted as exercising with dumbbells and wearing a green headband?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character in the first panel is indeed exercising and wearing a green headband, which is consistent with exercising. Although the form has changed from a potato character to a more humanoid depiction, the activity and key features, such as the headband, are retained. There are no dumbbells visible, but the stance suggests an exercising activity.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the potato character in the second panel remain inside a cardboard box, indicating sleep?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The second panel in Image B shows the character inside a cardboard box, but the context has changed. The character appears more alert and focused, as indicated by the upright posture and surrounding environment, which doesn't explicitly indicate sleep. The character's posture and expressions indicate an awake activity rather than sleeping.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the potato character in the third panel still seated at a table with food items, indicating eating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fourth panel depicts a character seated at a table with food items, consistent with eating. The setting and activity directly align with the action of eating, even though the character is no longer potato-shaped.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all three panels distinctly showing the activities of exercising, sleeping, and eating respectively?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the panels depict exercising, being in a box (not explicitly sleeping), and eating. While the first and third activities correspond to exercising and eating, the second activity appears to be sitting inside a box but not sleeping. Therefore, the activities do not distinctly correspond to exercising, sleeping, and eating.",
