      "question": "Does the owl retain its brown and white spotted feather pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl is represented as a LEGO-style figure. The figure retains a brown coloration with a light brown or tan pattern on its chest area that simulates the original brown and white spotted design. This transformation maintains a representation of the original feather pattern even though it's more stylized to fit the LEGO appearance. My analysis combines visual recognition of the LEGO coloring with knowledge that LEGO maintains simplistic and minimalistic patterns.",

      "question": "Are the owl's large yellow eyes and black beak present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO owl figure's head features large yellow circles with black centers, resembling eyes, similar to the large yellow eyes of the original owl depiction. Additionally, a black triangular shape is present where the beak would be, consistent with the black beak in the original image. My conclusion is based on the visual representation allowing recognition of typical LEGO eye and beak designs mirrored from conventional depictions.",

      "question": "Is the owl still wearing a graduation cap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl figure is encased in a display box and is not wearing any form of hat or graduation cap. The LEGO owl lacks any equivalent accessory. The absence of a graduation cap, which was prominent in the original owl image, suggests it is not depicted in the LEGO version. This deduction uses common expectations for LEGO minifigures that rarely include such specific accessories unless explicitly designed to do so.",

      "question": "Does the owl continue to hold the rolled-up diploma tied with a yellow ribbon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO-style owl does not show any accessory or component like a rolled-up diploma. The LEGO figure's hands are designed to grip objects but are shown empty. This observation, contrasted with the original owl image holding a diploma, suggests the absence of this element in the transformation, fitting with standard LEGO minifigure simplicity.",

      "question": "Are there still three books stacked beneath the owl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl is displayed on a pedestal within a glass case without any books or visible stack beneath it. The original image's stack of books is not mirrored in this presentation, as LEGO showcases tend to minimize additional components to highlight the main figure. This identification is based on visual observation and understanding of typical LEGO display practices.",
