      "question": "Do the apples retain their vibrant red color with white speckles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays two apples with a vibrant red color and noticeable white speckles, as indicated by their appearance. The visual representation aligns with world knowledge of how fresh apples appear when well-lit and photographed, keeping their characteristic white speckles intact.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the apples shown with a smooth, shiny texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apples appear smooth and shiny. The visible reflections and sheen on the apple surface suggest a glossy texture, characteristic of fresh, well-photographed apples. This visual impression aligns with common knowledge that a shiny surface is depicted through light reflections.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is natural light visible, creating realistic reflections on the apple surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows apples with reflections, which are created by natural light hitting the apples. The presence of shadows and highlights demonstrates the effect of light sources on the apples' surfaces. This suggests realistic lighting conditions, typically seen in real-world settings with natural sunlight.",

      "question": "Does the image retain the rustic wooden texture of the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table's surface texture is not visibly detailed as it mostly focuses on the apples and textual additions. The edited image presents a more minimal background, which lacks the noticeable details one would use to describe as a rustic wooden texture.",
      "weight": 1,

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background softly blurred with hints of natural greenery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, has removed the blurred natural greenery background seen in Image A. Instead, it features a plain background to accommodate added text. The absence of greenery or any blurred elements suggests that any hints of a natural setting have been minimized or removed.",
