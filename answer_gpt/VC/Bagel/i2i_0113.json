      "question": "Does the edited image retain the detailed tactical suit design, including the texture and pocket placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the detailed tactical suit design is depicted in a chibi or toy-like caricature style. While the primary features such as the belt, pockets, and overall suit design are simplified and exaggerated relative to the original realistic depiction, they are retained in a basic form. The detailing of textures as seen in a realistic image is not possible in the chibi style, which inherently simplifies features.",

      "question": "Does the edited image preserve the character’s red hair with the same wavy style and color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image presents the character's red hair in a simplified, cartoonish form typical of chibi representations. Although the hair's color and the general wavy style are present, the intricacies of the waves and the detailed shadowing seen in realistic depictions are not preserved due to the simple style requirement of chibi figures.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the character’s original pose, showing a confident stance, retained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the character in a chibi form, which inherently alters the proportions and stance compared to a lifelike depiction. The chibi figure has a standing pose, but it does not convey the same confident or realistic stance because chibi characters are typically more static and less expressive.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited chibi image, the red straps of the character’s attire are still present, providing contrast against the black suit. The style and detailing are simplified, as characteristic of the chibi art form, but the color placement is intact.",

      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the primary black color of the tactical suit with red highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image continues the pattern of the black tactical suit with red highlights even in its simplified chibi form. Although there is a simplification in detail, the essential color scheme remains evident in the representation.",
