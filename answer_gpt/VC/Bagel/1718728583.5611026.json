      "question": "Does the edited image retain a humanoid robot with a distinct head, torso, arms, and legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot maintains a humanoid form with clear segments for the head, torso, arms, and legs. The geometric shapes and angular design elements communicate its humanoid nature while providing a stylized aesthetic.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts flamingos in a stylized form. Their presence is indicated through geometric shapes and colors that resemble the iconic pink tones and distinctive posture of flamingos, utilizing abstract art elements to convey their representation. The stylized interpretation provides a modern and artistic rendering while still recognizable as flamingos based on their form and coloration.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the environment does not explicitly showcase a sandy beach or a body of water. The stylized background includes geometric shapes and colors that may evoke a landscape setting, but it lacks direct representations or elements indicating sand or water, focusing instead on abstract forms and patterns.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot in Image B is amidst a group of stylized flamingos, suggesting an artistic interpretation of them encircling or surrounding the robot. The composition places the robot within this grouping, indicating its proximity and relationship to the flamingos as a central aspect of the scene.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains stylized and abstract forms that can be interpreted as palm trees, visible through their geometric depiction. However, rock formations are absent, and the composition instead focuses on angular shapes and figures without elements that reflect rock formations.",
