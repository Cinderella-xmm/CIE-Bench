    "Question": "Q2: Does the elephant have two visible, curved white tusks extending from its mouth?",

    "Question": "Q3: Is there a flat wooden platform positioned between the horse and the elephant, supporting the horse and resting on the elephant’s back?",
    "explanation": "Image B, transformed into a more artistic, classical sculpture style, shows a platform or pedestal, but its appearance does not distinctly resemble wood as in Image A due to the marble-like texture and color.",

    "Question": "Q4: Are both the horse and the elephant depicted in profile view, facing toward the left side of the image?",
