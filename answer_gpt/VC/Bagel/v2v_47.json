        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the seating area in the amphitheater is shown as concentric circles, forming a semi-circular arrangement, which aligns with the typical design in amphitheaters. This is validated through the simplified illustration that aims to capture the essence of such structures.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly showcases a tiered wall with multiple tiers of arches, which are characteristic of Roman-style amphitheaters. The visual simplification still captures the essence of this architectural feature.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the central circular area at the bottom, which resembles the stage area frequently seen in amphitheaters, with semi-circular seating surrounding it. This arrangement highlights the central focus typical in such designs.",
