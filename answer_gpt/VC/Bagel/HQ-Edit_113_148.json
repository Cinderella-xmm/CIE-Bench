      "question": "Does the transformed sculpture retain a central tall spire flanked by multiple smaller turrets arranged symmetrically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal sculpture features a prominent tall central spire, which is consistent with architectural aesthetics that emphasize balance and symmetry. This central spire is indeed flanked by multiple smaller crystal-like turrets that are arranged symmetrically around it, following a similar compositional strategy to enhance the visual appeal and grandeur of the structure. Such design principles are typically meant to convey strength and harmony.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there small red flags positioned at the tip of each turret of the crystal sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the crystal sculpture shows no presence of any red flags on the tips of its turrets. The material and style of the sculpture focus on a clean, sleek look using transparent or colored glass to simulate crystals, rather than adding ornamental flags which are not in alignment with the sculpture's design aesthetics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the shovel located in the foreground, angled toward the base of the castle, and partially submerged in reflective water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no indication of any shovel present within the scene. The focus is entirely on the crystal castle structure within a display case, eliminating any elements such as a shovel that might have been featured in a natural setting. The concept of featuring a shovel would be incongruent with the refined and museum-like presentation of the crystal sculpture.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the gemstones (replacing seashells) grouped in a cluster at the foot of the crystal castle, similar to the original shell arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the gemstones are arranged at the foot of the crystal structure within the glass display case. They are positioned in a manner that reflects an organized group, somewhat emulating the clustering effect seen with natural shell arrangements. Though they are not precisely replacing seashells, their arrangement achieves a similar aesthetic goal of adding decorative detail at the base.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the frosted glass slab feature a continuous horizontal wave pattern that mimics the original ocean’s rolling motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of Image B reveals that the base of the sculpture includes a frosted glass slab designed with a continuous wave pattern. This undulating pattern is deliberately reminiscent of waves found in the ocean, drawing visual parallels to the original image’s depiction of the sea. This approach illustrates an artistic attempt to capture and convey a fluid, natural movement within a static medium.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the tallest tower located centrally within the crystal sculpture, rising above all other structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal sculpture indeed features a central tower that distinctly rises above all other structural elements. This design choice echoes traditional architecture showcasing hierarchy through verticality, ensuring the central feature remains the focal point and maintaining consistency with classic castle motifs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the shovel retain a red blade and yellow handle, even if rendered in crystal or another material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, there is no depiction of a shovel at all, regardless of material, color, or design. The image's focus is solely on the crystal sculpture inside a display case, with no indication of elements like a shovel, which, if present, would detract from the sculpture's intended artistic theme centered around crystalline forms.",
