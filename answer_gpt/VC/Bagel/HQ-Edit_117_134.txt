    "Question": "Q1: Is the lid of the piano open and angled upward, revealing the internal structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object is designed to look like a piano but is decorated like a gingerbread sculpture, suggesting it is likely made of gingerbread. The lid of this gingerbread piano is indeed open and angled upward, similar to how a real piano lid would allow the sound to project outward. However, being made of gingerbread, it doesn't reveal the complex internal structure of a real piano, but it does replicate the same open lid design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Does the piano have four legs, each ending in a golden caster, supporting the body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gingerbread piano has four legs, but they do not end in golden casters. Instead, these are fully made of the same gingerbread material with decorative icing, so they do not match the description of legs ending in golden casters typically used to facilitate movement in actual pianos.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there exactly three pedals positioned in a row beneath the keyboard?",
    "explanation": "The gingerbread piano in Image B does not display real functioning pedals beneath the keyboard, which are typically present in traditional grand pianos for adjusting sound qualities. Hence, it doesn't meet the criteria of having exactly three functional pedals beneath the keyboard.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the keys arranged in the standard piano pattern of alternating white and black keys across the full length of the keyboard?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the keys of the gingerbread piano appear to mimic the pattern of a real piano with alternating colors, likely using icing to suggest black and white keys. However, the detailing does not accurately capture the consistent spacing and pattern typically found on a functional piano, but it does attempt to emulate that standard arrangement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a music stand attached to the top front edge of the piano body?",
    "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the gingerbread-style piano does not feature a music stand that you would typically find attached to the top front edge of an actual piano. This absence indicates a focus more on decorative rather than functional features.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the lid connected to the piano body via a visible hinge mechanism near the rear edge of the keyboard?",
    "explanation": "The gingerbread piano in Image B doesnâ€™t show a functional hinge mechanism that would be necessary for an actual piano lid. The lid appears to be positioned as if propped open, but without a visible hinge mechanism designed into the edible decoration.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the piano maintain the same elongated, curved-body silhouette and proportional dimensions as in the original image?",
    "explanation": "The gingerbread piano in Image B replicates a similar elongated and curved silhouette to that seen in Image A, which represents a traditional grand piano shape. However, as a decorative piece, the proportional dimensions may not be to scale compared to an actual piano. Nonetheless, the intention to mirror the original body's silhouette is evident.",
    "answer": "Yes"
