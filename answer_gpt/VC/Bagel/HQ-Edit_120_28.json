      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a visibly large coiled rope knot is positioned in the foreground to the left of the chest. This is identified by the intertwined fibers typical of ropes, often used aboard ships and fitting within the maritime theme.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature gold coins, colorful gemstones, and small golden pottery vessels near the base of the chest. Unlike Image A, these elements are absent, indicating a shift in thematic elements from a treasure-laden environment.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the layout of objects places the treasure chest positionally and conceptually between the coiled rope knot and drawn coins, rather than piles of physical coins and gems. This demonstrates the artistic interpretation of a treasure map rather than a direct visual representation of arranged physical objects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are vertical rigging ropes and partially visible sails present in the background behind the chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a primarily illustrated treasure map where vertical rigging ropes and sails are not directly visible behind the chest. However, the illustrative elements, such as rope borders and maritime symbols, maintain a thematic atmosphere without explicitly depicting ship sails and rigging as seen in Image A.",
