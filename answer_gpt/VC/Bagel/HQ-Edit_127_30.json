      "question": "Are the two symmetrical f-hole shapes present on the body of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object features markings that resemble traditional f-holes found on string instruments like violins. However, one side shows what appears to be text instead of the typical f-hole shape. F-holes are generally symmetrical and located on either side of the instrument's body. In Image B, traditional symmetrical f-hole shapes are not evident; rather, there are artistic or decorative modifications. This suggests that the symmetrical f-hole shapes are not present in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the scroll with four tuning pegs located at the top end of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top end of the object appears to have a scroll with pegs consistent with traditional violin design. Common violins typically have a scroll at the top, which is an ornamental curved piece with tuning pegs. The edited image shows this scroll and pegs, which align with the upper end of a violin.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the object retain the classic violin silhouette with distinct upper and lower bouts and a central waist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates an object that maintains a general shape akin to a violin, with defined upper and lower bouts and a central waist. These features, characteristic of string instruments, create a recognizable silhouette. Despite stylistic changes in color and markings, the overall violin shape is discernible.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a clearly defined bridge area located between the two f-holes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the presence of a violin-like shape, the area between where the f-holes would typically be located does not have a defined bridge area. The bridge is normally a raised piece on a violin over which the strings pass, contributing to the sound production. In the edited version, this feature is not distinctly visible, possibly altered by artistic elements or design overlays.",

      "question": "Is the object positioned diagonally across the support surface, with the scroll pointing toward the upper right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is oriented diagonally across the cushion, with the scroll indeed pointing towards the upper right corner of the frame. This diagonal arrangement of the instrument maintains consistency with classical presentations and aligns with typical positioning on such support surfaces.",
