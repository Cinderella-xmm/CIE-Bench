    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the black and white stripes covering the zebra's body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the edited zebra is represented as a toy or cartoon-like character while maintaining the iconic black and white stripes pattern which covers its body, a characteristic feature commonly associated with zebras. Therefore, the stripes are present. Compared to the more realistic depiction in Image A where the zebra's stripes are naturally aligned with its body contours, in Image B, the cartoon representation simplifies this feature but retains the essence.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the ears of the zebra in the edited image still upright?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a zebra representation with exaggerated features typical of a toy, including upright ears. These ears maintain the vertical position commonly seen in zebras and mirror a slight cartoonish style. Image A also exhibits upright ears consistent with real-life zebras, suggesting that both images maintain this characteristic despite differing levels of realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a visible mane on the zebra's neck in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the edited zebra depiction presents a simplified mane, seen as a series of small, pointed dark sections following along the neck and near the top of the head, a stylistic approach for toys. A comparison with Image A reveals a natural, more detailed mane on the realistic zebra. The toy zebra retains this aspect, albeit simplified, suggesting it mirrors the real zebra feature.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the zebra in the edited image still have a tail with a tuft of hair?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the toy zebra with a small, bulb-like tail without a distinct tuft of hair. Image A presents a natural zebra tail ending with a tuft of hair, characteristic of real zebras. The toy representation omits this detail, focusing on a more minimalistic and stylized feature.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the zebra depicted in a standing posture in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the toy zebra is clearly in a standing position, with all four legs firmly on the ground. Image A further confirms that the zebra in a standing posture is typical, showing the realistic zebra on grassland. The consistency of posture across both images emphasizes a common feature in zebras, irrespective of realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"
