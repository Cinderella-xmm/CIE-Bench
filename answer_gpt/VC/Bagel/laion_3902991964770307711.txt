    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain exactly three arms—one central and two lateral—arranged symmetrically?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a perfume bottle, not a candelabra with arms. The bottle has a squared shape with no arms extending from it. The typical expectation for three arms is relevant in the context of a candelabra or similar item, but not applicable here for the perfume bottle design. Therefore, based on common sense understanding of object design, the answer is 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the left and right arms symmetrically positioned and shaped relative to the central axis?",
    "explanation": "Image B, as analyzed, shows a singular perfume bottle with no arms present. A symmetrical arrangement of arms relates to objects like candelabras, not applicable here. Thus, with common sense and design cues of perfume bottles as smooth singular forms, the answer is 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the base circular, flared, and adorned with a beaded or ridged edge?",
    "explanation": "Examining Image B, there is a base of the perfume bottle which appears flat and lacks the ornate features like a beaded edge indicative of a candelabra base. Perfume bottles generally exhibit simple, modern bases or none at all, so the answer is 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the central stem remain a tall, tapering vertical shaft connecting the base to the top arms?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a singular unit: a perfume bottle. There is no stem and no arms described. Perfume bottles typically don't have interconnected shafts like candelabras do. Thus, common sense paired with observation confirms the answer 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the arms maintain smooth, curved trajectories from the central stem to the top ends?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals no presence of arms or stems related to the typical candelabra form. Instead, a singular rectangular bottle is observable. Arms and smooth trajectories relate only to items like candelabras, confirming the answer is 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"
