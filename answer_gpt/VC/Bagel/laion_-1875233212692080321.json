      "question": "Does the perfume bottle include a shade of pink that matches the \"Rose Pink\" eyeshadow in the original palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle exhibits a strong pink color, predominantly the color of rose petals inside the bottle. This pink shade is comparable to common rose pink shades used in makeup palettes. By world knowledge, 'Rose Pink' is a typical hue in beauty palettes, which is a medium to dark pink similar to the pink in the perfume bottle.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the text \"Anastasia Beverly Hills\" visible on the perfume bottle or its packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is text visible on the perfume bottle; however, it reads 'IEABIBILNI,' which is not 'Anastasia Beverly Hills.' This suggests that the bottle branding differs from the known beauty brand, 'Anastasia Beverly Hills.'",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the perfume bottle feature an external accent in the color \"Burnt Orange\" as seen in the palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the bottle has a rose motif on top, colored in red, and gold accents. 'Burnt Orange' is a specific deep orange hue, but the current design does not contain this shade. Gold and red are present, aligning with common knowledge about luxurious bottle designs, but not with 'Burnt Orange.'",

      "question": "Is the dual-ended makeup brush visible in the final perfume bottle design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no makeup brush visible in Image B; the design focuses on the bottle's aesthetics, particularly its rose decoration and color accents, aligning more with luxury perfume branding rather than incorporating any brush elements. Thus, the brush is absent from the design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background of the image a soft pink gradient matching the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a pink background, contributing to a cohesive appearance with the bottle's color scheme. While Image A, features a different setting, the reasoning is based on the knowledge that soft pink gradients in product imaging convey warmth and appeal. The edited image indeed shows a soft pink background gradient.",
