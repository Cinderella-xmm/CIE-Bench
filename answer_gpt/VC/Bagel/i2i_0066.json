      "question": "Does the image retain the English Bulldog's tan coat and white facial markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is a stylized sculpture depicted entirely in white, without any distinct coloration or markings such as a tan coat or white facial markings. This transformation into a monochrome sculpture means all color details specific to the English Bulldog character are lost, resulting in a homogeneous appearance. Therefore, visually identifying the original coat or facial markings based on common animal breeds would be impossible as the sculpture lacks these features.",

      "question": "Is the English Bulldog still positioned balancing on the skateboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B is entirely in white on a pedestal, standing still and void of any skateboard or motion-related elements. The visual suggests a formal exhibition or presentation setting, where entities are typically static. The absence of a skateboard and the fixed sculpture pose mean the dog is not positioned balancing on a skateboard as it might appear doing in realistic scenarios.",

      "question": "Is the background still an outdoor setting with grass and buildings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's background showcases an indoor setting, likely an event or presentation area with people and indoor lighting. There is no depiction of grass, outdoor elements, or buildings as seen in open environments. The sterile and crowded atmosphere contrasts with outdoor landscapes commonly characterized by nature and structures.",

      "question": "Is the skateboard still blue with its original design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the dog as a sculpture standing on a pedestal with no skateboard visible. Therefore, visually identifying or confirming a skateboard's color or design from this sculpture presentation is impossible, as there are no elements associated with skateboards present in the image.",

      "question": "Does the English Bulldog still wear a black harness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B omits any colored harness; it merges all features into a single uniform white sculpture design, including the dog's body and any accessories, meaning color distinctions such as a black harness are lost in this depiction of the dog.",
