      "question": "Are there exactly three chairs positioned in a row, facing the bookshelf wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no chairs visible in the setting; instead, there are birds present on the bookshelf. This means the focus is on a natural, whimsical environment rather than a conventional seating arrangement. Therefore, there aren't three chairs positioned in a row. In contrast, Image A displays multiple chairs positioned in a row facing the bookshelf. Hence, Image B clearly differs as it doesnâ€™t include any chairs.",

      "question": "Are there two hanging pendant lights located above the seating area, one closer to the center and one toward the right edge of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are mushroom-like elements floating near the bookshelf, instead of pendant lights. These decorative mushrooms are part of the fantasy-like setting that Image B portrays. In Image A, pendant lights are visible above the seating area. Thus, Image B does not feature pendant lights as described.",

      "question": "Does the floor display a pattern of parallel diagonal shadows cast by sunlight entering from the right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a forest floor covered with grass and moss without any visible shadows or light patterns as mentioned. The elements differ from any structured indoor floor pattern. Meanwhile, Image A exhibits a pattern of shadows on the indoor wooden floor, cast from light entering through the slatted ceiling. Hence, such shadow patterns are absent in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a full-height wall of wooden shelves running along the left side of the room, divided into multiple evenly spaced rectangular compartments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookshelf structure is integrated into a tree with a whimsical appearance, not a conventional full-height wall as described. This contrasts with Image A, where a full-height wooden shelf wall with rectangular compartments is visible along one side. Image B instead merges the bookshelves into a fantastical forest setting.",

      "question": "Is the floor composed of light-colored wooden planks laid horizontally, extending from foreground to background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floor in Image B is represented as a forest ground comprised of soil and moss, not wooden planks. This natural setting is distinctly non-structured compared to Image A, where the floor is made of light-colored wooden planks, laid out horizontally in a traditional manner. Therefore, the forest-themed floor lacks such a design.",

      "question": "Are there small decorative objects placed within some of the shelf cubbies, including a white vase and a blue box with text?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shelves contain books and small creatures, following a naturalistic and whimsical motif. There are no vases or standard boxes with text. Comparatively, Image A has human-made decorative elements, including organized objects like vases and boxes. The thematic elements in Image B are not aligned with traditional decorative objects such as a white vase or a blue box.",

      "question": "Is the dominant color palette throughout the room composed of warm golden-brown hues across walls, ceiling, furniture, and flooring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is set in a forest environment, featuring a blend of earthy greens and browns typical of natural settings, not the uniform warm golden-brown hues of indoor furnishings and structures. On the contrary, Image A portrays an indoor scene with a consistent warm, golden-brown theme across its elements. Therefore, this color palette does not apply to the largely natural tones of Image B.",
