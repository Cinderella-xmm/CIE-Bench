      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there visible steam rising from the broccoli/tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the broccoli/tree is positioned on the forest ground with no visible steam or vapor surrounding it. Steam is typically a visible indication of heat, and it often appears above hot foods or in warm conditions. Given that the setting is an outdoor environment that resembles a natural forest floor, the presence of steam would be unusual and is not visible here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the broccoli/tree rest on a white plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the broccoli/tree is placed on a natural forest floor instead of a white plate. The ground in the image is composed of soil and organic matter typical of a forest setting. This contrasts with the artificial setting of a plate, which is used to serve food. The lush greenery and earthy tones reinforce the natural environment rather than a dining presentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the broccoli/tree primarily green in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object resembling broccoli is indeed green, which is aligned with the typical color of broccoli florets. This greenery is consistent with the appearance of a tree or plant found naturally in a forest environment.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the characteristic florets of the broccoli discernible on the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B matches the typical appearance of broccoli florets, which are small and clustered. These florets are recognizable and distinct from leaf structures typically found on trees, confirming the object's identification as broccoli.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the broccoli/tree have a defined stem-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a piece resembling broccoli with a definite stem that supports the top portion of the floret clusters, akin to how broccoli naturally grows. This stem is visually similar to the trunk of a tree, providing support and elevation.",
