    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain exactly six wheels arranged in three axles, with the front axle near the cab and two rear axles supporting the cargo body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck appears as a crystal model with a representation of six circular shapes resembling wheels, organized into three sets. Based on common truck designs and the visual arrangement, it suggests three axles. This visually matches attributes of axle placement commonly observed in trucks like the one depicted, with the front axle closer to the cab and two behind supporting a cargo area.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the cargo body positioned directly behind the cab, maintaining the same horizontal alignment and proportional length as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B visually presents a crystal truck where the cargo body is directly behind the cab, maintaining a proportional relationship between the cab's size and the cargo body. Based on standard truck designs, this configuration is typical. Comparing with Image A, the cargo body also aligns horizontally with the cab, suggesting consistency in the truck's overall design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there two rectangular windows visible on the side of the cargo body, located approximately one-third and two-thirds along its length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the crystal model depicted in Image B, two rectangular shapes resembling windows are visible on the cargo body's side. Their positioning aligns with a rough one-third and two-thirds division along the length, as can be noted by looking at typical truck designs. Checking against Image A, the positioning and number of windows matches, reinforcing this observation.",

      "question": "Is the vertical slatted grille present on the front of the vehicle, centered between the headlights and aligned with the hood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the crystal truck shows a vertical slatted grille prominently positioned between two cylindrical shapes which likely represent headlights, aligning with the hood's design as in standard vehicle models. This configuration matches the typical style seen in the same truck model from Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a side mirror attached to the driver’s side door, extending outward from the upper portion of the door?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a side mirror-like shape that can be inferred as extending from the upper portion of the driver's door. The visual cue matches the common logistics of side mirrors in truck designs, though portrayed in a stylized form within the crystal model. Image A confirms its presence in the same placement, bolstering this interpretation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a horizontal ladder affixed to the lower side of the cargo body, running parallel to the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's a detail along the side of the cargo body that could represent a horizontal structure similar to a ladder, depicted parallel to the base of the crystal truck. Common designs often include steps or ladders for access. Image A does show a similar ladder structure along the cargo body's side, verifying this observation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a silver-colored door handle visible on the driver’s side door, positioned midway down the door?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, being represented in crystal, doesn't exhibit color cues like silver; it visually lacks a distinct door handle midway down the driver's side door in the model. These handles are typically an identifiable feature found midway in common vehicles. Image A displays this detail clearly, contrasting the absence of a similar feature in Image B.",
