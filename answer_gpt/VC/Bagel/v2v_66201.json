      "question": "Is the monkey's face and expression clearly visible and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the monkey's face is blurred and therefore not visible, which makes it impossible to assess its expression. Blurring is an intentional distortion that affects overall visibility.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the background still feature a spiral galaxy with stars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background continues to depict a starry sky and a prominent spiral galaxy similar to a typical spiral galaxy seen in astronomical images. This suggests that the background still features these celestial elements.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the monkey's overall posture, including the upward extension of its tail, retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the monkey maintains a seated posture with its tail extending upwards, following the same natural curve visible in Image A. This indicates that the posture is retained.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a brass scientific instrument positioned in front of the monkey, similar to Image A. The positioning suggests the instrument is still on a surface near the monkey.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although various additional elements and modifications are present, parts of the wooden surface beneath the brass instrument are still visible, indicating its continued presence.",
