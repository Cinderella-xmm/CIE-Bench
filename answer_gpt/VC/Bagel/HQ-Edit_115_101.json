      "question": "Is the radial floral and scrollwork pattern with symmetrical swirls and leaf-like motifs present around the central area of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a bottle with a design that includes swirls and scroll-like patterns. This type of pattern is often ornamental and can give the appearance of floral motifs. By analyzing these visual cues, we recognize the decorative patterns around the label on the bottle. Given the presence of these elements, it's reasonable to conclude that the radial floral and scrollwork pattern is present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the Roman numerals I through XII arranged in a circular sequence around the central label or design element?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no Roman numerals visible arranged around the bottle's label. Instead, the bottle label prominently features text design. This conclusion is drawn from the lack of Roman numerals visually identifiable around the object. In Image A, however, there are Roman numerals visible in a circular pattern, typical of a clock face. Thus, our reasoning based on Image B leads to the conclusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the decorative patterns exhibit clear embossed relief with visible depth and shadowing, indicating raised surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a bottle with ornate designs on its label and body. The patterns show depth through shadowing, giving the impression of embossed relief. This is combined knowledge derived from shadow and lighting effects typically used to highlight raised surfaces in imagery.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a clearly defined central circular element positioned at the geometric center of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geometric center of the bottle is occupied by the label, and there is no discernible central circular design element apart from the bottle labeling itself. The circular element questioned does not feature prominently or distinctly. Comparatively in Image A, the watch face itself acts as a central circular element. This analysis leads to the conclusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are small decorative dots and filigree details integrated into the scrollwork, particularly at junctions and tips of curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the scrollwork has fluid curves and swirls, but there is no fine detail of filigree or small decorative dots evident at the junctions or tips of curves. The design appears to be more generalized without intricate detailing. Comparing this to the detailed embellishments typical in finely filigreed patterns, we conclude based on the visual texture observed.",
