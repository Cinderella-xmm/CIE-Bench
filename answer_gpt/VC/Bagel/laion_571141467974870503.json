    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the number \"1423\" clearly visible on the front of the train?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train is depicted in a stylized, graphic form. There are no discernible numerical details on the train due to the artistic style, which simplifies and abstracts details. Without numerical representation visible in the image, one cannot confirm the presence of '1423.'",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the train have two circular headlights below a central white circular light on its front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the stylized representation of Image B, the train features simplified shapes that might suggest headlights, but the graphic design lacks intricate detail. Due to the abstract nature of the representation, clear distinctions or specific formations of headlights as described are not visible.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there multiple vertical rows of white-framed windows on the side of the barn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's artistic rendering, with its pop art style, shows the barn's side with rows of vertically-aligned shapes implying windows. These shapes match the description of white-framed windows in an abstract way, utilizing typical barn features represented with stark contrast.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there two large wooden doors centered on the lower part of the barnâ€™s front facade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the barn is portrayed with black and red contrasts. The lower part of the barn is represented in a manner that doesn't clearly show two wooden doors. The details are highly abstract, inhibiting specific identification of 'wooden doors' as such.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the railway tracks extend forward from under the train and curve gently to the right into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the railway tracks are illustrated with bold lines that appear to extend straight into the distance without a discernible curve. The artistic style prioritizes simplicity over detailed perspective, influencing this interpretation.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the yellow triangular warning sign with a blue border and the \"50\" speed limit sign visible near the track on the left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict intricate or specific signs such as a yellow triangular warning sign with a blue border and a '50' speed limit sign. The style simplifies and omits such details, focusing more on broad shapes and colors.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the train positioned directly on the railway tracks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite its abstract pop art style, the train is clearly positioned over the tracks, based on visual representation. The tracks and train alignment in the graphic suggests they lie directly on one another, maintaining typical train-track interaction.",
