      "question": "Does the image retain the cylindrical, elongated shape of the baseball bats?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two objects maintain the elongated, cylindrical appearance characteristic of baseball bats. Despite the artistic and stylized representation, they still have the length and width consistent with that of a standard baseball bat. This conclusion is drawn from recognizing their shape and proportion, similar to objects used in sports.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the black taped handles of the bats still distinctly visible against the wooden shafts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the upper portion of each object is depicted in a darker color which resembles the black taped handles observed in baseball bats. The contrast between the darker colored handles and the lighter colored shafts is noticeable and is consistent with typical bat design, allowing observers to differentiate the handle from the shaft.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the two baseball bats remain parallel to each other in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two objects appear parallel, running side by side and maintaining an identical orientation relative to each other. Observing their parallel positioning—running the same length without converging or diverging—confirms that they retain their alignment similar to their depiction in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the bats still placed on a grassy surface, indicating an outdoor setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears grassy, resembling a stylized garden or natural field, which is consistent with an outdoor setting. This artistic interpretation keeps the original context introduced in Image A, where the grassy surface signified an outdoor space.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bats maintain their slight angle toward the viewer, preserving perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the perspective where the bats appear angled toward the viewer. This is implied by their diminishing size from their base to the tip, resulting in a visual effect that suggests depth and orientation similar to real-life perspectives.",
