      "question": "Is the brown, segmented, textured trunk of the palm tree present with visible horizontal ridges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trunk of the palm tree appears brown with a segmented texture and distinct horizontal ridges. World knowledge indicates that palm trees often have segmented trunks, which helps identify that the depicted trunk belongs to a palm tree.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the long, feathery green fronds forming a radial crown at the top of the palm tree present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the palm tree with distinctive long, feathery fronds that create a radial pattern forming a crown. These features are typical of palm trees, and they are visible above the trunk in the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, some palm frond tips are noticeably browned or dried, indicating the natural process of aging or environmental effects. Such browning is often seen when analyzing palm trees.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, the palm tree is placed to the left of the cactus and rises higher than the cactus. This placement and height difference are clear from the image composition.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm fronds predominantly display a green hue, with observable yellowing or browning along the edges. This color variation is common in palm trees, suggesting environmental factors or frond aging.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the palm tree maintain a tall, narrow trunk with a broad, rounded crown of fronds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The palm tree in Image B exhibits a tall, slender trunk and a wide, round arrangement of fronds at its crown. These characteristics align with the typical structure of many palm trees, especially those depicted in images.",
