        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transparent tank section is visible in the illustration showing the interior of the device. It showcases a section where the liquid content is visible, depicted in a cartoon-like cross-sectional view. This use of transparency indicates that the internal liquid can indeed be seen.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black mouthpiece is depicted as attached at the top of the device within the cartoonish cross-sectional illustration. It appears to be accurately positioned at the top, as expected in the design of a vape device.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the coil is visible and positioned at the bottom of the transparent section, which aligns with typical vape device construction where the coil is placed at the base.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the liquid inside the transparent section is visibly illustrated, showcasing a notable level. This cartoonish depiction allows viewers to see and assess the liquid level inside the vape device.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the internal components (coil, liquid, battery) arranged in a logically consistent vertical alignment within the device?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the internal components are displayed in a vertical cross-section of the device. The coil, liquid, and battery are all shown in a vertical alignment, consistent with typical electronic component arrangement within vape devices.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no clear indication or illustration of an airflow pathway or inlet. The cross-section focuses more on the internal components like the coil, liquid, and battery, without an explicit depiction of such features.",
