      "question": "Does the edited image retain the elderly man’s deeply wrinkled facial features, including the pronounced vertical lines on the forehead and crow’s feet around the eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the facial features are deliberately blurred, making it impossible to assess or describe any specific features like wrinkles, vertical lines on the forehead, or crow’s feet around the eyes. This alteration eliminates any detailed observation of facial characteristics present in the original image.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
