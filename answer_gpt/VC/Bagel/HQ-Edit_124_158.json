      "question": "Is the cat's fur pattern composed of dark brown or black stripes over a golden-orange base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat sitting on the throne has a predominantly white base with black or dark gray stripes, with no visible golden-orange coloring. This specific pattern is indicative of a traditional tabby coat rather than golden-orange. Hence, the answer is no.",

      "question": "Does the cat have greenish-blue eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat on the throne has eyes that appear more reflective and glassy, giving off a blueish hue. This could be interpreted as a subtle tone of greenish-blue depending on the lighting, which is common in aesthetic portrayals of cats. Therefore, with this consideration, the cat does have greenish-blue eyes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the cat’s front paws crossed over its chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's front paws are positioned calmly and symmetrically in front of it on the throne, not crossed over its chest. The paws are placed together, which is common for a seated cat rather than a crossed posture. Thus, the answer is no.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there two square throw pillows with red floral patterns on a cream background flanking the cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature any throw pillows. The cat is sitting on an ornate throne with no visible pillows around. The setting is different from typical domestic settings that would include such accessories. Therefore, the answer is no.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the cat’s tail curled along the left side of the settee?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no settee visible, as the cat is seated on a throne. The setup does not include a visible tail because the throne obscures any potential view of a tail being curled. Thus, the answer is no.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the settee upholstered in deep red velvet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no settee present. Instead, the backdrop is an ornate throne that appears to have a red seating area but is not specified as being upholstered with velvet. The absence of visual elements that clearly show a settee leads to the conclusion that the answer is no.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the cat have a white muzzle and long white whiskers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat on the throne does have a white muzzle, which is typical in tabby cats, and it also possesses long visible whiskers which are white. This is a common and expected feature in cats. Hence, the answer is yes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are the cat’s ears upright and pointed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat’s ears are clearly upright and pointed, which is a common feature in domesticated cats giving them a more alert and attentive appearance. This posture of ears is typical among many cat breeds, reinforcing this observation. Therefore, the answer is yes.",
