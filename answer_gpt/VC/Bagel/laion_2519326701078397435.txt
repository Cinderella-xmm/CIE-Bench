    "Question": "Q1: Is the bust oriented in a side profile facing to the right?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bust is presented in a frontal view where more of the front of the chest and both shoulders can be seen, rather than a side profile. This indicates that the orientation is not to the right side but rather facing forward. Additionally, world knowledge of busts being displayed in frontal orientations for full displays supports this observation.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there an inscribed plaque on the base with the word 'APOLLO' visible?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the bust does not appear to have any visible inscription or plaque with the word 'APOLLO'. Instead, the focus is on the intricate mechanical elements decorating the bust rather than textual or naming details.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the proportions of the neck, shoulders, and chest consistent with the original sculptural form?",
    "explanation": "Compared to Image A, which presents an idealized classical form with smooth transitions and human-like proportions, Image B incorporates mechanical elements that alter the visual proportions of the shoulders and chest. The mechanized additions obscure the original sculptural proportions, making them inconsistent with a classical form.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the drapery extend from the left shoulder across the chest in a diagonal fold?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible drapery extending from the left shoulder across the chest. Instead, mechanical components cover the area where the drapery would traditionally be displayed. This absence of drapery and the addition of gear-like elements imply that the traditional fabric representation is not present.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the base a cylindrical pedestal with a flat top and rounded bottom?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, despite the altered aesthetic with metallic sheen and mechanized appearance, the pedestal remains cylindrical in shape with a discernible flat top and rounded bottom. The world knowledge of common pedestal designs supports that this structure aligns with traditional pedestal forms.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a small circular medallion or button-like ornament on the left shoulder of the drapery?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not display any circular medallion or specific button-like ornament on the left shoulder. The shoulder area is composed of mechanical designs, lacking the classical adornments such as a medallion that would typically be found on drapery.",
    "answer": "No"
