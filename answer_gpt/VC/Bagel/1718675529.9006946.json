      "question": "Are ocean waves present and breaking onto the sandy shore?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the representation uses abstract patterns to depict waves using undulating and curvilinear forms that suggest movement typical of ocean waves breaking onto a shore. These patterns convey the idea of waves visually, even if abstractly. Thus, combining this visual representation with the common understanding of ocean waves interacting with a shore, the answer can be affirmed.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the sandy beach present and curving from the foreground toward the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents geometrical shapes and lines that imply a beach through the distribution of colors and patterns. The abstract curving forms and color compositions suggest a sandy area curving towards the right side if interpreted through the lens of artistic abstraction of a beach scene.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are palm trees visible along the coastline on the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are vertical shapes with fronds near the top, which closely resemble palm trees. Despite the abstraction, these shapes effectively communicate the presence of palm trees along the right side of the coastline when interpreted through the context of stylized, simplified artistic depiction.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there three distinct rock formations visible in the foreground sand, clustered together near the right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the abstract depiction of Image B, it is challenging to discern specific rock formations especially when considering their specific counts or positions relative to the sandy area. The stylistic representation does not clearly display three distinct rock formations as seen in traditional depictions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are footprints and ripple patterns visible in the wet sand near the waterâ€™s edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's artistic style employs lines and shapes to form various patterns. However, it does not distinctly represent footprints or sand ripples when compared to conventional depictions. These elements are absent in the abstract design that focuses more on stylized representations of the environment.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the coastline visible as a curved line extending into the distance, with green hills rising behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases abstract lines that can be interpreted as a coastline curving into the distance. However, the presence of green hills as a recognizable form is not directly apparent due to the more stylized approach to depicting landscape features. The lines and shapes do imply depth suggestive of a coastline extending into the distance, yet not explicitly showing green hills.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the sky visible above the horizon, featuring clouds with warm orange and pink tones near the horizon and transitioning to blue higher up?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the upper part of the composition transitions with warmer tones, aligning with a simplified depiction of a sky transitioning from warm hues near the horizon to different shades higher up. Although not distinctly showing clouds, the color transitions and arrangement suggest abstract interpretation of sky colors similar to those described.",
