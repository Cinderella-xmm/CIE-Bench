    "Question": "Q2: Is the Qatari Riyal note with its pink-orange hue, Arabic script, and serial number '103 01' present and recognizable?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a banknote with a pink-orange hue and what seems to be Arabic script visible, suggesting it could be a Qatari Riyal. World knowledge states that Qatari Riyal notes often feature Arabic scripts and similar color tones, which are partially visible in the wallet. However, the serial number '103 01' is not discernible due to image limitations, but given the visible colors and script, the note is recognizable. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is the Indian Rupee 50 note with the lion capital symbol and yellow-brown color clearly visible?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a portion of a banknote with a design that might suggest hints of logos or symbols is visible, but the dominant color is not clearly yellow-brown, and no distinct lion capital symbol is identifiable due to limited visibility and image clarity. Given these observations, the Indian Rupee 50 note is not clearly visible. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the U.S. $1 bill with the portrait of George Washington and 'ONE DOLLAR' text present?",
    "explanation": "Image B does exhibit a banknote with green tones, which hints at American currency, but lacks any distinguishing features such as the portrait of George Washington or 'ONE DOLLAR' text. The visual information is insufficient to conclude the presence of a U.S. $1 bill. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.",

    "Question": "Q5: Are all four banknotes (U.S. $20, Qatari Riyal, Indian Rupee 50, U.S. $1) present together in the same visual space?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, we can identify banknotes resembling the U.S. $20 and Qatari Riyal based on their distinctive colors and partial details. However, there is no clear, identifiable evidence of the Indian Rupee 50 note or the U.S. $1 bill, given the inability to see distinct features belonging to them. Hence, not all four banknotes are present together clearly. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the original dominant colors of the banknotes (green for USD, pink-orange for QAR, yellow-brown for INR) preserved?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the visible banknotes do maintain their respective color schemes as typically recognized. The U.S. $20 bill shows shades of green, the Qatari Riyal exhibits pink-orange hues, and there is an attempt to represent other notes, although not clearly defined due to visibility hindrances. However, the editing does seem to preserve these dominant colors as known from the real banknotes. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.",
    "answer": "Yes"
