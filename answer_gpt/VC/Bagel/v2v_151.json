      "question": "Does the tiger retain its distinctive stripe pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature has the appearance of a chibi or cartoon-style tiger character. Real tigers are known for their distinctive vertical black stripes on a background of orange-brown fur. The character in Image B has simplified cartoon stripes, which are consistent with common depictions of tigers in a stylized manner. Therefore, considering the artistic representation, the stripes are simplified but the essential concept of a tiger's stripe pattern remains.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi tiger character does not have any items or accessories in its paws. It stands in a playful or neutral pose often associated with such types of stylized figures. The absence of any visible skateboard or object held by the character suggests it is not holding anything.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the chibi tiger is not holding a skateboard, nor is there any visible skateboard present. Therefore, there's no indication of a yin-yang symbol on any object in view since the skateboard itself is absent.",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi tiger character does not appear to wear any headgear or hat. The head is devoid of any military-style cap or similar accessory, which would have been an easily identifiable feature if present.",
