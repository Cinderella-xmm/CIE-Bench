      "question": "Does the butterfly retain its original iridescent electric blue wing color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's wings are illustrated in a similar shade of blue to those in Image A, suggesting that its electric blue color is retained. The drawing represents the key attributes of the butterfly's wings, seemingly capturing the iridescent quality as both images maintain a vibrant blue color. Thus, the butterfly's wing color appears to have been preserved between the images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the dark black edges along the outer margins of the butterflyâ€™s wings preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The second image shows the butterfly's wings with pronounced black edges, resembling those in the first image. This suggests that the dark black edges on the wings' outer margins are preserved. Given the drawing's attention to detail in maintaining these borders, it's logical to conclude the answer is affirmative.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the butterfly depicted with both wings fully extended and symmetrically open?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration in Image B depicts the butterfly with both wings symmetrically extended, much like in Image A. The attention to symmetry and the prominent display of both wings in a fully open position makes it apparent that the depiction remains consistent across images.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bright pink cosmos flower directly beneath the butterfly still present and clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an illustration of a pink flower beneath the butterfly, but it is not in the same natural form as observed in Image A. Instead, it appears simplified and stylized, indicating that while a flower is present, it may not be the same bright pink cosmos flower seen directly underneath the butterfly in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the yellow stamens forming the central disc of the pink flower visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although Image B does depict a pink flower, it is a stylized illustration and does not show any detailed stamen structure within the flower. In Image A, yellow stamens are clearly visible, but this detail is not replicated in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the butterfly physically touching the surface of the pink flower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the illustration (Image B), the butterfly is depicted above the flower for educational purposes rather than in a photographic context like Image A, where the butterfly appears perched on the flower. The layout and educational focus suggest the butterfly isn't depicted as touching the flower in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "question": "Are multiple unopened pink flower buds visible around the main flower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The second image focuses on illustrating a butterfly and certain biological characteristics but does not depict a natural setting with multiple flower buds as in Image A, which has unopened buds surrounding the main flower.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the background composed of softly blurred green leaves, maintaining a natural garden ambiance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a stylized educational illustration that doesn't focus on providing a natural ambiance or background. In contrast, Image A features a natural setting with softly blurred green leaves suggesting a garden. The illustration in Image B lacks this natural background.",
