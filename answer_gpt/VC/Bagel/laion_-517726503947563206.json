      "question": "Is the text \"Aurora\" visible on the side of the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship is visually analyzed and identified as an intricate crystal-like structure, differing from a conventional ship design. It lacks typical ship markings or textual features, such as the word 'Aurora,' which cannot be discerned. Unlike Image A, where textual details can be observed, the edited image transforms the ship into a detailed artistic representation, omitting such textual elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the registration number \"QV-8880\" visible on the hull of the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a reimagined version of the ship, creatively crafted using a crystal motif, devoid of conventional registration numbers like 'QV-8880.' The visually complex design masks specific identifiable textual information, unlike Image A, where the registration is visible on a traditional ship hull.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is a red flag visible at the top of the ship’s mast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the absence of a discernible mast structure or flag, such as a red flag, particularly at the top, is noticed. The ship's design is primarily focused on an imaginative crystalline appearance, different from Image A, which presents a traditional ship design with a visible red flag atop the mast.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the ship oriented in a side profile view, facing toward the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the ship in a distinctive side profile facing toward the right side, reflecting the same orientation as seen in Image A. The unique crystal ship design maintains this orientation, adhering to conventional ship positioning seen in photographs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visual analysis of Image B confirms the ship's placement on a body of water, as indicated by the water surrounding its base, consistent with maritime context and buoyancy typical of ships, paralleled with Image A where the ship is explicitly shown afloat water.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Is the ship positioned near the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B places the artistic representation of the ship prominently near the center, which corresponds with Image A’s composition wherein the ship is also centrally aligned. This placement draws viewer attention to the ship as the primary feature of the image.",
