    "Question": "Q1: Is the capybara’s snout shape — including the rounded nose, wide mouth, and visible teeth — preserved in the sculpture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a bronze sculpture of a helmet with the face blurred. Based on this, a sculpture designed as a helmet would generally not feature characteristic animal elements such as a snout or mouth. The snout shape specific to a capybara would include a rounded nose, wide mouth, and visible teeth, which are not typically present in a helmet. Thus, these elements are not preserved in the sculpture.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the white muzzle area, positioned centrally on the face and extending from the nose to the upper lip, preserved in the sculpture?",
    "explanation": "The sculpture, in Image B, is a helmet with no visible animal facial features such as muzzles or specific colorations. The white muzzle area of a capybara would be a specific feature of an animal's face and is unlikely to be replicated on a helmet design.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the whiskers present and arranged in the same radial pattern from the snout as in the original image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture does not depict features typical to a capybara, such as whiskers arranged radially from the snout, as helmets generally demonstrate smooth surfaces without fine details like whiskers.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the glasses positioned directly over the eyes, with the frame aligned horizontally across the bridge of the nose?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture is a bronze helmet and does not feature glasses. Glasses are typically positioned over the eyes of a creature, but since the helmet does not include the face, frames cannot be positioned as such.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the sweater and shoulder straps positioned on the shoulders and torso in the same way as in the original image?",
    "explanation": "The object in Image B is a bronze helmet with no depiction of clothing such as a sweater or shoulder straps. These items are specific to a capybara ensemble not replicated in a sculpture intended to replicate armor.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the capybara’s head shape — rounded, broad, and proportionally large relative to the body — preserved in the sculpture?",
    "explanation": "The sculpture, being a helmet, does not display a head shaped as rounded or broad like a capybara's. Helmets are designed for human head shapes and purposes, not to replicate specific animal features proportionally relating to a capybara's body.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the mouth depicted as slightly open, revealing the teeth, in the same manner as the original?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, being a helmet, there is no depiction of a mouth that could be slightly open or reveal teeth. Helmets typically feature a closed face without depiction of open mouths or visible teeth.",
    "answer": "No"
