      "question": "Is the complex scrollwork and floral engraving pattern visible on the body, lid, and spout of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object shown is a candle with a smooth wax surface without any intricate patterns. Instead, there are simple floral designs and inscriptions on the lower part of the candle. Common scrollwork and floral engravings typically involve intricate patterns covering larger areas, which are not present on this candle. Thus, based on visual observation and common pattern knowledge, the answer is No.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the object have a domed lid topped with a small finial at the apex?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a candle with a flat surface and a burning wick on top, without any lid or finial. A finial is a decorative top piece often found on lids, which does not apply to the candle. Therefore, the analysis based on object characteristics suggests the answer is No.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the object supported by a three-legged pedestal base with decorative feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The candle in Image B is shown with a flat circular base, characteristic of simple candle holders, resting directly on the surface. There are no visible legs or feet beneath it. Thus, examining the base design common in candles leads to the answer No.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a curved handle attached to the left side of the object, extending upward and backward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a candle with a decorative handle-like feature on the side, mimicking the style of teapot handles. The handle extends elegantly upward and backward in a curved fashion. Therefore, aligning with typical handle design knowledge, the answer is Yes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a long, curved spout extending from the right side of the objectâ€™s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The candle in Image B does not have a spout. The shape is cylindrical with no extensions resembling a spout. Spouts are typically found in teapots or pouring vessels, not candles. Thus, visual cues combined with object functionality knowledge suggest the answer is No.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a candle on a surface that appears to be smooth, but not clearly a polished wooden surface nor does it showcase any reflection beneath it. Candle holders often sit on straightforward surfaces without reflective features. The lack of distinctive reflections or wooden characteristics visually indicates the answer is No.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there decorative metal fittings where the handle attaches to the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a candle with a gold-colored decorative element that resembles a handle fused directly onto the candle's side. The nature of decorative metal fittings often includes visible joining or embellishment, which is subtly present in this design. Therefore, recognizing accessory attachment norms, the answer is Yes.",
