    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the red roof of the house located on the left side of the peninsula still visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a red-roofed structure visible in the foreground near the bottom of the peninsula. The presence of various colored buildings can also be noted, indicating a change in the area from the original Image A. This suggests the original object has been altered but not removed.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the long black building situated near the center-right of the peninsula still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show the long black building that was clearly visible near the center-right of the peninsula in Image A. The addition of artistic elements in the edited image has changed the landscape features.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the golden-brown grasslands covering the peninsula still visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vibrant colors of golden-brown grasslands seen in Image A are obscured by the presence of a large, artistic dragon. This changes the focus and visibility of the original landscape features.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the surface of the lake is represented with stylized artistic effects suggesting water movement rather than patches of ice visible in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,

      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain background maintains detailed features, including snow streaks on its slopes, as in Image A. The artistic rendering has kept these features consistent.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the red-roofed house positioned to the left of the black barn along the peninsula?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the red-roofed houses in Image B appear distinct and differently positioned, and the black barn is not discernible. Therefore, the relative positioning of the black barn with the red-roofed building from Image A is not maintained in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the image retain the original color scheme of blue sky, white snow, brown grass, and red roof?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B introduces vibrant artistic features that alter the perception of the natural color scheme seen in Image A. The blue sky and white snow are still present, but stylized colors take precedence affecting the cohesive original color scheme.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the peninsula shaped in a winding, snake-like curve extending from the shore into the lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the peninsula shows a distinct winding, snake-like shape. Image B retains this form even amid the artistic modifications, as the peninsula's shape continues to curve into the lake.",
