      "question": "Are the toasters still rectangular with a smooth metallic finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toasters retain their rectangular shape with a smooth metallic finish which is identifiable by the consistent shiny surface and smooth edges typical of metal. There is no indication of a change in material or shape based on the visual cues in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the bread still rising slightly above the toaster slots with visible toast marks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bread is shown protruding above the toaster slots, with distinct toast marks indicating browning or heating, which is typical of toasted bread. This visual suggests that the bread is still in a similar position to what would be expected from a toaster.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the black control knobs and levers still present on the toasters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toasters clearly display black control knobs and levers, which are essential parts of a toaster for adjusting and controlling its functions. The presence of these features is consistent with a standard toaster design and matches the visible black elements in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the toasters retain their reflective metallic sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) displays the toasters with a reflective surface, indicating a metallic sheen. This observation is supported by the way the light appears to reflect off their surfaces, characteristic of metallic materials.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the two toasters still placed side by side on the same surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two toasters are visually positioned next to each other on a common surface, which appears to be a makeshift outdoor setup, perhaps for a picnic. Despite the change in the environment, their relative positioning suggests they remain side by side.",
