    "Question": "Q1: Is there a long, continuous road-like structure extending into the distance, serving as the central axis of the composition?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the prominent feature that catches the eye is a road-like structure extending straight into the distance, acting as the central axis. This is evidenced by the clearly delineated stripes resembling road markings, and the symmetry of the composition suggests the presence of some form of path or road. The visual symmetry and perspective in the image support this conclusion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there visible diagonal streaks or patterns indicating falling rain across the scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, rather than realistic streaks indicating rain, there are geometric patterns consisting of triangles and polygon shapes. These don't represent rain visually or stylistically. The abstract nature of the image means this element isn't portrayed in a traditional or identifiable manner, thus indicating the absence of rain.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there tall vertical structures with horizontal crossbars positioned along the right side of the road?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases abstract vertical elements that resemble power lines, consisting of poles with crossbars positioned along the right side. The regular spacing and structural style simulate utility poles that are often aligned alongside roads.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there tree-like forms present on both sides of the road, aligned with the guardrails?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, rather than realistic trees, there are triangular forms that abstractly symbolize trees. These geometric identifiers are positioned in an arrangement that aligns them conceptually along the road, serving as a symbolic representation rather than true-to-life forms.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a visible division in the sky between dark clouds and a brighter, illuminated area near the horizon?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a section of abstract polygon shapes that suggest higher contrast in color near the horizon. These abstract representations could indicate an area of illumination but without the realistic cloud representation as seen in traditional images.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there barrier-like structures running along both edges of the road?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not contain explicit or tangible representation of barriers running alongside the road. The abstract composition consists of simplified shapes which don't suggest or mimic barriers clearly, leaving the impression ambiguous.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is there a continuous yellow line running down the center of the road?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central axis exhibits a definitive triangular shape that could represent a continuous road marking in abstract form, appearing primarily yellow. The elongated nature mimics the idea of a continuous line, indicative of road markings.",
    "answer": "Yes"
