      "question": "Is the butterfly still positioned centrally in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is depicted with a central positioning. Observing the image, the butterfly is placed equidistant from the edges and serves as a focal point, similar to how objects are frequently positioned to draw immediate attention in an image. This central placement suggests intentional emphasis and symmetry. Therefore, the butterfly remains in the central position.",

      "question": "Does the butterfly retain its blue color theme, even if reinterpreted as energy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly appears to be depicted as a glowing, energy-like figure but retains the blue color scheme. This depiction uses bright and neon-like shades of blue, consistent with energy or electrical representation commonly used in visual media. The transition from solid blue in Image A to the vibrant energy representation in Image B maintains the color theme.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the dark silhouette below the butterfly retain its general rugged shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dark area below the butterfly shows a curved and irregular pattern that resembles rocks or stones, distinctly different from the flat and straight silhouette in Image A. The original silhouette in Image A is rugged with sharp lines, whereas in Image B, it is more rounded and smooth, indicating a significant change in shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the butterfly still depicted as hovering above the dark silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly, represented as an energy form, is positioned above a dark, textured, rock-like surface. This placement visually indicates hovering or floating, similar to Image A where the butterfly is above the silhouette. Thus, despite the changes in depiction style, the butterfly maintains its position above the lower section.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the dark silhouette below the butterfly retain its dark color contrast with the butterfly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a contrast between the bright blue luminescent butterfly and the dark, rocky surface below it. This contrast is similar to Image A, where there is a distinct color differentiation between the blue butterfly and the black silhouette. This color contrast is consistent in both images.",
