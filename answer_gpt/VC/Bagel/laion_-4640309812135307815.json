      "question": "Is the woman’s hairstyle still platinum blonde with shoulder-length soft waves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's hairstyle retains the visual characteristics of being platinum blonde with soft waves that reach shoulder length, as indicated by the consistent color and style. Without needing to refer to external knowledge, the hairstyle appears unchanged between the two images, which is supported by comparing Image A's and Image B's hairstyle attributes.",

      "question": "Does the woman still have bright red lipstick applied to her lips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the only changes observed are related to the dress and accessories. Without focusing on the face, which is blurred out, the question's specification on lipstick color cannot be visually confirmed or denied directly. Since the face is blurred, this question cannot be factually supported based on visual analysis. Thus, the answer defaults to acknowledging no visible change.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the background features vertical black slats with horizontal copper lines, consistent across both images as identifiable background decor. These structural elements are clearly visible and unchanged, forming a backdrop for the photographic setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's right hand holds an object that resembles a card or invitation, not the small red clutch seen in Image A. The clutch has been visually replaced by this new element, indicating a deliberate change in hand-held accessories.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the woman is pictured holding hands with the man on the right. This consistent pose is a notable feature, providing continuity between images not impacted by the dress or accessory edits.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower part of the woman's dress has been edited to resemble a stylized fragrance bottle shape, which suggests continuity in the elongated, flowing silhouette, though with adjustments to serve its new graphical role.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the dress has been altered to a bottle shape, the predominant color throughout remains red, mirroring the original hue in Image A. Despite the added white detailing, the primary visual color persists as red, confirming this observation.",
