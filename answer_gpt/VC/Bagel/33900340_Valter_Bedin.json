    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the central archway positioned at the center of the main structure, forming a passageway between the two vertical pillars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, what appears to be the central archway in Image A has been replaced by a large, abstract figure. This figure is positioned where the central archway was in Image A, indicating its original position in the structure. Despite the transformation in appearance, the location suggests that the archway was indeed centrally positioned between what originally were two vertical pillars. Therefore, even though the archway is no longer visible, based on the positioning, it was central.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the two vertical pillars standing symmetrically on either side of the central archway, forming a tall, narrow gateway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, symmetrical vertical structures still stand on either side of where the original archway would have been. However, these structures are now part of the figure that replaced the archway. Based on the original image's design and unchanged elements in Image B, it's reasonable to deduce that they still maintain symmetry. Therefore, even though the central element has changed, the structures are still symmetrical.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the battlements along the top of the structure composed of repeating rectangular merlons and gaps (crenels)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the top of the structure features battlements with clearly defined rectangular merlons and gaps, also known as crenels. Image B retains this detail from Image A, showing a repeated pattern typically seen in fortifications.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a long, low brick wall running parallel to the main structure on the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a long, low wall runs parallel to the main structure on the left side, similar to what is seen in Image A. The parallel positioning remains unchanged despite other edits in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a paved pathway extending from the foreground toward the central archway, running between the low wall and the main structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains a visual representation of a pathway extending from the foreground toward what was the central archway, situated between the low wall and now the transformed main structure. The pathway's linear direction and placement between these elements mirror the original setup in Image A, suggesting continuity.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there additional arched openings visible to the right of the main central archway, integrated into the same wall structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no additional arched openings visible to the right of the main central space, which now features a large figure. Any previous details present in Image A are obscured or replaced in Image B, indicating the absence of such visible structures.",
      "weight": 1,

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the small human figure located on the pathway, positioned behind the viewer and moving toward the central archway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the small human figure is on the pathway and visually positioned as moving toward the area that in Image A would have been the central archway. The figure's location on the pathway and movement direction is consistent in both images, indicating that in Image B the figure is indeed moving toward the central region of the scene.",
