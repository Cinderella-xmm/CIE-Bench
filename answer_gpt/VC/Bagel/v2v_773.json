      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apple forms the heads of the figurine, with two eye-like cutouts, resembling more a stylized apple without the seed visible. The design is intended to give a playful, whimsical look rather than focusing on the natural details of an apple's cross-section.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
