      "question": "Does the plastic figurine still hold a hammer that glows with blue lightning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object held by the figurine does not visibly emit blue lightning. Instead, it has a uniform, opaque blue tonal appearance. Visual cues suggest it doesn’t have lighting effects, typical of non-illuminated, solid materials like plastic or resin. Such glow is absent, indicating no dynamic lighting feature in the edited figurine.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the detailed black armor with metallic and gold accents retained on the figurine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the figurine with similar armor styling as Image A, featuring black as the primary color accentuated by gold elements. This suggests that the figurine's design preserves the intricate detailing and colors presenting a miniaturized but analogous aesthetic to Image A’s armor.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the figurine still wear a red cape draped over the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual evidence in Image B clearly shows a red cape on the figurine's shoulders, which is consistent with Thor's character design. This indicates that the edited figure keeps the cape similar to the original design's elements, confirming its retention.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the figurine retain Thor's beard and long blond hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine possesses long blond hair, coherent with Thor’s characteristic hairstyle. However, there’s no portrayal or emphasis on a beard present on the figurine, differing from standard Thor representations suggesting image edits focus on hair rather than beard retention.",

      "question": "Does the figurine maintain the same standing pose as depicted in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images show a similar upright standing posture, with the figure’s design indicating arms placed downward holding an object (hammer). Despite the lack of dynamic posing typical to action figures, it was intended to capture a statically heroic stance parallel to Image A.",
