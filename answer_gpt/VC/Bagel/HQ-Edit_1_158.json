    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the woman’s silver hair clearly visible and styled in a short, neat manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is depicted as a silhouette with no visible details of hair color or style. The silhouette outlines the hair tied up in a bun, which does not reveal the hair being styled in a short or especially neat manner in the traditional visual sense. The style appears more traditional or generic due to the silhouette depiction.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both hands visibly holding the open book, with fingers wrapped around the edges of the pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman holds a book but, being a silhouette, her fingers and other details are not visible. The outlines do not provide any indication of fingers wrapping around the edges of the pages since silhouettes only show shape and not intricate details such as individual fingers.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a tabby cat sitting on the red rug in the lower-right corner, facing upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is entirely on the woman silhouette, and there is no detail or inclusion of a cat. A silhouette primarily shows one feature without additional elements like a pet present in the composition.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the armchair have a high backrest, padded arms, and visible wooden legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks detailed depictions of furniture since only the silhouette of the woman is included, meaning there are no visible features of an armchair with a high backrest, padded arms, or wooden legs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a stack of five books on the floor to the left of the chair, with a white mug resting on top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, as a silhouette style artwork, additional objects or details like books or a white mug cannot be discerned since the focus remains only on the woman's shape, excluding any background or surrounding objects.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a white mug on the small wooden side table to the right of the woman?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, in silhouette form, restricts visibility to the woman reading a book; hence, no furniture or objects such as a mug on a table can be identified.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a beige knitted blanket with lace-like patterns draped over the woman’s lap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette shows a hint of a detailed pattern, possibly simulating clothing lace or design. However, it does not specifically reflect a knitted texture or a specific color like beige, as color and texture details are absent in silhouettes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the woman seated upright with a slight forward lean, facing the viewer while reading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, being a silhouette, the stance can suggest an upright seated position, potentially with a forward lean indicating engagement in reading. However, the direction of facing the viewer cannot be confirmed strictly due to the lack of facial or directional details.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
