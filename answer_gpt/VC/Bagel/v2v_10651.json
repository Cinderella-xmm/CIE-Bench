      "question": "Is the diamond-cut pattern on the decanter preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the decanter's surface has an abstracted pattern that resembles the original diamond-cut design but is not as detailed or clear as in Image A. The pattern is more sculpted and less defined due to the clay-like texture. This indicates an attempt to mimic the pattern but not retain its precision.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the white foam layer present on top of the liquid in the glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass appears more abstract and it's difficult to discern a liquid surface with a visible foam layer. The top of the glass is smooth and lacks the distinctive white foam observed in Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are visible flames and glowing embers present in the fireplace in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fireplace does show visible flames and some indications of glowing embers, though they are stylized and less detailed compared to Image A. The warm colors in the fireplace suggest the presence of flames.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bottle opener shaped with a D-shaped opening and a long handle, matching its original form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle opener retains a rough shape that suggests a D-shaped opening and handle. However, the details are less refined, giving a more amorphous look not precisely matching the original form, but closely representing it.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the decanter positioned to the right of the glass, with the opener placed in front of both?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the abstract representation, the general composition is similar to that in Image A, with the decanter on the right and the opener visually placed in front of both items, maintaining the original positioning.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the wooden table surface with visible grain texture present beneath the objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface beneath the objects appears smooth and lacks the detailed wooden grain texture visible in Image A. The surface is featureless, resembling a clay-like texture rather than a wooden table.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the liquid level in the glass approximately near the rim, and in the decanter about halfway up?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents abstract renditions where liquid levels are not clearly delineated. The glass appears empty and the decanter does not distinctly show a liquid level, contrasting with Image A where these levels are distinct.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the brick pattern surrounding the fireplace visible and intact in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brick pattern is abstract yet present around the fireplace, maintaining a semblance of the original structure but with softer detailing, implying a preservation of the pattern.",
