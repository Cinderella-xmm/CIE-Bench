      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, analyzed independently, the elephant shows prominent large ears and a distinct trunk, both commonly recognized features of an elephant. This conclusion is drawn from observing the detailed depiction of these features in the edited image, which aligns with a typical elephant's anatomy.",

      "question": "Is the hat placed on top of the elephant's head and the collar around its neck in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a yellow hat positioned on top of the elephant’s head and a red collar around its neck. This is inferred from the visual cues where these accessories are clearly depicted in a way that aligns with common depictions of such attire positioning.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the edited image, the elephant’s eyes are colored black. This is straightforwardly observed from the image where the eye color is distinctly depicted as black, matching typical cartoon or chibi representations.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the elephant is seen facing directly forward, as can be deduced from the symmetrical placement of features such as the eyes, trunk, and ears, all positioned to imply a front-facing orientation.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall shape of the elephant in the edited image does not resemble the original block-style model. The edited image depicts a more rounded and smooth form typical of a cartoon elephant, as compared to the angular, blocky construction of the original model made of interlocking pieces.",
