    "Question": "Q1: Is the calico pattern of orange, black, and white patches preserved in the same spatial arrangement across the catâ€™s body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is represented as a crystal structure with brown and black shades rather than distinct calico patches found in real cats. The spatial arrangement does not show the pattering typical of a calico cat's fur, which is composed of orange, black, and white patches across the body. Therefore, the spatial arrangement characteristic of calico cats is not preserved.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the eyes still green and positioned symmetrically in the center of the face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cat has green crystal eyes which are symmetrically positioned at the center of its face, similar to natural placement in real animals.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the cat in an upright seated position with both front paws placed directly in front of the body?",
    "explanation": "Based on the Image B, the crystal cat structure maintains an upright seated position with the crystal representations of paws placed directly in front, which mimics a sitting cat posture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the pink nose present at the center of the face, surrounded by white fur on the muzzle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's nose is represented by a green crystal, differing from the natural pink color found in real cats, and is centrally located on the face but not surrounded by white fur.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the cat seated on a vertical wooden block that supports its full weight?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal cat is seated on a wooden base, which seems to support its full structure, analogous to how the cat in Image A is seated on a wooden block.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the tail curled to the right side and displaying alternating orange and black bands consistent with the body pattern?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the tail as crystal segments without distinct color bands seen on a calico cat's fur. The tail appears to be segmented or faceted but does not display alternating orange and black bands.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are both ears upright and pointed forward, symmetrically placed on the top of the head?",
    "explanation": "The crystal cat in Image B has facets that mimic ears, which are upright and symmetrically placed on the top of the head, pointing slightly forward, similar to real cats.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Is there a large white fluffy area on the chest extending from the neck down to the front paws?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal representation does not depict fluffy fur. Instead, it shows an abstract form of the cat's body without a distinct fluffy white area extending from the neck down to the paws.",
    "answer": "No"
