      "question": "Are the red, gray, and navy blue sections of the comforter present in the edited image, preserving their original color distribution?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original comforter's color sections with red, gray, and navy blue are completely modified. The comforter is replaced by a patchwork quilt with various colors, making the original color distribution unrecognizable. This observation is based on the visual cues where the colors and patterns are different, showing a creative alteration from the original design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the small square plaid pillow (with red, navy, and white checks) still present on the bed, positioned near the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show the small square plaid pillow initially present in Image A. Instead, the bed features large leafy ears, which significantly alter the visual setup of the bed. This indicates that the original pillow is replaced or removed, as evidenced by the absence of its distinct plaid pattern and its substitution with larger elements instead.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the pillows remain positioned on top of the comforter, maintaining their original stacking order and placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the pillows are not visible on the bed. Instead, there is a patchwork quilt with auxiliary features like large ears on the bed, suggesting a complete makeover or removal of the pillows seen in Image A. The visual cues show discrepancies in shape and form, indicating a change in bedding accessories.",

      "question": "Is the light gray shag rug still present beneath the bed, covering the floor in front of it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, there is a light gray shag rug visible on the floor in front of the bed, maintaining its presence and position as seen initially. World knowledge of common room setups, where rugs are often stationary items unless thoroughly redecorated, assists in verifying this unchanged feature.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black tripod floor lamp with its white drum shade is visible in Image B at the same location as in Image A, to the left of the bed. Its unchanged position and appearance are identifiable through visual cues where the lamp structure remains consistent across both images. This reflects a preservation of certain room elements despite alterations in other areas.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual setup of the right side of the bed still includes the wooden nightstand, books, red lantern, and green plant, unchanged from Image A. This observation leverages common setups for bedside nightstands, indicating that these items are consistently maintaining their position and decor despite other imaginative alterations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background elements in both images, featuring a light gray wall and medium-toned wooden floor, remain unchanged. This is confirmed through consistent visual cues where these structural components of the room are identical, lacking any alterations despite changes to the bed setup. Room shells often stay constant unless specific interior remodeling occurs, which isn't represented here.",
