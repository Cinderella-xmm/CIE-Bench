    "Question": "Q1: Are there exactly four rotor assemblies arranged symmetrically around the central body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a robotic-like creature with multiple limbs, which appear to be part of its design rather than rotor assemblies. These limbs are not symmetrical or uniform like drone rotors. It’s more akin to an animated robot or creature with appendages rather than a mechanical drone. Thus, there are not four symmetrical rotor assemblies as one would expect from a traditional drone.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are there yellow triangular markings present on the top and side surfaces of the central body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robotic creature does not feature yellow triangular markings. Its color palette includes shades of metallic gray and blue, which are consistent with a robotic or sci-fi theme. The absence of yellow triangular markings on the surface contrasts the visual design commonly found on drones, which may include such patterns for aesthetic or functional purposes.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the landing supports shaped like V-forms at each corner of the drone?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a creature with spider-like legs rather than landing supports typical of a drone. These legs are angular, ending in sharp points, and they support the creature in a way reminiscent of a spider crawling rather than a drone landing. Typically, drone landing supports would be uniform and functional, providing stability upon landing, as opposed to the detailed and elaborate limbs seen here.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the central body feature sharp, angular edges and a polygonal structure?",
    "explanation": "The central body of the object in Image B does indeed feature sharp, angular edges and a polygonal structure. It resembles a sci-fi metallic skull with distinct architectural designs typical of futuristic or alien machinery, emphasizing a menacing and complex geometric form.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there three small rectangular lights aligned horizontally on the top surface of the central body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the feature that might be analogous to lights is the glowing blue elements that resemble eyes and possibly other glowing components. These are not small rectangular lights aligned horizontally; instead, they are large, central, and prominent, contributing to the creature’s intimidating appearance rather than merely decorative or functional lights.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the drone predominantly black with yellow accent markings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the predominant colors of the robotic creature are metallic gray and blue, with no evident yellow accent markings. This color palette supports the theme of futuristic or robotic imagery rather than a traditional drone design with specific black and yellow color schemes.",
    "answer": "No"
