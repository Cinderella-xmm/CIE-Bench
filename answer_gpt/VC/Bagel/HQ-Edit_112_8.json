      "question": "Is the ornate embossed pattern on the typewriter’s base clearly visible and preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the typewriter exhibits a design typical of vintage models, characterized by intricate patterns and embossing that enhance its aesthetic appeal. The image showcases this embossing on the typewriter’s base, indicative of detailed craftsmanship, and it's visibly preserved, suggesting the effort to maintain historical authenticity. Recognition of such patterns draws from world knowledge of historical typewriter designs known for ornate details.",

      "question": "Are the cylindrical metal keys arranged in a QWERTY layout with visible spacing and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the typewriter has cylindrical metal keys, a common characteristic of older typewriters. The QWERTY layout, known to be the standard arrangement for typewriters, ensures ease of typing and efficiency. Observing the spacing and depth of keys allows us to recognize these details. Thus, analyzing Image B's keyboard, which appears to follow the QWERTY layout, involves understanding these design purposes and typographic conventions.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a blank sheet of paper inserted into the typewriter’s roller mechanism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roller mechanism of the typewriter holds a sheet of paper with text on it, evident from the visible written lines suggesting ongoing work or drafting. The presence of paper aligns with the functionality of typewriters where text is directly typed onto paper. Hence, Image B doesn't show a blank sheet, but rather pages with text.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the ceramic mug with a visible logo or design present on the desk to the left of the typewriter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature additional objects such as a ceramic mug to the left of the typewriter. The focus remains on the typewriter and its vintage elements. Recognizing this absence involves understanding the minimalism inherent in classical illustrative art, where additional items must contribute to the theme or be intentionally integrated.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the table lamp with a beige fabric shade and classical columnar base positioned to the left of the typewriter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the typewriter is the centerpiece without additional items like a table lamp. Classical illustrations often focus intensely on one main object, omitting extraneous items unless crucial to the narrative or theme. Therefore, recognizing that Image B is concentrated and doesn't extend beyond its subject indicates the absence of a lamp.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the wooden desk surface with natural wood grain and light reflection clearly visible beneath the typewriter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a desk is present supporting the typewriter. However, rather than detailed emphasis on wood grain and lighting – elements expected in photorealistic images – this illustration celebrates the vintage aesthetic surrounding the typewriter. Thus, wood grain details aren't depicted prominently, and instead patina effects typical in stylized works prevail.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B does not feature walls with decorative elements like landscape paintings. The illustration's focus remains purely on the typewriter, a common artistic choice to emphasize singular thematic objects. Such exclusion of detailed settings from the background reinforces the central typewriter's significance, not extending to paintings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any wall-mounted decorations like clocks. The focus is entirely on the vintage typewriter in stylized presentation, not extended to additional illustrative detail like clocks. This concentration, typical in illustrated works aiming to communicate a specific theme or object, results in excluding peripheral items.",
