      "question": "Does the handbag retain the organic, wood-like texture seen in the original brain sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture appears to be more smooth and less fibrous, indicating a shift away from an organic, wood-like texture to a more polished look. The visual cues such as sheen and surface finishing do not imply wood-like texture. Image A displays a rustic, fibrous texture typical of wood, whereas Image B looks polished and possibly synthetic, suggesting a different material or finish.",

      "question": "Is the handbag designed with an earthy color palette, including shades of brown and beige?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible colors are primarily various shades of brown and beige, closely resembling natural, earthy tones. These colors commonly evoke a sense of earthiness, suggesting the palette is consistently earthy. Image A similarly displays shades of brown and beige, indicating that the edited image maintains the original image's color scheme.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the inscription 'profound musings' prominently placed on what appears to be a raised area, similar to Image A. The font style and size in Image B match those of Image A, with both inscriptions aligned in the same area that corresponds to the brain's frontal region.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays detailed, dense grooves that mimic the brain's sulci-gyrus pattern seen in natural brain anatomy, and which were present in Image A. This intricate detailing making up the brain's structure is observable in both images, maintaining the complexity and sophistication of the original design.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a wooden base, much like the one seen in Image A, intended possibly as a supporting structure or a display stand. This wooden base provides a sturdy foundation, consistent with the original structure's support depicted in Image A.",
