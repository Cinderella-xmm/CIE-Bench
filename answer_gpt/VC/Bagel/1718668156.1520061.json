      "question": "Is the amber-colored liquid visible in the short glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a short glass containing an amber-colored liquid. The distinct amber hue can be seen through the clear glass, which is traditionally indicative of a beverage like iced tea or similar drinks. This visual cue, coupled with common knowledge about such drinks, supports the conclusion that the liquid is indeed amber-colored.",

      "question": "Is a yellow straw inserted into the short glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's a prominent yellow straw inserted into the short glass. The straw is visibly bright and stands out against the amber-colored liquid and ice cubes inside the glass. This observation is consistent with typical setups where straws are used for drinking cold beverages.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are ice cubes visible within the short glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, there are noticeable ice cubes within the short glass, which are apparent due to their translucent and faceted nature. They are seen floating in the amber liquid, which is commonly the way ice is presented in beverages to keep them cool.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tall glass completely filled with ice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tall glass has a substantial amount of ice, but it does not appear to be completely filled to the brim. Some areas near the top do not seem as densely packed with ice, suggesting space between ice pieces. Understanding typical drink presentation helps conclude it is not fully packed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an illustration resembling the iconic sail-like shells of the Sydney Opera House in a neon-like style. The image uses recognizable shapes and outlines that mimic the famous architectural design, helping identify it as the Sydney Opera House.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a scene with a stylized or abstract surface beneath the glasses, instead of a realistic stone ledge. The background is a synthetic, neon digital style, where traditional components like a stone ledge are replaced by graphic elements.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the two glasses positioned side by side on the ledge, with the short glass on the left and the tall glass on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the short glass is located to the left of the tall glass, indicating their relative positions. They are placed next to each other in the foreground, following a typical side-by-side arrangement one might expect for this kind of setup.",
