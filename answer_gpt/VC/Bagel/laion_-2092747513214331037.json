      "question": "Is the cyclist in a forward-leaning position with hands on aerobars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cyclist is depicted in a position typically associated with aerodynamic cycling stances. This involves leaning forward with hands resting on aerobars, guided by common cycling practices for reducing wind resistance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are two bicycles mounted vertically on the roof rack of the black car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car shown does not have bicycles mounted on its roof. Instead, visual design elements and futuristic aesthetics dominate the car's exterior, indicating an illustrative take rather than a representation of real entities.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a stylized, dynamic road environment with luminous and futuristic elements, lacking realistic and typical road markings such as white lane and yellow center lines. These are substituted with illustrative graphics consistent with the image's theme.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is characterized by enhanced lighting effects and a digital atmosphere rather than incorporating real-world objects such as traffic cones, which further supports its conceptual rather than realistic depiction.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car does not display any form of realistic license plate. Instead, the image conveys a futuristic style, omitting such mundane details in favor of highlighting enhanced digital features.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the cyclist riding parallel to the car on the same road?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a cyclist and a vehicle both in motion, with a stylized road beneath. However, the exact notion of parallel traveling on a shared real road isn't made distinctly clear due to the digital stylization of the scene.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's background is digitally created with dynamic lighting and simulated elements, lacking any portrayal of natural landscape features such as dry hills or sparse vegetation found in realistic settings.",
