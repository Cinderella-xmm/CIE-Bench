    "Question": "Q1: Do both players retain identifiable clothing (white shirts and shorts, white tank top with black bottoms) and hairstyles in the chibi version?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both players are portrayed in a cartoonish style, known as 'chibi,' which often simplifies features while maintaining identifiable elements. The player on the left wears an outfit with a predominantly white shirt and blue shorts, and a cap, similar to a modern athletic outfit. The player on the right wears a white top with a black skirt and has her hair tied back, resembling a tank top and athletic skirt combination. These elements closely match the outfits seen in their original depiction in an athletic setting, meaning identifiable clothing and hairstyles are retained in a simplified form.",

    "Question": "Q4: Are tennis balls and the net still present in the foreground and middle ground respectively?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi illustration focuses on the characters and does not explicitly depict tennis balls or a net in a detailed or realistic manner in the same way Image A does. The stylization and focus seem to exclude these items, emphasizing the handshake and the sport context without those specific background elements.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the background still depict an outdoor tennis court or at least retain visual hints of it (e.g., court lines, fencing)?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a stylized green circle with white lines that resemble tennis court lines, indicative of a tennis court graphic. However, it lacks the detailed realism of an actual outdoor tennis court, such as visible fencing or net posts. This stylization provides a hint of the tennis court environment without recreating the full outdoor setting shown in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
