      "question": "Is the cardinal’s body predominantly bright red with a black facial mask?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal is shown as a toy-like figure inside a box, which deviates from a realistic portrayal. The body is primarily bright red with no black facial mask. Typically, cardinals in realistic depictions have black masks around their beak area, but this stylized representation does not follow that pattern. Therefore, combining world knowledge about cardinals and visual cues from the edited image, the body of the cardinal in Image B is indeed predominantly bright red but lacks the typical black facial mask of a real cardinal.",

      "question": "Does the blue jay have a blue crest and wings with alternating blue and white bars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue jay is shown as a toy or model figure inside a box. Its wings maintain a pattern that somewhat resembles the natural alternating blue and white bars seen in real blue jays. Additionally, the blue crest is also present on the toy model. By combining this with world knowledge of blue jays and the stylized representation in Image B, the blue jay does possess a blue crest and wings with alternating blue and white bars.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal appears in a decorative box with a stylized depiction. There is no apparent snow on the cardinal's head or back. Typically, snow would appear as white accumulations on the bird if present, but in this toy-like representation, such details are omitted. Combining these observations with the design elements typical of this style in the illustration, there is no snow on the cardinal.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue jay depicted as a model inside a box has a black beak. This is consistent with the true coloration of blue jays, whose beaks are naturally black. The depiction in Image B aligns with the real characteristics of a blue jay's beak.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal and blue jay are positioned inside separate boxes as stylized models. There are no visible details of them being perched on snow-covered pine branches. Instead, they are placed on artificial snow-like surfaces with decoration. As such, the edited image does not depict the birds on snow-covered pine branches with visible needles.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal features a beak depicted in an orange-red hue, which is characteristic of actual cardinals. Despite the stylized portrayal, this detail aligns with the real-life coloring of a cardinal's beak, reaffirming that the beak color in the image is true to life.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal and blue jay are illustrated in two separate rectangular boxes, placed side by side horizontally rather than in vertical sections. Even though the boxes create separate spaces for each bird, they are aligned horizontally, not vertically. Understanding the layout and spatial arrangement in Image B, the birds are not in separate vertical sections.",
