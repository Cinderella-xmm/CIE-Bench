      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar's body displays a teal color, which matches the common perception of a teal hue as seen in everyday objects. The sound hole is depicted as circular, consistent with the design feature found in many traditional guitars. This visual cue aligns with common guitar design elements, confirming the presence of a teal-colored guitar with a circular sound hole.",

        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no microphone present near the guitar. Instead, the setting includes a figurative scene with a character and decorative elements, indicating a shift from the music performance setup in Image A to a playful, decorative depiction. This difference indicates that the microphone which was near the guitar in Image A is absent in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the environment has changed notably, with the introduction of a decorative arch and petals, and no amplifier is visible. This contrasts with Image A, where the amplifier is clearly positioned behind the guitar, setting a stage environment. The absence of an amplifier showcases a thematic change from performance to whimsical decoration.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar does not lean against an amplifier as depicted in Image A. Instead, the guitar is integrated into a figurative scene with a character holding it. The change in positioning from leaning on the amplifier to being held suggests a departure from the original scene setup.",
