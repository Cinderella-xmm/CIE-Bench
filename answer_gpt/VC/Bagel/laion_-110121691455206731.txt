    "Question": "Q1: Is the text 'MICHAEL KORS' present in uppercase letters below the 12 o'clock position on the dial?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, which depicts a comic-style illustration, the prominent focus is a large clock with humorous and nonsensical text, which does not feature any branding like 'MICHAEL KORS'. The entire image is stylized and clearly does not represent an actual watch. Therefore, the logical conclusion is that no luxury branding text such as 'MICHAEL KORS' appears on this clock. In comparison, Image A displays the branding 'MICHAEL KORS' on an actual watch, below the 12 o'clock position.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are there three subdials located at the 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions, with the 3 o'clock subdial marked 24-hour scale, the 6 o'clock subdial marked seconds, and the 9 o'clock subdial marked minutes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, examining the comic-style clock, only the basic hour and minute markers are visible without any subdial indicators. The illustration prioritizes humor and absurdity over functional detail, unlike a real watch. In Image A, however, the watch shows three subdials marking seconds, minutes, and 24-hour time as described, clearly exhibiting functional elements of a chronograph. Therefore, the absence of subdials in Image B leads to the conclusion.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a rectangular date window at the 4 o'clock position showing the number '18'?",
    "explanation": "Image B, drawn as a comic, presents a whimsical clock with details meant to evoke humor rather than actual functionality. No date window is discernible, unlike in Image A, which has a specific date window at the 4 o'clock position. The comical representation does not include real-time date markers; hence, there is no '18' displayed on the clock face.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the watch have a black leather strap with an embossed crocodile texture and visible stitching along the edges?",
    "explanation": "Image B, being a comic-style image, does not represent a real watch, and consequently, features like leather straps with crocodile texture and stitching typical of luxury watches like in Image A are absent. In Image B, the clock is a simple drawn version without specific detailing of straps, indicating there are no realistic elements such as the described strap.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the watch case and dial finished in a silver metallic tone with a brushed texture?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a cartoonist clock illustration that lacks any realistic metallic finish or brushed texture. The artwork focuses on humor rather than actual material representation. In Image A, these characteristics are evident via the high-quality image of the watch with a silver metallic dial and case. The comic form inherently dismisses actual material textures present in a photographic representation.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a continuous minute track around the outer edge of the dial with markings from 5 to 60?",
    "explanation": "Image B lacks accurate time-telling details such as a minute track because its nature as a comic places emphasis on artistic style over functionality or realism. Such intricate characteristics are found in Image A, where they are part of the real watch design. Hence, based on the image style in Image B, the presence of a minute track as described is invalid.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the numbers 12, 2, 4, 8, and 10 displayed as Arabic numerals at their respective positions on the dial?",
    "explanation": "The clock in Image B illustrates a cartoonist approach with scribbled text and lacks actual functional numerals. In a comical approach, although resembling numeral positions, they do not reflect typical Arabic numeral representations. Image A showcases precise numeral positioning around a real watch face confirming the expected arrangement. Therefore, Image B does not contain Arabic numerals in these exact positions.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Are there two pushers and a crown located on the right side of the watch case?",
    "explanation": "Image B's depiction focuses on a comedic oversized clock which structurally omits sophisticated elements like pushers and crowns that are visible in Image A, which is an actual watch featuring such parts in detail. The cartoon lacks technical nuances evident in real chronographs such as the image A watch setup.",
    "answer": "No"
