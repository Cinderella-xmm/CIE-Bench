      "question": "Is the bird rendered in a vibrant yellow color matching the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is depicted with a shade of yellow that appears consistent with the style of illustration, which is simpler and more graphic than Image A. The original image in Image A shows a realistic bird with vibrant yellow coloring. However, due to the illustrative nature of Image B, it lacks the intricate detail and shading seen in Image A, although it might represent the same conceptual yellow. The reasoning considers the essence of color representation in artistic illustrations compared to realistic photos.",

      "question": "Are there distinct black stripes visible on the bird’s wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird’s wings have clear black stripes that are part of the illustrative design, simplifying the realistic texture into more defined graphic elements. In contrast, Image A has a more detailed depiction of black stripes along the wings, with fine lines that represent real feathers. Comparing both, Image B preserves the essence of the black stripes through a simplified illustration technique, which aligns with artistic representations.",

      "question": "Does the bird have a clearly defined round black eye?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird has a stylized, round black eye, which is a characteristic often seen in illustrations to depict a simple yet expressive feature. Image A portrays a realistic depiction, where the eye is a prominent and detailed round black feature. The comparison shows that both images maintain the concept of a round black eye, though Image B's is more stylized.",

      "question": "Are the cherry blossoms depicted with five rounded petals and a pale pink color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossoms are illustrated with five distinct rounded petals, and they display a pale pink color, consistent with common representations of cherry blossoms in illustrations. In Image A, the realistic blossoms also have five rounded petals and similar coloring. Both images maintain the characteristic appearance of cherry blossoms, even though one is realistic and the other is an illustration.",

      "question": "Are the bird’s feet orange-yellow in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird’s feet are not clearly defined as orange-yellow due to the graphic style, which limits the color details provided by the simpler design. Image A shows the bird’s feet as a realistic orange-yellow. The comparison indicates that Image B might have omitted or simplified the colors for stylistic purposes, thus not showing clear orange-yellow feet.",

      "question": "Are the bird’s feet positioned as if gripping a branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird’s feet are not distinctly detailed in a position that suggests they are gripping a branch, as the simplified style doesn't provide enough detail. In contrast, Image A shows the bird’s feet gripping the branch naturally. The lack of detail in the representation in Image B prevents an interpretation of the feet actively gripping a branch.",
