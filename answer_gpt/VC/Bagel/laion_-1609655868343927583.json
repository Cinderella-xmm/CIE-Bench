      "question": "Is the herringbone wood inlay pattern present on the surface of the transformed character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character features a decorative pattern on its outfit; however, the pattern consists of multiple jewel and gold accents rather than a herringbone wood inlay. The herringbone pattern on the original wooden cabinet, Image A, is a distinct zigzag pattern typically found in woodwork, which is not replicated in the transformed character. Therefore, the pattern has been replaced with a more ornate design.",

      "question": "Are the circular brass ring pulls and adjacent escutcheons present on the transformed character’s waist area, matching their original positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character has a belt with circular decorations that resemble the original brass ring pulls and escutcheons from Image A. The placement on the waist area of the character is similar in purpose; however, they do not match the exact original position as they were on the cabinet drawers.",

      "question": "Does the transformed character retain the original warm amber-brown wood color as the base tone of its body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character does not have the warm amber-brown wood color of the original cabinet in Image A. Instead, it features a colorful and intricate design with royal blue, gold, and red hues, indicating a loss of the original wood color as the base",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a character with claw-like feet, which do not resemble the original tapered wooden legs with brass caps in Image A. The small brass caps at the end of the cabinet legs are a distinct feature not carried over to the transformed character's new feet design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed character's legs have become claw-like feet and do not exhibit the original tapered, narrowing design of the cabinet legs seen in Image A. The design transformation eliminated tapered features.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not prominently feature elements resembling the vertically stacked drawers of Image A. The transformed character appears to have a continuous body without distinct stacked features as the original drawers present in the cabinet.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The decoration on the transformed character in Image B is more abstract and ornamental, lacking the distinct brass foliate motif found on the side of the cabinet in Image A. The transformation emphasizes jewels and extravagant garb, not retaining original side motifs.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, the character wears a crown that does not replicate the semi-circular edge shape of the marble top from Image A. The crown in Image B is distinctly round and adorned with jewels, diverging from the marble piece's geometric design.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformed character in Image B does not show distinguishable pouches or drawers with a visible interior. Thus, the suggestion of depth and openness from Image A's dark drawer interiors is absent.",
