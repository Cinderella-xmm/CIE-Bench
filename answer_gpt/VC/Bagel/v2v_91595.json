      "question": "Is the \"Nikon\" logo clearly visible on the top of the camera body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the camera features a prominent, stylized owl’s eye instead of the regular structure of a camera, thus the 'Nikon' logo is obscured and not visible. In Image A, the logo ‘Nikon’ is clearly displayed on the top ridge of the camera body. Comparing the two images, Image B does not maintain the original logo visibility due to the artistic alteration.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the \"Nikon D800\" text visible on the back label of the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a highly stylized mechanical configuration with gears visible rather than a traditional label with text, implying an artistic fantasy design rather than realistic labeling. Image A clearly displays 'Nikon D800' on the back label. This alteration leads to the absence of visible text in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the battery compartment door open and hinged on the left side of the camera body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images depict an open battery compartment but differ in design context. Image B exhibits a similar compartment door open to the left akin to Image A’s mechanical feature, yet contains intricate gear artwork rather than a standard camera interior.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the orange plastic tab visible inside the battery compartment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the battery compartment is transformed with gears rather than realistic inner components, and lacks the distinctive orange tab seen in Image A. Image A clearly shows the orange plastic tab as part of its genuine design.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the black EN-EL3e battery partially inserted into the battery compartment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, proximity of the battery to the compartment can be noted. The camera in Image B preserves the position of the battery consistent with Image A's design but subject to artistic embellishments surrounding it.",

      "question": "Does the camera body retain a matte black finish across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B embodies an elaborate, fantastical design featuring regions like an owl and metal gears, which alter the surface appearance; regions are polished and metallic rather than uniformly matte across the surface seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the textured rubber grip visible on the handgrip of the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, intense modification replaces typical camera elements with decorative ones such as the owl, eliminating the original textured rubber grip seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question": "Is the silver metallic ring of the lens mount visible and centered on the front of the camera body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Replacements in Image B feature an owl’s eye covering the camera's lens mount region, diverging extensively from the centered silver metallic ring present in Image A, obscuring the original camera layout.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B replaces label content with creative mechanical artwork, removing visibility of standard camera texts and numbers existing in Image A. Therefore, Image B does not showcase 'MADE IN JAPAN' or the specified serial number.",
