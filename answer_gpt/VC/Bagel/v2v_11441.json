        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the radish character maintains its form; it has a white oval body with a slightly pointed bottom. This is consistent with the depiction in Image A, which shows the same body shape, indicating that the fundamental design hasn't changed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the radish character with three green leafy sprouts extending from the top. By examining the visual cues of leaf count and comparing with Image A, which also exhibits three leaves, the images are consistent in this aspect.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The radish in Image B has two black circular eyes and a curved smile.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      ],

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog appears light brown but is now outfitted in winter clothing, possibly obscuring usual fur details. While the red collar remains visible, the darker brown details mentioned in the question are unclear due to the clothing. Image A shows the dog with noticeable fur colors, confirming the initial appearance.",
