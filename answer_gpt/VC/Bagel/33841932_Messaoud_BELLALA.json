      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the curved, tapering silhouette of the central golden skyscraper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the second bookmark from the left represents a skyscraper with a slender, tapering shape. It retains some aspects of the central skyscraper's silhouette from the original Image A where the golden skyscraper also has a curved and tapering top. The hallmark of the skyscraper, captured in the bookmark, is its narrowing towards the top, maintaining the tapering silhouette.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the sharp, asymmetrical top of the leftmost skyscraper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the first bookmark from the left depicts a building that is symmetrical and straight. In Image A, the skyscraper on the far left has a sharp, asymmetrical top with an angled design. The bookmark in Image B does not have this asymmetrical, sharp design and is distinctly more uniform and structured.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the stepped, rectangular form of the building next to the central tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the second bookmark from the left corresponds to a simplified representation of a skyscraper that features a set of steps near the top, resembling the tiered section in the original Image A, located to the left of the central tower.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the vertical light strip pattern on the right-side skyscraper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rightmost bookmark does not explicitly feature a pattern resembling vertical light strips. In Image A, the skyscrapers on the right side have visible vertical light strips due to the illuminated windows. The bookmark does not maintain this vertical pattern, opting instead for a flat design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the bookmark preserve the height-to-width ratio and tapering proportion of the central skyscraper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central skyscraper in Image A is characterized by its towering height and tapering form. The second bookmark in Image B features a similar thin, elongated shape, capturing this characteristic height-to-width ratio and taper, maintaining the visual proportions seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the wider base of the central skyscraper compared to its upper section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the second bookmark from the left has a consistent width along its length without an explicit widening at the base. In Image A, the central skyscraper has a visually more slender top compared to its base. This tapering aspect and base-to-top width ratio are not preserved in the bookmark.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the red buoy present in the final image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image A, there is a visible red buoy in the water area. However, in Image B, which is composed entirely of bookmark designs and lacks any water or sea features, there is no red buoy represented or visually identified in the design.",
