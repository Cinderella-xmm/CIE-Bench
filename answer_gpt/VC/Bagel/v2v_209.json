      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a stylized representation of a rocking chair, as one might find on an enamel pin.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the back of the portrayed chair consists of several vertical lines or spindles that are arranged between a top rail and a bottom rail.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration in Image B features curved armrests that are visibly connected to the chair's front legs. The connection between armrests and legs is depicted with simple joints or supports, albeit less detailed given the stylized nature of the image. However, it reflects the common rocking chair style where armrests often curve and follow a line to meet the front end, with some form of support included.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the stylized nature, the top of the upright posts at the back of the chair exhibit round shapes which seem to resemble spherical finials. These finials are typical decorative features that cap the top of posts in furniture design, providing an aesthetic finish.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The representation in Image B captures the essence and proportions typical to a rocking chair, with an illustrated tall back, curved seating surface, and a visually balanced leg and rocker structure. Even with simplified details, these proportions are maintained to ensure the depiction remains recognizable as a traditional rocking chair.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design depicts the rockers at the base as directly and visibly connected to the legs, creating a continuous and flowing curve typical of the base structure of a rocking chair. This feature is essential as it enables a rocking motion, and the artistic representation keeps this continuity intact.",
