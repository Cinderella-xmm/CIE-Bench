      "question": "Is the clock frame still circular in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock frame appears to be circular, which is consistent with the design of traditional clocks where the circular shape allows for uniform marking of time around a center pivot. Observing the frame of the clock in Image B, it maintains the circular form. This shape is a common choice for both aesthetic and functional reasons, providing symmetry and ease of time-telling. Thus, drawing on the design principles of clocks and the visuals in Image B, the frame is indeed still circular.",

      "question": "Do the proportions of the clock hands and line markers remain consistent with the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock hands and line markers appear similar in proportions to what would be expected in a traditional clock, where the minute and hour hands have a noticeable difference in length, and the markers are evenly spaced. This observation is consistent with Image A, where the proportions served the practical purpose of clearly indicating time. Based on these details, the design retains consistent proportions for functional and visual consistency with the original, ensuring that time is represented clearly.",

      "question": "Is the clock face still white with black line markers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a clock face that is white with black line markers. This color choice is typical for maximizing contrast and readability, a well-known design choice in timepieces. The contrast ensures the users can easily discern the time regardless of lighting conditions. Comparing with Image A, where the same theme seems present, Image B maintains the same design approach, effectively keeping the clock face white with black markers for optimal visibility.",

      "question": "Are there still no numerals on the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face is shown to have no numerals, following a minimalist style commonly used in modern clocks to provide a sleek appearance without compromising functionality. This style, seen in both digital and analog clocks, is popular for aesthetic reasons. Comparing to Image A, where the clock design also lacks numerals, it is determined that the choice to omit numbers remains unchanged, aligning with both practical and stylistic trends.",

      "question": "Are the clock hands and markers positioned relatively the same as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the clock hands and line markers seem to be positioned similarly to how they would be in standard clock designs, maintaining a uniform distribution for readability and balance. This arrangement is key for accurate time reading and familiar design symmetry. Comparing to Image A, which likely had accurately positioned hands and markers, Image B appears to reflect the same alignment, demonstrating consistency in their placement relative to each other and to typical timekeeping conventions.",
