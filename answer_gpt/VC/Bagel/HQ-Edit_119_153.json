      "question": "Are the pointed gables with spire-like finials at the roof peaks present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a miniature castle under a dome. The castle has several towers with pointed roofs, each topped with spire-like finials. This design is consistent with pointed gables and spire-like finials, often seen in fantasy-inspired architecture. Therefore, the presence of these architectural elements is confirmed in Image B.",

      "question": "Is there a central balcony with intricately carved wooden railing located below the uppermost gable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a castle, but there is no visible central balcony with intricate wooden railing as part of its design. The focus is on stone towers and blue roofs, without any prominent balcony structure like described.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there arched windows with decorative tracery visible on the front facade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature castle has small, elaborate windows, fitting the theme of decorative architecture. Though these windows are small and blend into the fanciful structure, they do not clearly feature tracery as one might expect in classic arched window designs. The focus is more on the fantasy castle aesthetics rather than traditional architectural tracery.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The roof of the miniature castle in Image B is indeed covered with blue, possibly sapphire-like material. This is consistent with the blue roofs typical in fantasy designs, often meant to give a magical or dream-like appearance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a castle with a smooth, stone-like finish as typical in miniature fantasy models. There is no visible natural wood texture on the exterior, suggesting a more polished and fantastical aesthetic rather than a natural wood finish.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entrance in Image B's castle is a significant feature, with a wooden-like door positioned centrally on the base level. It follows the aesthetic seen in many fantasy castles where the entrance is distinctive and central.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image Bâ€™s castle maintains a symmetrical appearance, especially as seen from the front. The central alignment of the doorway, windows, and towers suggests balance and symmetry around its central vertical axis, characteristic of castle designs which often highlight symmetry for visual impact.",
