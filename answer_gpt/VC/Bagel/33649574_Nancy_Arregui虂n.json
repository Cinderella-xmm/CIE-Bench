      "question": "Is the rooster’s comb present on top of its head in a prominent, upright position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, what appears to initially be a rooster is transformed into a colorful fantasy bird with long feathers arising from its head in various colors. These feathers are unlike the fleshy comb of a rooster. By combining visual information and common zoological knowledge, it’s clear these features symbolize something different than a rooster's comb, indicating that the comb is not present in its usual form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red fleshy wattles visible under the rooster’s beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area under the fantastical bird’s beak does not show the typical red fleshy wattles found on roosters. Instead, the beak and the area surrounding it are stylized, with no distinctive wattles. The lack of typical rooster features and presence of an artistically modified design make it clear that the wattles are not visible.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the rooster’s beak clearly visible and positioned at the front of the face, with a pointed tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beak of the fantastical bird resembles that of a bird, situated at the front and possessing a pointed tip, which aligns with the general description provided. Although styled in a fantasy manner, the position and shape match that of a beak.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the rooster have two legs with three forward-facing toes and one rear toe on each foot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird-like creature possesses two stylized legs with decorative elements making it challenging to count toes. However, inspection does show a formation aligning somewhat with the structure described. Though artistically modified, the creature maintains a leg structure reminiscent of a bird's anatomy.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fantastical bird is shown standing on a dark gray asphalt surface, akin to Image A. There are scattered leaves and small plant fragments visible, consistent with the texture and environmental context of the surface.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird-like creature stands upright with its head elevated. The position is consistent with standing upright behavior, although the fantasy art style may imply a different posture. The principle of its posture aligns with the description.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fantastical bird has a tail that is positioned at the rear. This tail, however, extends in grand curves and is covered in vibrant patterns, differing from a typical rooster’s plumage but maintaining a directional flow consistent with the description.",
