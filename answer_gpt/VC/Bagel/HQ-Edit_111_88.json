        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's posture is similar to what's described. Her right leg is raised, bent at the knee, and pointed downwards while her left arm is extended upward, depicting a typical dance movement. This is consistent with a forward-leaning dance position. My analysis draws upon the visible posture and typical dance poses where extremities are extended to convey motion.",
