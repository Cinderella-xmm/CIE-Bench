      "question": "Is the bird depicted with bright yellow feathers and an orange beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is visually depicted with bright yellow feathers, a vibrant yellow that covers its entire body, and an orange beak. This is evident from the clear distinction in color between the feathers and the beak. Combining world knowledge, birds with such colorful plumage are often associated with tropical or warm regions. The brightness and saturation of the colors strongly suggest the hues described.",

      "question": "Does the bird have black eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bird's eyes as being dark and distinct from the feathers and beak. Since the eyes are portrayed in a very dark, nearly black shade against the bright yellow feathers, and not showing any other color, common knowledge indicates these as black eyes. Birds often have dark eyes which provide a stark contrast to their colorful plumage.",

      "question": "Is the bird perched on a thin branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is resting on a slim branch, which can be discerned by the proportional size of the branch relative to the bird's body. The branch, being thin, supports the bird at a single point without appearing overly large or cumbersome in relation to the bird’s size. Commonly, such scenes depict small birds utilizing thin branches as perches, illustrating the dynamic balance and posture of avian species.",

      "question": "Does the background have a natural setting with green hues and a bokeh effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B shows a blend of green and other natural shades, along with a bokeh effect, which is characterized by out-of-focus light circles. This backdrop provides a soft, natural ambiance typical of photographs taken in natural environments or habitats. These techniques in photography often emphasize a natural setting, using green hues to suggest foliage or open-air scenes.",

      "question": "Are the bird's feet visibly gripping the branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird’s feet are depicted as clasping onto the branch they are perched on, indicating a secure hold. This is visible by the way the bird's feet are positioned around the branch, clearly gripping it from both sides. Such depictions are consistent with how birds naturally perch, using their feet to maintain balance and stability on branches.",
