    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the bag still rectangular in shape with rounded corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bag maintains a rectangular overall structure, similar to Image A, despite the differences in design elements. The corners appear slightly rounded, consistent with a standard bag design that emphasizes softness and ease of handling, which the shape indicates.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the bag retain a flap-over front section with a horizontal crease?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a highly stylized and abstract design, which does not visibly show a traditional flap-over section with a horizontal crease. Instead, it displays a series of geometric patterns across the surface, differing from a typical flap design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a zipper running across the top edge of the bag with a visible gold-tone pull tab?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a traditional zipper mechanism or a gold-tone pull tab. Instead, the bag features an artistic top design with intricate geometric patterns, which obscures or replaces the need for a visible zipper.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there two vertical stitched panels visible beneath the flap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design is dominated by irregular geometric patterns and lacks clear stitched panels beneath a flap, contrasting with Image A's visible stitching details. Due to this artistic abstraction, the stitched panels are not discernible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the bag have an adjustable shoulder strap with brass-colored buckles on both ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image suggests that the bag features a shoulder strap, as seen by the consistent presence of elements attached to the sides, but the exact adjustability feature with brass-colored buckles akin to traditional bags is obscured by the abstract design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the bag positioned horizontally and upright in the center of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bag placed centrally in the frame. It is displayed in an upright, horizontal position, consistent with conventional presentation for bags, to showcase both the design and structure.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
