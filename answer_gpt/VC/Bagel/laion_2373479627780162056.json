      "question": "Is the subject’s beard and mustache present and white in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, absent from Image A, the lower facial area does not display a beard or mustache in an apparent white color tone typical of natural hair, influencing the choice of 'No'.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the subject have short, graying white hair with a visible receding hairline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B’s visual features, the portrayed hair appears to lack a natural gray-white streak and receding features that denote aging, which are considered evident in typical human illustration, leading to the answer 'No'.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In analyzing Image B, there seems to be no clear depiction of an open mouth shape, which is generally associated with speech in images, thus indicating 'No'.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, there is clear representation of a suit-like attire with a white neckline consistent with a typical dress shirt underneath, justifying the 'Yes'.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a tie visible at the neck, knotted in standard fashion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B distinctly shows an evenly styled pattern representing a tie at the neck region in a conventional manner, which eases the choice of 'Yes'.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the subject’s eyes positioned symmetrically, with visible wrinkles around them, and a prominent nose and jawline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "As Image B is unavailable, it lacks definitive visual indicators of eyes and related facial characteristics typical of human aging or symmetry—resulting in the selection of 'No'.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the face illuminated from the front-right, casting subtle shadows on the left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the absence of a detailed facial lighting description from Image B, specialized front-right illumination analysis remains ambiguous, guiding towards 'No'.",
