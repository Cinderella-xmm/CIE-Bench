      "question": "Does the zebra retain its black-and-white stripe pattern without significant alteration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra retains a visually recognizable stripe pattern. Although the colors are altered to a more surreal palette with a stark contrast that affects the overall appearance, the distinctiveness of the stripes is preserved. The pattern conforms to the typical zebra stripes known in world knowledge, although the colors are unconventional.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the zebra still in its original standing posture facing slightly towards the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stance of the zebra appears unchanged. The zebra stands with its body facing partially to the right, a position that aligns with common animal behavior in such situations and corresponds visually to zebra postures. Without needing to reference Image A, one can conclude that the posture is the same as the original image given the lack of indicators for a significant pose change.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the second zebra partially visible behind the first one, preserving its placement in the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of Image B shows a second zebra that is partially visible and positioned behind the first zebra. This arrangement is typical in depictions of multiple animals in natural settings. Descriptions of animal social behavior also support such positioning. The visual cues suggest that the placement remains consistent between the original and the edited images.",

      "question": "Does the image still feature a grassy savannah background with some scattered vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the coloration has been altered to a more vibrant and varied hues, the grassy texture and appearance of scattered vegetation are still discernible. The savannah landscape background can still be recognized through its familiar shapes and forms, even with the extreme color changes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the zebras' relative sizes, proportions, and perspectives maintained as seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual observation of Image B indicates that there is no alteration in the relative sizes, proportions, or perspectives of the zebras. Despite the extreme color modification, the logical consistency in size and placement corresponding to world knowledge about perspective and scaling continues to be present.",
