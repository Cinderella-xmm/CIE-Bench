      "question": "Is the ornate bow featuring symmetrical scrollwork and multiple spherical finials present and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B independently, the bow of the key features elaborate scrollwork with spherical finials arranged symmetrically across its design. These are typically signifiers of ornate craftsmanship, often found in decorative keys. There is no noticeable alteration or absence of these features in Image B when compared with what might be expected in ornate designs, hence applying this logic, the bow's symmetrical scrollwork and finials remain unchanged.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the double-notched bit at the end of the key preserved in its original H-shaped configuration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visual cues from Image B indicate that the bit at the end of the key appears to have an H-shaped configuration, commonly observed in older style keys. Utilizing this detail alone, it seems Image B retains the original H shape of the bit without distortion or modification.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the textured bands along the shaft preserved in their original placement and form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we can observe textured bands along the shaft of the key, which are typical design elements for keys, intended to provide grip or decorative emphasis. Without referring to Image A, their original placement and form seem untouched and consistent with traditional designs. When comparisons are made, these bands match those in Image A in placement and form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the key rendered in the original aged golden brass tone with visible highlights and shadows indicating metallic texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the key with a lustrous golden brass tone, having highlights and shadows that suggest a metallic texture, characteristic of items made from such materials. Upon comparing it with Image A, the tone and texture are consistent in both images, indicating no change.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the spherical finials positioned symmetrically around the scrollwork in the bow as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analysis of Image B alone, we can see that the spherical finials within the bow are placed symmetrically about the scrollwork, which often suggests completion or full functionality in ornate designs. Comparing this layout to Image A confirms that there is no deviation, hence the symmetry is retained.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the key proportionally accurate, with the bow, shaft, and bit maintaining their original relative dimensions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the key's bow, shaft, and bit appear consistent with typical key designs, where the bow is often prominent and accentuated. Comparing these proportions to Image A shows no significant distortion or alteration in proportions, affirming that the key maintains its original relative dimensions.",
