    "Question": "Q1: Are there exactly three triangular sails attached to the dhow, arranged in a staggered vertical line?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dhow has two triangular sails attached, rather than three, as detailed. The visual style indicates a stylized representation but distinctly shows two vertical sails without a staggered arrangement. By comparing Image B with Image A, which clearly displays three sails, the correct choice becomes evident.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the dhow have a wooden hull with visible arched windows and decorative lattice railings along the upper deck?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a visually ornate hull with artistic motifs, including windows and patterns suggestive of woodwork, matching the stylized depiction. While the material details are influenced by illustrative elements distinct from Image A's realistic depiction, the artistic attributes fulfill the criteria.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the dhow oriented diagonally across the frame, with its bow pointing toward the upper right?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dhow is positioned with its bow pointing toward the upper left, not the upper right, which contrasts with Image A's diagonal orientation toward the upper right. The stylized art in Image B alters this direction.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there multiple small sailboats visible on the horizon in the background?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not feature multiple small sailboats on the horizon. The background primarily consists of artistic patterns and landscape design without distinct visible sailboats, unlike Image A's depiction of multiple sailboats.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the sun located low on the left side of the image, casting a bright golden reflection across the water surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible sun casting reflections on the water surface. Instead, an artistic representation dominates the scene with no indication of a sun presence as in Image A's sunset depiction.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a visible wake and reflection of the dhow beneath its hull on the water surface?",
    "explanation": "There is no water reflection or wake visible in Image B, as the focus is on artistic representation rather than realism, in contrast to Image A, which clearly shows the dhow's reflections in the water.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the dhow have a long, pointed bow extending forward from the hull?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dhow is illustrated with a long, pointed bow extending forward, which matches the stylistic portrayal within the design. This depiction aligns with the dhow's characteristics in Image A, maintaining the bow's recognizability.",
    "answer": "Yes"
