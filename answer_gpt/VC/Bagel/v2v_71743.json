      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine if the text 'NEW YORK Guitar Method' is clearly visible and legible, I observe that the text is placed prominently at the top of the cover in a distinct typeface that contrasts well with the background. This makes the text easy to read. The combination of capital letters and font style aids in clarity. Thus, the text 'NEW YORK Guitar Method' is both visible and clearly legible on the cover.",

        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "The author's name 'Bruce Arnold' is located under the text 'Guitar Method', in a smaller font size but still maintains a good contrast against the background, making it legible upon inspection. The legibility of the name 'Bruce Arnold' is ensured by the contrasting color chosen for the font against the background, therefore it is visible.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "When looking at the cover, the text 'Ensemble Book 2' is observable, situated at the bottom center of the cover on a distinguishable green bar that sets it apart from the rest of the cover elements. There is a clear legibility due to the white text against a green background, making this part of the cover identifiable.",

      "explanation": "The cover features a logo that includes the text 'MUSE EEK'. This is located to the right side of the cover and is visibly incorporated within the right border, serving as a publisher's mark or branding feature.

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "On the cover, the guitar is clearly positioned diagonally across the lower half of the cover, cutting across from left to right. This diagonal positioning contributes to the dynamic composition of the design and contrasts with the vertical and horizontal elements around it. The diagonal layout of the guitar is noticeable and contributes to the aesthetic of the cover.",
