    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the chisel with a long straight steel shaft and wooden handle still present in the same shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a variety of tools are mounted on the pegboard. By inspecting these tools, a chisel with a long straight steel shaft and wooden handle can indeed be identified in the same position as Image A, suggesting it retains both shape and position. This insight was gained by observing its physical characteristics such as the steel shaft and wooden handle, and comparing it to the tool arrangement in Image A. Based on this visual assessment, the chisel appears unchanged.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the gouge with a curved cutting edge and oval wooden handle still present in the same shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a variety of tools are observed on the pegboard, including a tool resembling a gouge with a curved cutting edge and oval wooden handle. Upon close inspection and comparison with Image A, it becomes apparent that the gouge exists in the same shape and position as originally seen. The curved cutting edge and wooden handle identifier are crucial for this determination, aligning with the tool's specific features seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the hammer retain its original shape, including the clawed end and black metal head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer is displayed prominently on the workstation surface. Examination identifies that it possesses the same clawed end and black metal head seen in Image A. By focusing on its identifiable metal head and clawed ending, one discerns no changes in its form. Thus, both image inspection and knowledge of hammer design confirm its unchanged shape.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the wood shavings still in their original spiral curled form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents several spirals of wood shavings on the workbench. Comparing this observation to Image A, these shavings hold consistent spiral curled shapes in both images. The visual curvature and arrangement of shavings affirm that their form is retained flawlessly across both images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the natural wood grain and worn texture of the workbench still visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inspecting Image B's workbench shows the same visible characteristics of natural wood grain and worn texture seen in Image A. Analyzing the surface's appearance, including grain pattern and usage wear, reveals consistent textures across both images - confirming its unchanged presence.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the perforated pegboard with evenly spaced holes still present in the same layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, reviewing the pegboard unveils a design pattern with evenly distributed holes. Comparing this layout with Image A, no changes in hole positioning or pegboard design are evident. The comparison reflects identical spatial arrangement, signifying consistent layout preservation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the hammer positioned diagonally across the workbench?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a hammer situated on the workbench that does not conform to a diagonal alignment. Instead, it aligns horizontally. Contrasting with Image A's diagonal hammer placement informs us of this positional shift. Observing angle orientation, especially through endpoint positioning, solidifies the change from diagonal to horizontal.",

      "question": "Is the small wooden box containing wood shavings still present on the right side of the bench?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B brings into view the right section of the bench, where examination does not reveal the presence of a small wooden box containing wood shavings from Image A. Comparing regional exploration between images exposes an absence, which reflects a change in this setup. Observational focus on spatial occupation and content verifies this discrepancy.",
