    "Question": "Q1: Is the angular, multi-tiered headdress with symmetrical side flaps present and unchanged in shape and position?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the structure above the blurred region features angular, multi-tiered elements with what appears to be symmetrical side flaps. Given the overall similar shape to what's visible in Image A, this suggests the presence of an angular headdress. The shape and position of these elements remain consistent, indicating no changes in the structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the eyes glowing amber in color and positioned symmetrically within the face?",
    "explanation": "Without the need for comparison to Image A, in Image B there are bright, neon blue elements present rather than a natural glowing amber color. Based on these observations, combined with knowledge of typical glowing features, there are no amber eyes visible.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the stepped stone pedestal base present with distinct horizontal layers forming a pyramidal shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the structure below the blurred region has been modified to have a more sleek, modern, and shiny look with illuminated accents instead of the stone texture observed in Image A. Thus, the typical stone layers forming a stepped pyramidal shape are no longer clearly visible in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the segmented mechanical joints visible along the neck, beneath a translucent casing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there's no clear indication of segmented mechanical joints beneath a translucent casing. The lighting effect and the structure design conceal such details if present, so visibility remains questionable.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the head oriented directly forward, facing the viewer without rotation or tilt?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the visible angles and lines suggest that the head structure is facing forward, as the symmetry of the neon elements implies a direct orientation towards the viewer. There is no visible rotation or tilt.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the face symmetrically structured with aligned nose, lips, and jawline?",
    "explanation": "Considering world knowledge, features like nose, lips, and jawline have been abstracted or concealed in Image B, making the assessment of symmetrical alignment impossible with current information.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the head positioned directly atop the stepped pedestal, supported by it without floating or being detached?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the structure appears to be directly attached to the base with frameworks supporting the head, giving no appearance of floating or detachment relative to the sharply defined and illuminated base. While the materials and aesthetics change, the physical reliance remains consistent.",
    "answer": "Yes"
