      "question": "Are there two separate, cushioned backrest sections positioned side by side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a whimsical cloud-like creature made up of clusters of spherical elements. The appearance does not indicate any furniture structure, backrest sections, or cushions as seen in conventional sofas. Based on this analysis of visual elements that do not align with common furniture design, there are no separate cushioned backrest sections present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there two armrests, one on each side of the sofa, aligned with the seat cushions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perceived elements consist of cloud-like formations with cartoonish eyes and a tree-like extension. There are no alignments or structures resembling armrests or seat cushions typically associated with sofas.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays no furniture characteristics or structural integrity that indicates the presence of legs typical of sofas. The cloud-like clusters lack any visible bases or supports suggesting furniture legs.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sofa symmetrically arranged along a vertical centerline, with identical features on the left and right sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a creative depiction of cloud formations with connected spheres and an anthropomorphic tree. The design does not conform to symmetrical arrangements typical of sofas and lacks uniform features on both sides. The arrangement is more abstract and whimsical rather than symmetrical.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Without the conventional design elements of sofas such as seat cushions and backrest cushions visible in Image B, the cloud-like structure does not form any seating surface. It displays curved shapes without functional seating characteristics.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, does not depict any wooden frame structures or fasteners like those found in conventional seating or furniture. The focus is on cloud formations without identifiable structural components such as joints or fasteners.",
