      "question": "Is the bite mark present on the right side of the pear-shaped animal, exposing white flesh with an irregular edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pear has a bite mark exposed on the front side, which is visible in the setup inside a glass cube. The bite mark reveals the white flesh of the pear with an irregular edge. Comparing with Image A, the bite mark is on the side and similar irregularity and texture of the exposed flesh are present. The logic involves recognizing the characteristic irregular edge and exposed flesh in both images.",

      "question": "Does the interior surface of the glass cube display a visible wood grain pattern with a warm brown color matching the original wooden backdrop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the interior surface of the glass cube is shown, but the focus is more on the contents inside the cube such as the pear and the LEGO figure. No visible wood grain pattern resembling the wooden backdrop of Image A is apparent inside the cube. Therefore, the answer is no because the wooden texture from Image A’s backdrop isn't displayed within the glass in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the pear-shaped animal retain the small brown speckles across its outer surface, mimicking the original pear’s skin texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pear-shaped object inside the glass cube retains the small brown speckles, which are characteristic of a pear’s texture. The speckled appearance is similar to the original pear seen in Image A, supporting the conclusion that the texture has been preserved.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the top of the pear-shaped object inside the glass cube, there is a brown stem extending upwards from the narrow end. This feature is a direct match to the stem present on the pear in Image A. Both exhibit a typical pear stem.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pear inside the glass cube displays the classic teardrop shape with a narrow neck and broad base, consistent with the shape of the original pear in Image A. This silhouette is a distinctive and recognizable feature of pears.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has lighting tones that are warm and exhibit golden-brown highlights, with soft shadows apparent on and around the glass cube and its contents. This is consistent with Image A, where similar warm lighting and soft shadows feature over the pear and smartphone setup. The continuity in the lighting tones between both images supports the response.",
