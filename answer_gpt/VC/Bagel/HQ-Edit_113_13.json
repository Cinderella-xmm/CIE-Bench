      "question": "Does the fox retain its characteristic orange fur on the back and sides, white fur on the chest and muzzle, and black fur on the lower legs?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fox is depicted as a cartoon character with a simplified design typical of animations. The colors are flat and less detailed than a realistic depiction, but the fox retains distinct color patterns: an orange body, white chest and muzzle, and black lower legs, which are common traits of a stylized fox representation.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoon fox in Image B has a bushy tail depicted with a lighter (potentially white) tip, common in cartoon representations. The tail is distinct and stylized to appear fluffy, following the artistic choice typical in animations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the environment is simplified and stylized as a cartoon does not show detailed foreground elements like daisies. The focus is on the cartoon fox and its companions, and the background is simplified to basic shapes and colors.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the stylized cartoon Image B, the ground is not depicted with detailed textures like moss. The focus is on the characters and the ground is simplified without detailed texture representation.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a cartoon illustration with a simple background that does not have realistic lighting effects such as a glowing light source or rays. Instead, the background has subdued tones and lacks the detailed interplay of light found in realistic images.",
