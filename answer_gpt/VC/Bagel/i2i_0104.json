      "question": "Does the image retain the orange tabby fur pattern with distinctive stripe markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible parts of the kitten, such as the ears and some parts of the body, still exhibit the distinct orange tabby fur pattern with stripe markings. This is consistent with the common visual characteristics of an orange tabby cat, which have prominent stripe patterns. Thus, based on this visible evidence and commonly known characteristics of such cats, the answer can be determined.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the kitten's eyes still green with a clear, open expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has the face of the kitten blurred, obscuring the eye area. Without visible evidence of the eyes, it is impossible to determine their color or expression. Hence, in the edited image, the eyes being green and their expression cannot be confirmed.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the kitten's pink nose and surrounding white whiskers present and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kitten's face, where the nose and whiskers are located, is blurred. Therefore, these specific features cannot be confirmed as present or unchanged in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible portions of the kitten show its paws stretched forward on what appears to be a flat surface. This position suggests the kitten is lying down, as typically observed in such postures. The consistent visual indication supports this conclusion.",

      "question": "Is the background still softly blurred, maintaining focus on the kitten?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B appears softly blurred based on the visible parts of the image, an indication of a shallow depth of field often used to keep focus on the foreground, in this case, the kitten. Therefore, this visual feature maintains the focus on the kitten, in line with standard photography techniques to highlight the subject.",
