      "question": "Is the car rendered in its original red color in all views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car is presented in a collage format showing different views of the car. Each view consistently displays the same red color, which is typical for a Mustang, indicating no variation in color across the different views presented. The logical deduction is based on the uniformity of the color across each segmented image, aligning with standard representations of such vehicle images. Thus, the consistent hue suggests the car maintains its original red color in all displayed views.",

      "question": "Does the front view retain the detailed grille design and Ford emblem in its original position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the front view of the car clearly shows a detailed grille design with the Ford emblem situated centrally, which is typical for Mustang vehicles. The positioning of branding on vehicles is usually consistent and distinctive, serving as an identification mark. Common automotive design dictates that such emblems are positioned prominently for recognition, reflecting the same detail level as expected from the original design.",

      "question": "Are the same style and configuration of LED daytime running lights visible in both the front and side views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LED daytime running lights in the front view are visible and show a specific configuration, which is a stylistic feature of vehicle design. However, in the side views, the configuration is not distinctly visible or as prominent as in the frontal view. Based on the absence of visible LED configuration in the side views, it indicates that the same style and configuration are not discernibly present in all views.",

      "question": "Do all views show the same specific design and detail of the carâ€™s alloy wheels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a comparison of the wheels across different views shows consistency in design. Vehicle designs usually feature a standardized wheel style across all angles shown to maintain uniformity and brand design integrity. Observing the wheel design in all views confirms that the alloy wheels retain the same specific design and detail, ensuring there is no variation in style.",

      "question": "Are the body shape and proportions of the Mustang accurately represented in all views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The different perspectives in Image B indicate that the body shape and proportions remain faithful across each view. Typical automotive promotional images ensure that vehicles are consistently represented in shape and proportion to provide an accurate depiction regardless of perspective. Analysis shows that each segment of the collage maintains the known proportions and body styling of a Mustang, suggesting an accurate representation.",
