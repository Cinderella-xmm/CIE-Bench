        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango is depicted with a vivid yellow color and is arranged in a cubed pattern. This arrangement is common for sliced mangoes, where the flesh is cut in a grid pattern while still attached to the peel. Whether referring to real or stylized renderings of mangoes, the visual cues such as the cubed appearance and yellow color align with common representations of cut mangoes. Image A also shows a mango in a yellow color with a cubed arrangement, matching common expectations for typical presentation. Thus, Image B retains these elements seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the green color and sliced appearance of the lime?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lime is depicted with a bright green color and a circular, segmented appearance, which is typical of a cross-section of a lime. This is consistent with how limes are typically presented when cut open. Image A shows a lime that is sliced in half, revealing the segments, and has a natural green color. Image B, although more stylized, retains these essential characteristics.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chili powder is displayed in a bright orange-red hue and maintains a texture that suggests granularity, typical for spices. This portrayal aligns with common expectations of chili powder, which usually appears as a coarse or fine blend of ground chili peppers. Image A also shows the chili powder with a similar orange-red color and granularity, although the texture in Image B appears more stylized.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of the objects (mango, lime, chili powder, and whole mango) shows the mango with the cubed pieces positioned centrally on the left, the lime in front, and the chili powder beside the lime, with the whole mango toward the background. This positioning mirrors what is seen in Image A, despite a more cartoonish rendering in Image B. The relative positions of these objects on the plate remain consistent between both images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plate is displayed with a smooth, uniform surface that lacks distinct wood grain or texture, giving it a more polished and stylized appearance compared to what could be expected of natural wood. Image A shows a plate with a visible wooden texture, characterized by a slightly rough surface and natural wood patterns. As a result, Image B does not retain the wooden texture seen in Image A, opting for a simpler representation.",
