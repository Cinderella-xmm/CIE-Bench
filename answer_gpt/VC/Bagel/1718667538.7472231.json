      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the tiger mask clearly defined with orange and black stripes arranged in a typical tiger pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger mask is prominently characterized by its distinct orange and black stripes in a pattern typical of a realistic representation of a tiger. The symmetrical grouping and bold colors are reminiscent of a tiger's natural markings. This consistent patterning aligns with common perceptions of a tiger's appearance.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are pink cherry blossoms with black branch outlines visible on the kimono?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts what appears to be a kimono with a floral design. While there are flower motifs, the image is an artistic paper craft, and doesn't distinctly show pink cherry blossoms with black branch outlines like in a detailed textile print. The blossoms do not show intricate branch details.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the tiger mask show an open mouth with visible fangs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger mask is illustrated in an artistic style, and the details of the mouth show some open characteristics with stylized fangs implied by the cut paper shapes, aligning with the mouth depicted in the paper cut-out design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a red obi with horizontal bands wrapped around the waist of the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stylized representation of a kimono and obi. The design includes horizontal elements, but the primary feature isn't distinctly a red obi with horizontal bands. The paper craft representation simplifies these elements.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the subject positioned directly facing the viewer in a seated posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a flat, stylized depiction typical of paper art and doesn't provide spatial representation such as posture or a seated position. The design shows the character head-on, but it lacks the depth needed to confirm a seated posture.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are pink cherry blossoms hanging from above in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design does not accommodate a dynamic background with cherry blossoms hanging as seen in traditional image backgrounds; instead, the flowers and elements are part of the flat, fixed artistic arrangement rather than hanging elements.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the kimono primarily cream-colored with pink floral patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono depicted in the paper craft version shows orange and black stripes with incorporated motifs, diverging from a primarily cream base with pink floral patterns. The colors are more vibrant and less pastelled.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there black trim lines along the edges of the kimono and obi?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's paper craft design incorporates bold colors and edges, making use of contrast, but does not clearly show black trim lines typical of an edged textile. Instead, the outlines are part of the paper's edge design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Do the tiger mask’s ears have an upright shape with orange inner surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does include the tiger mask with an upright ear shape and orange within, consistent with the depiction of a tiger in artistic forms, maintaining animal likeness through these distinct ear features.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q10",
      "question": "Is there white fur surrounding the tiger’s muzzle and cheeks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the paper craft interpretation suggests facial fur, but the simplistic and stylized nature of the design does not distinctly depict it as white fur outlining the facial area, focusing instead on color blocks and patterns.",

      "model_answer": "No",
