      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi keychain does not depict a pearl earring on the girl's left ear. The figure's ear is not adorned with any noticeable jewelry.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the chibi wearing a headscarf primarily in blue with no distinct yellow sections. The simple headscarf is consistent with the typical chibi style, which employs minimalistic and exaggerated features for effect.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the chibi figure wearing a yellow jacket over a gray shirt with no visible white collar. The garment style seen in the chibi is adapted to fit the cartoonish nature, simplifying the outfit to vibrant, easily distinguishable parts rather than nuanced details like a white collar.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figure's head is oriented directly towards the viewer, making direct eye contact, which is a common feature of chibi designs for engagement and expressiveness. Unlike side profiles or turned heads, this straightforward pose is typical for cartoonish artworks to emphasize the character's expression.",

The shiny material suggests its silver nature, and this setting is typical for easy attachment and durability.",
