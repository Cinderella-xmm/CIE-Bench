      "question": "Is the frisbee visible in mid-air between the two individuals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the frisbee is clearly depicted in mid-air between the two animated characters. It is a disc-like object, characteristic of a frisbee in a typical game of catch. This matches familiar portrayals of frisbee games.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does one individual have their arm extended forward, as if throwing the frisbee?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both characters have their arms visible, but neither displays a strong gesture that conveys the act of throwing a frisbee. Instead, both seem to be in a neutral position relative to the frisbee. Typically, a throwing action would show more dynamic arm extension towards the opposite individual, which is not present here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the other individual have both hands raised, prepared to catch the frisbee?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the individual on the left with their arms raised in front and hands open, a common stance for preparing to catch something flying towards them. This is consistent with the action of catching, especially in a frisbee game.",

      "question": "Are there trees visible in the background behind the characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is richly illustrated with multiple trees, characteristic of a lush, outdoor setting such as a park. The trees are an integral part of the scenic depiction common in anime style art.",

      "question": "Are both individuals wearing casual, non-sport-specific clothing (e.g., white shirts and jeans)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both characters are dressed in casual clothing suitable for daily activities, such as short-sleeved shirts and shorts, which can be considered non-sport-specific. The resemblance of their clothing to standard casual attire supports this assessment.",
