      "question": "Is the intricate engraved floral and scrollwork pattern on the teapot body still visible and intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot has a decorative label indicating 'Earl Grey Elegance' prominently on its body. This label partially covers the intricate engraved floral and scrollwork pattern, rendering it less visible. Comparing this with Image A, where the entire floral and scrollwork pattern was visible and intact, we can conclude that the pattern is not as prominent in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the teapot retain its rounded body, flared base, and domed lid with finial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot retains a rounded body, flared base, and a domed lid with a finial, similar to a traditional teapot design. This reflects a continuity with Image A, where these features were also present. The visual cues provided by the structure and shape in Image B confirm the retention of these characteristics.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the reflective silver-metallic surface of the teapot preserved, showing clear highlights and reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot appears to have a more matte finish with less pronounced reflections and highlights, unlike the reflective silver-metallic surface seen in Image A. The color is more of a dull gold or brass as opposed to a shiny silver, leading to a decrease in visible reflections.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spout and both handles appear to be positioned and shaped similarly to how they are in Image A, maintaining their curved forms. The overall design and orientation have been preserved between the two images for these specific components.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The decorative ridges and edge banding that were evident in Image A are still present in Image B, around the lid and the base of the teapot. These features add to the ornate design and are important elements that have been maintained in the edited version.",
