      "question": "Is the sink positioned directly below the mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sink is visibly placed directly underneath the mirror, demonstrating a clear alignment between the two. This placement appears to be central and typical of standard bathroom design, where mirrors are strategically placed above sinks for functionality and convenience.",

      "question": "Does the image include a mirror with a black frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror does not have a black frame. Instead, it is adorned with a pink neon light border as compared to Image A, which featured a black frame surrounding the mirror. This change in Image B is visually notable due to its bright and vibrant color.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the fixtures and cabinet as appearing to be a dark color, consistent with black, and the sink retains its white color, aligning with the color scheme seen in Image A as well. This consistency is maintained in Image B despite the change in lighting effects, allowing the identification of the predominant color scheme.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror maintains its rectangular shape, as does the sink and cabinet directly below it. The neon light border around the mirror highlights its rectangular shape by emphasizing its edges, and the overall geometry of the fixtures remains unchanged.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, above the sink, there is a black faucet clearly visible positioned beside the black soap dispenser. Their proximity is evident, and they both stand out due to their dark color against the background of neon lighting, confirming their side-by-side placement on the sink.",
