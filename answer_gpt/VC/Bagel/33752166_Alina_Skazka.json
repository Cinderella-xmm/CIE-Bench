      "question": "Is the V-shaped dual-wing silhouette of the building preserved in the edited version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building has been transformed into an object resembling a robot with stacked modular components. The original V-shaped dual-wing silhouette is not evident, as the robot has distinct rigid shapes and lines characteristic of mechanical structures. Image A clearly displays two angled wings that form a 'V' shape. Comparing both images, it is clear that the edited version does not preserve this particular architectural silhouette.",

      "question": "Are the floors stacked in a consistent, repeating modular pattern from bottom to top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object displays a repeating pattern of stacked modular components throughout its structure, resembling a robot comprised of identical blocks. This pattern is consistent from bottom to top, suggesting a uniform build. Image A shows varied floor designs with differing balcony arrangements, without strict repetition. Thus, in comparison, Image B indeed shows consistent, repeating modular stacking.",

      "question": "Are the windows and balconies aligned horizontally on each floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features illuminated components that resemble windows, and these components are aligned horizontally across each section, akin to a structured arrangement found in mechanical designs. In Image A, windows and balconies are shown with horizontal alignment typical of conventional building designs. Therefore, the comparison leads to the conclusion that yes, Image B shows horizontal alignment similar to a structured pattern.",

      "question": "Are the two wings of the building symmetrically positioned relative to the central vertical axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building is transformed into a robot-like figure with elements positioned symmetrically on either side of a central axis, indicating a balanced design. Image A shows a building where structural elements are offset, creating an asymmetrical appearance. Thus, comparing both images, the symmetry observed in Image B does not match Image A's asymmetric layout.",

      "question": "Are the yellow awnings present on the balconies in their original positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any features identifiable as yellow awnings originally present on balconies. Instead, it displays blocks with illuminated areas. Image A prominently features yellow awnings on its balconies. Comparing the images clearly demonstrates that the yellow awnings from Image A are not present in Image B's edited version.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a visible separation between the window openings and the projecting balcony overhangs on each floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a structure with components simulating windows and overhangs, but those elements do not show a clear separation typically found in architectural designs. Image A presents distinct divisions between windows and balconies, indicating conventional construction. Thus, when comparing both images, it is apparent that the separation present in Image A is not replicated in the edited version.",
