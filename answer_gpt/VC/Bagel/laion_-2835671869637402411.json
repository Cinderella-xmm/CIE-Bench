      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is seated on a wooden rocking chair instead of stone steps. The chair appears to be made of polished wood without any stone texture, cracks, or moss-like details typical of stone steps. In analyzing the original image, it featured stone steps with visible crack textures. Comparing both, Image B lacks any stone or step elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of a wooden furniture setting without any arched window or iron bars visible. The background is a simple dark color with wooden furniture elements. In contrast, Image A includes an arched window with vertical iron bars as part of the background. Therefore, Image B does not contain such a feature.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a plain background with a focus on a wooden furniture setting, having no walls, archways, or plants present. In Image A, the scene is characterized by dark, twisting vines and dried leaves covering the walls, enhancing a spooky atmosphere. Comparing the two, Image B lacks these natural or architectural features entirely.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B is seated on a wooden rocking chair in a minimalist environment devoid of any candy elements. Image A has candies scattered around a character, known from the Halloween theme setting. However, Image B presents a different context and visual setup, excluding such details.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is positioned on a rocking chair, with a Victorian-style outfit and her hands placed on the armrests of the chair. This differs from Image A, where the character is sitting on steps in a cross-legged position with her hands closer to her chest. This alteration means Image B doesn't reflect the same pose as the original image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays an intricate wooden furniture design, without the clear display of any sewing kits, porcelain figurines, or oil lamps. Image A has a basket on the character's left, and a glowing carved pumpkin, which might be akin to the oil lamp, on her right. In contrast, Image B doesn’t effectively depict these objects or their placements.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of an oil lamp. The image features a lighting setup that focuses on the doll-like character seated in the chair, without incorporating an oil lamp or a similar light source. Image A uses a pumpkin with a carved face glowing warmly, which is analogous to an oil lamp. However, Image B lacks this feature.",
