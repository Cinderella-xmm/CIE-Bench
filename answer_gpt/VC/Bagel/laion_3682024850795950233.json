      "question": "Does the edited image retain the grainy, porous texture of the whole wheat bread slices?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture of the bread does not mimic the realistic grainy and porous texture of whole wheat bread like in Image A. Instead, Image B depicts it with a more stylized and cartoonish style, which lacks the realism of whole wheat texture.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the green color and leafy shape of the lettuce leaves preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lettuce is shown behind the bread with a simplified, cartoonish depiction, using a bright green hue and exaggerated leafy shapes which resemble a playful artistic interpretation. This contrasts with Image A where the lettuce is more realistic.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the red tomato slice visible and intact in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible depiction of a tomato slice similar to the one in Image A. The edited image has a different artistic style that omits the tomato found in the original image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the text “AMERICA’S” displayed in brown serif font above the ribbon in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the portrayal involves a stylized version with visual text displayed in a simplified manner reading 'ANERICS' due to artistic choices and a different script style. This doesn't match the brown serif font 'AMERICA'S' from Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "question": "Is the maroon ribbon banner present across the center of the sandwich in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B feature a ribbon across the center of the sandwich, however, Image B uses a distinct visual approach with changes in color properties of the ribbon, reflecting an artistic adaptation rather than a direct copy.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the trademark symbol (™) present next to the word “SANDWICH” in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no clear depiction of a TM symbol accompanying the word 'SANDICH' due to the stylized alterations from Image A, where 'SANDWICH™' was properly annotated with a trademark symbol.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the text “SANDWICH™” displayed in brown serif font below the ribbon in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text that refers to 'SANDICH' is shown with a different style that strays from a clear serif font as in Image A, also lacking the 'TM' trademark symbol indicating a transformative simplification in the artistic rendering.",
