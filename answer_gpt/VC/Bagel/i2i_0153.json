      "question": "Is the truck still predominantly red in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck is clearly illustrated in a bold red color, which stands out against the other elements. Red is the primary color used for the truck's body, which aligns with the typical use of bright colors in illustrations for emphasis and visual appeal. This observation, combined with the understanding that Image B is a stylized representation, supports the conclusion.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B simplifies visual elements into more basic shapes and colors typical of illustrations or graphics. The area where the chrome exhaust would be is represented by a white simplified shape on the side of the truck, indicating the retention of the feature's presence, albeit in a stylized form.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels are depicted in their appropriate location and illustrated with black circles, indicating their placement on the truck. The lug nuts are represented by small black dots within the white circle of the wheels, matching their relative positioning as seen in most typical representations of vehicle wheels.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses thick, vertical blue lines to abstractly illustrate the slats typically found on a truck's grille. The center emblem is suggested by a red shape at the top center of the grille area. Thus, the edited image maintains these recognizable features in a simplified, stylized manner.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image uses light blue and white shapes to represent the windows on the cab, suggesting their intended placement and size on the truck. Additionally, a white rectangle on the side suggests the presence of the side mirror, maintaining its position and visibility.",
