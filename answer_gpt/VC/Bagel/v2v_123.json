      "question": "Is the glowing blue orb still present and held in the hands of the central character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central character is depicted holding a blue orb, which suggests it is consistent with the glowing blue orb from Image A. This visual consistency indicates that the orb remains present in the edited image, even though the style has shifted to a chibi representation.",

      "question": "Does the archer wear a floral crown made of pink and red flowers on her head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character identified as the archer is wearing a headpiece that includes red and pink elements, resembling a floral crown. This suggests that the floral crown present in Image A is carried over to Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a woven basket located near the feet of the character with blonde hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visual sign of a woven basket near the feet of the character with blonde hair. This is different from Image A, where such a basket is clearly visible. The change in style and representation in Image B may have led to its omission.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The palm trees in Image B retain the general silhouette and structure common to palm trees, although simplified for a chibi-style illustration. Thus, the essence of the palm trees' structure from Image A is retained in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water surface does not show detailed reflections of the palm trees and sky as it does in Image A. The style of Image B simplifies the overall scene, omitting these reflections.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the lighting consistent with golden-hour warmth, casting soft shadows and warm highlights across the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not replicate the golden-hour lighting present in Image A. The chibi style of Image B highlights a bright, uniform lighting lacking the warm golden-hour hue and dynamic shadows seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The relative positioning of the characters in Image B remains consistent with Image A. The character holding the orb is central, flanked by two others on either side, maintaining a similar spatial arrangement.",
