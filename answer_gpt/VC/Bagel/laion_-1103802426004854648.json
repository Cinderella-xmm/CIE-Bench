      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the seahorse’s body shaped with a curved neck leading to a downward-curving tail, forming a recognizable seahorse silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seahorse is depicted with a distinctive silhouette: a curved neck that extends into a downward-curving tail, matching the common shape associated with seahorses. The body is bent and the tail curls upward, forming a recognizable seahorse outline, which is typical in artistic representations of this aquatic animal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a music note symbol located within a heart shape on the central yellow belly section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the music note symbol is clearly integrated into the design of the seahorse; however, there is no heart shape surrounding it. The music note is prominently displayed on the body instead of being enclosed by a heart shape. Thus, the described feature does not match the visual presentation.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a ribbon-like bow positioned at the top of the seahorse’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the seahorse's head lacks a ribbon-like bow or any similar adornment positioned at the top. It has a fin-like crest that is typical of seahorse designs, but this crest is not a ribbon. Thus, there's no indication of the specified feature.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there exactly two fins positioned on the sides of the seahorse’s body, near the midsection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design of the seahorse includes multiple segments that resemble body armor, but it does not feature specific fins located on the sides. The poetic design relies more on the overall contour rather than realistic anatomical features like exact fins near the midsection.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the eyes large, round, black with white highlights, and placed symmetrically on the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the seahorse with eyes that are round and black. They are fairly large in proportion with the overall artistic design and placed in a balanced fashion on the face. This meets the description of large round eyes with some highlights typically used for illustrative emphasis.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the yellow belly section located centrally on the body and larger than the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seahorse appears to utilize its central body area for its artistic design, with a focus on color and symbol rather than distinct sections or proportions like a differently colored belly. As such, there isn't a clear depiction of a yellow belly section that is larger than the head, which means the visual information contradicts the question's description.",
