      "question": "Is the wide-brimmed cowboy hat still present on the head of the individual on the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show the individual on the left wearing a wide-brimmed cowboy hat. This matches the typical appearance of cowboy or western-style hats, characterized by their wide brims suitable for sun protection or stylistic elements. The presence of this hat is consistent in both the actual and edited images despite the artistic illustration in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the individual on the left have long wavy blonde hair and a full beard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration depicts the individual on the left with long wavy blonde hair and a full beard. This is determined by the visible features and styling incorporated into the artistic representation, which reflects typical characteristics associated with certain musical or cultural imagery.",

      "question": "Does the individual on the right have short brown hair and a trimmed beard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an artistic depiction where the individual on the right has characteristics typical of short brown hair. However, due to the nature of the illustration, specific details such as the presence of a trimmed beard are less discernible. Given the stylized depiction, we cannot conclusively identify a trimmed beard, suggesting the absence of this specific detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the two individuals standing side-by-side, with the left individual slightly forward and both facing the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artistic representation shows three individuals standing side-by-side, rather than two. The layout is uniform and does not imply the left individual is slightly forward. The characters appear to face forward, aligning with typical illustrative conventions where subjects are oriented towards the viewer.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration in Image B does not depict any individuals with open palms or specific gestures. The artistic style focuses more on their attire and overall appearance, rather than specific hand gestures, which are absent in this depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text present in Image B differs from Image A. Image B includes text that is part of the artistic background and design, resembling 'FLORIDA GEOGRALINE', but does not have the phrase \"RISE TO THE TOP.\" The artistic rendition alters the text style, emphasizing thematic visual rather than exact replication of Image Aâ€™s text.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration depicts individuals standing in a way that suggests they are facing forward, which is typical in such artistic representations to better showcase their features. However, the orientation is less precise compared to actual photographic imagery, due to the illustrative style.",
