    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the orange vertical support beams still present along the edges of the hotel building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building has maintained a similar structure. The vertical beams are mostly covered by vegetation, implying the absence of visible orange beams along the edges. Based on common architecture, if orange beams were present, they would interfere with the growth pattern of the vegetation, indicating they might have been edited out.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the lower part of the hotel building still painted in light blue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower part of the building still appears to have a similar tone to Image A. The color is likely to remain light blue, as indicated by the consistent hue seen in both images. This analysis is further supported by the predominantly blue color in both images, showing continuity.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the white columns supporting the ground floor of the hotel still visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B continues to display a structural element resembling columns under the building's periphery. These features align with architectural norms observed in Image A, suggesting continuity in the column design. Therefore, they are considered visible.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the swimming pool still kidney-shaped in outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pool in Image B, while slightly altered visually, maintains a distinct irregular shape reminiscent of a kidney. Based on pool shape analysis, pools resembling this shape appear relatively unchanged in their primary form.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the blue sun loungers still arranged around the perimeter of the pool?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows some vibrant colors and objects around the pool area, suggesting loungers may be present. However, these objects are not distinctly recognizable as blue loungers, indicating a significant edit of visual objects in this area.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the green-and-white striped umbrellas still visible near the poolside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while having reconstructed environmental features akin to Image A, it displays a lack of clear evidence of umbrellas resembling the ones seen near the pool in Image A. The visual elements in Image B do not distinctly indicate their presence.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there still people visible sunbathing on loungers or swimming in the pool?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks clear depiction of any human figures lounging or swimming, as figures appear to be toy-like or symbolic without human traits. Therefore, it does not display people visibly sunbathing or swimming.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the swimming pool still positioned directly in front of the hotel building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the positioning of the pool relative to the building remains similar. The pool remains in front of the hotel building in both images, aligned with typical hotel architecture.",
