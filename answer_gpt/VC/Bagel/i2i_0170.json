      "question": "Are there two women standing with their backs visible toward the shop window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two figures, presumably women, whose backs are visible. Their orientation suggests they are looking toward something, possibly a shop window given the context of the illustration. This conclusion is drawn from the positioning and the pose that typically represents looking at a display.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do both women stand upright with their attention directed towards the shop window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration in Image B portrays the two women in upright standing postures. The angle of their heads and the positioning of their bodies indicate they are focused on an object in front of them, likely a shop window, as suggested by the narrative of the image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the shop window displaying mannequins with outfits and handbags?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is stylized and abstract, showing silhouettes that suggest a retail setting. However, there are no explicit details indicating mannequins or displayed outfits. The visual cue of handbags with the figures might imply a fashion context but does not explicitly show a shop window with mannequins.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the two women dressed distinctlyâ€”one in a navy outfit with a beige bag, and the other in a beige sweater with a brown bag?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual representation is stylized. While one woman wears a navy-like outfit and is carrying a bag that could be interpreted as beige, the other figure's outfit contrasts with the first, apparent in a different color representing a distinct style, which fulfills the condition of distinct dressing. However, due to the artistic depiction, nuances in clothing are generalized.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two women are positioned near each other with similar postures, facing the same direction, indicating that they share a common focus, likely a shop window, following an inferred narrative from their directionality. This visual suggests proximity and shared intent.",
