      "question": "Is the car still primarily golden in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car is clearly visible with a golden color. It reflects light with a metallic shine that is typical of a golden object, indicating that the color of the car remains primarily golden. This conclusion is based on the visual observation of the car's exterior color, which retains its golden hue.",

      "question": "Does the car retain its basic shape as a four-wheeled vehicle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car is visibly identifiable as a standard four-wheeled vehicle. It has two wheels visible on each side, with a clear vehicle structure, including doors, windows, and the overall design typical of a car. The fundamental structure as a four-wheeled vehicle is unchanged.",

      "question": "Does the toothbrush still have an orange handle and white bristles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no evidence or visual cue of a toothbrush present in the image. The focus is solely on the car and the wooden frame. Therefore, the properties of the toothbrush, such as its orange handle and white bristles, cannot be assessed since it is absent from the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, only the car is visibly present, held within a wooden frame. The toothbrush is not visible or positioned anywhere within the image, making it impossible for them to be positioned opposite each other.",

      "question": "Is the background still a solid pink color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a solid pink color, similar to Image A. This solid color provides a uniform backing that contrasts with the objects captured in the image, indicating consistent background coloration.",
