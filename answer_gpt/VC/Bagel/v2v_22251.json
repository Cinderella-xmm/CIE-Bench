      "question": "Is the subject's face, including their facial features, unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we cannot see the subject's face clearly because it is blurred out. Therefore, it is impossible to determine if the facial features remain unchanged. However, since Image A has a blurred face as well, a comparison cannot be made.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the subject still have long black hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hair is no longer black and changes to long brown with curls. From the visual cues and texture of the hair, it is clear that the hair resembles a Renaissance style rather than the simple long black hair in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the green earrings still present on the subject's ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the earrings are not visible due to being obscured by the hair and changes in the outfit style. Since the Renaissance dress does not accommodate this earring style easily seen in Image A, it is logical to conclude that they are not present.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the subject still facing forward with a neutral expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the face is blurred and expressions cannot be determined directly, the body's posture facing forward remains consistent, indicating that the orientation is unchanged.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the contemporary graphic T-shirt design has been replaced with a Renaissance-era gown, which has ornate embroidery but does not have a graphic design similar to the one in Image A.",
