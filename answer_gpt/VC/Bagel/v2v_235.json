        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure has short, dark hair. This conclusion is drawn from observing the chibi-style character, which typically uses simplified and exaggerated features that often include distinct hair outlines. The hair is clearly visible as being short and uniformly dark.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character's right leg is seen extended outward in a high kick fashion, while the left leg is firmly placed, indicating that it supports the body's weight. This observation aligns with a common dance pose.",

      ],
