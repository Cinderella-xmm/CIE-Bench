      "question": "Does the cat retain its tabby pattern on its face and body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat exhibits distinctive dark stripes on a lighter brown background, which are characteristic features of a tabby pattern. These markings are present on the cat's face and extend over its body. This is consistent with the genetic traits known to define tabby cats. The visual cues in the image support the conclusion that these markings are indeed a tabby pattern.",

      "question": "Are the cat's eyes still vivid green?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the cat with strikingly vivid green eyes. The green color is bright and dominates the eye area, which is a common and distinct characteristic in some cat breeds. The clarity and intensity of the green are visually evident in the image.",

      "question": "Is the cat's belly and chest area still white?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's belly and chest region appear to be predominantly white. This area is visibly lighter compared to the rest of the cat's body, which aligns with common coloration patterns found in many cats where the underside is lighter. The visual information supports that these areas are indeed white.",

      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cat lying on what appears to be a wooden surface with a relaxed posture. The cat's front legs are extended, and its body language suggests a comfortable resting state. This posture is typical for a cat that is at ease, and the backdrop matches the appearance of a wooden floor.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fur texture of the cat is detailed, with individual strands and variations in the color visibly depicted. The lighting effects highlight portions of the fur and the wooden surface, creating shadows and highlights that add dimensionality. These visual elements suggest that both the fur texture and the lighting have been well-preserved.",
