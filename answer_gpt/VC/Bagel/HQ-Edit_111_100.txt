    "Question": "Q1: Is the fan-shaped headdress with radiating elements present on the warrior’s head?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object in focus appears to be a LEGO-like figurine. The headpiece of this figurine does not have any fan-shaped elements or radiating structures reminiscent of a headdress. LEGO characters usually have simple headgear due to the nature of interlocking bricks, and this figurine has what appears to be straightforward hair pieces instead of a headdress. Therefore, based on the visual observation of Image B combined with common knowledge about LEGO design, the fan-shaped headdress is not present.",
