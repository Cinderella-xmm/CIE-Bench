    "Question": "Q1: Are the dark wooden beams forming geometric patterns on the facades of the buildings clearly visible and structurally accurate?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dark wooden beams are depicted distinctly and form recognizable geometric patterns typical of timber-framed structures. The patterning of beams is clear and follows traditional European architectural styles, often used in miniatures or model representations. This indicates that the beams are structurally accurate for a miniature or model setting within a globe.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the buildings feature steeply pitched gabled roofs with dormer windows positioned at regular intervals?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings have steeply pitched gabled roofs, which is characteristic of many European architectural styles. However, due to the miniature model representation within a snow globe, the dormer windows may not be positioned with the same regularity typical of real buildings, as exemplified in architectural models. Thus, the dormer window layout isn't necessarily regular but fits the style represented.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Is there a pedestrian bridge spanning the canal in the mid-ground, connecting the two sides of the street?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a small bridge crossing the water channel in the model setting. This bridge serves as a connecting walkway, indicative of pedestrian bridges seen in quaint village displays. The depiction within the globe is artistic rather than precisely realistic, but it visually represents a bridge connecting the streets.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Does the canal surface reflect the surrounding buildings and sky with clear, mirror-like fidelity?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the canal is a model waterway within a globular ornament, so the water surface primarily provides a visual semblance of how it would reflect in a real scene. Given the artistic depiction in a snow globe, the reflection is not clear or mirror-like but serves more as a conceptual representation to add to the aesthetic, rather than mimic reality.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there flower boxes containing green plants visible along the balcony of the large building on the right side?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, modeled plants do appear on the balconies of the miniature buildings within the snow globe. These are represented as small, raised colored details that resemble flower boxes with greenery, designed to mimic the appearance of real flower boxes in a stylized manner.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are stone bases and metal railings present along the canal edges beneath the buildings?",
    "explanation": "The miniature model in Image B is enclosed within a glass globe, and it does not have real stone bases or metal railings in the same sense as real structures might. The representation of canal edges in the model is more simplistic due to its small scale, with suggestions of barriers, but not explicitly stone or metal as in realistic settings.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the windows arranged in vertical and horizontal lines on the facades, matching the timber frame divisions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the windows align with the timber frame divisions typical of traditional timber-framed architecture. The model in the snow globe captures this alignment well, presenting windows that fit within the framing to follow the traditional structural appearance, similar to real-world applications.",
    "answer": "Yes"
