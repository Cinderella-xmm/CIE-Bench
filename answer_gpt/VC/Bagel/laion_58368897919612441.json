      "question": "Are both corner towers with domed roofs and weather vanes present and positioned at the upper corners of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure is a miniature model of a castle enclosed under a glass dome. It features two corner towers that resemble typical castle designs, but they do not have domed roofs or visible weather vanes. The miniature knights surrounding the structure suggest a stylized representation rather than exact architectural details like domed roofs or weather vanes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the crenellated parapet running along the top edge of the tower intact and continuous?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a castle model under a glass dome. It has a crenellated parapet running continuously along the top edge of the tower, consistent with common medieval castle architecture. Given these visual cues, the parapet is indeed intact and continuous in this model.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the arched windows arranged symmetrically across the façade, including the triplet groupings above the main level?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the castle has symmetrically arranged features typical of medieval architecture, including windows with arches. However, the details of triplet groupings above a main level cannot be confidently discerned from the miniature representation within the dome structure. Given the stylized nature of this model, specific symmetry in window arrangements may be implied but not explicit.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a central arched entrance at ground level, directly beneath the central section of the façade, with a wooden drawbridge structure extending forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the castle model has a central arched entrance at ground level, consistent with typical castle designs. However, the entrance does not have a visible wooden drawbridge extending forward, as seen typically in larger castle designs. This is due to the miniature nature of the model enclosed under the glass dome.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there horizontal bands of alternating light and dark stone visible across the exterior walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a model of a stone castle, but the representation does not include visible horizontal bands of alternating light and dark stone on the exterior walls. The model focuses on the architectural shape rather than stone coloration patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the tower maintain a tall, rectangular mass with two prominent corner towers projecting outward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the castle model under the glass dome does maintain a tall and rectangular mass. It features two corner towers that project outward, adhering to the common structural design seen in many real medieval castles.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the wooden drawbridge constructed with a crisscross lattice pattern of beams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no wooden drawbridge observable in the model. The entry features instead reflect a simple path surrounded by miniature knights, thus eliminating any idea of a drawbridge or its lattice pattern.",
