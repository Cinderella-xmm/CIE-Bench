      "question": "Are there four clock faces, one on each visible side of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, we can see only two sides of the tower with clock faces visible, each with a clock. Given the perspective, if there were more than two, at least a part of another clock face would be visible. However, only two are distinctly shown, suggesting there are not four on each visible side. Thus, the answer is based on the observed visible faces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the clock faces contain black Roman numerals arranged in a circular pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock faces clearly display a circular pattern with black marks that are consistent with the appearance of Roman numerals. World knowledge about traditional clock designs supports this observation, indicating these markings are likely Roman numerals.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a steeply pitched pyramidal roof topped with a finial at the very top of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the top of the tower features a sharply pitched roof with a small structure rising from its peak, which is a finial. This matches the description of a steeply pitched pyramidal roof with a finial, consistent with architectural styles for such structures.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there four arched openings at the base of the tower, one on each side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, it appears there are visible arches on three sides, suggesting there is one on each side. Given typical symmetrical design in architecture, it's logical to infer there is another arched opening on the unseen side, completing four archesâ€”one per side.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the tower located at the center of a circular road with vehicles traveling around it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a roundabout layout with a tower positioned centrally and vehicles visible traveling in a circular formation around it. This setting establishes the tower as situated in the middle of a circular road.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there multiple cars visible on the road surrounding the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, depicts several vehicles distributed along the circular road surrounding the tower. This observation supports the presence of multiple cars traveling around the structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there trees with bare or sparse foliage visible along the road behind the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features stylized representations of trees, but they are depicted with vibrant yellow crowns, suggesting a creative alteration rather than bare or sparse foliage. If these trees were bare, they would likely appear with exposed branches, which is not the case.",
