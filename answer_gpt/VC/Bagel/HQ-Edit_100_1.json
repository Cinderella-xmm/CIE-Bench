      "question": "Does the edited image retain the tree's central position with a wide, spreading canopy and visible branching structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a crafted, three-dimensional art piece with a tree that has a central position within the frame, similar in placement to Image A. The tree in Image B also features a wide, spreading canopy with visible branches, albeit stylized in a more sculptural form compared to the natural look of Image A. Based on the context and visual presentation of Image B, the tree retains its central positioning and a canopy that spreads across the art piece, maintaining its structural visibility.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the leaves of the tree still displaying a visible gradient from green to orange and red?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree's leaves are uniformly green and do not show a gradient of colors like green to orange and red as seen in Image A. The crafted depiction in Image B lacks the naturalistic detail of varying leaf colors present in the original. Therefore, the distinctive color transition observed in Image A is not present in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the meadow clearly divided into a pink/red floral area on the left and a green daisy-filled area on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a meadow with a mix of colorful flowers, but it does not distinctly divide the meadow into separate color areas as does Image A. The flowers in Image B are mostly distributed evenly throughout the space without a clear left versus right color division. The consistency of flower placement and limited space in Image B exhibits a more blended floral representation compared to the division seen in Image A.",

    {

      "question": "Are white daisies still present in the green section of the meadow on the right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes white flowers among various other colors in the field but doesn't show a clear division between a green section and other sections. The flowers are evenly placed throughout and mixed in color, so the specific arrangement and context of white daisies defined in Image A's right side aren't distinctly represented.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a visible glow or backlight effect shining through the tree’s leaves from behind?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tree in Image B is portrayed as a three-dimensional craft with no natural light effects present, particularly the glow or backlighting that would occur naturally as seen in Image A. The lighting in Image B is more uniform, fitting a crafted design rather than a real landscape scene, thereby lacking any backlight effect.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the tree's base visibly rooted in the ground of the meadow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree's base appears to be firmly attached to the surface of the diorama-like artwork. However, the traditional notion of being 'rooted' in the ground as observed in Image A is less evident due to the crafted nature of Image B—where the tree is placed rather than planted in a natural ground setting.",
