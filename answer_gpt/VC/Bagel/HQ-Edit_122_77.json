      "question": "Are the pink peony flowers with yellow centers still present in the hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B shows floral arrangements in the subject's hair with light pink flowers that resemble peonies. The visual cues, such as the color and form of the flowers, suggest they are peonies, which often have striking centers. Hence, it's logical to conclude they still include yellow centers.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the subject wearing a garment with a similar texture, but the color visible appears to be a different shade, not the dark green seen in Image A. The high collar is no longer visible based on the new attire's style and color.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting remains soft and even, creating a balanced illumination across the visible features. World knowledge suggests this type of lighting is intended for a harmonious and aesthetically pleasing effect, especially in portrait photography.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject's eyes are not visible due to the blurred area in Image B, preventing an assessment of their color. Without visible eyes, the question cannot be answered affirmatively based on the visual information provided.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurred area in Image B indicates that the subject's face is positioned in the center of the image. Despite the blurring, the pose remains frontal as suggested by the symmetric alignment and composition.",
