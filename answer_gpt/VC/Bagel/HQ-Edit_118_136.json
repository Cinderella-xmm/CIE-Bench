      "question": "Is the skater depicted in a mid-air crouched posture with both arms extended outward for balance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater is seen crouched in mid-air with the arms bent and positioned to help maintain balance while engaged in the act of skating. This posture is characteristic of someone trying to maintain balance during a trick or jump. Combining this visual information with general knowledge of skateboarding, it is common for skaters to extend their arms outward for better balance while airborne.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the skater’s left foot placed firmly on the skateboard while the right foot is slightly raised off the board?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the skater's left foot appears to be firmly on the skateboard, as it is positioned to maintain control. However, the right foot is not distinctly portrayed as raised off the board. Instead, both feet are depicted in a way that similarly contacts or hovers above the board, contributing to the sense of movement. The overlap of the feet with the board visually indicates that both feet are in contact or very near the board to maintain control.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the skater’s head and eyes look toward the right side of the frame, indicating forward momentum?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater is shown in a mid-air position on a hoverboard-like device, set in a futuristic urban environment. The skater’s posture and position on the hoverboard, along with the neon lights and forward-leaning movement, suggest forward momentum. Though the skater's face is blurred, the direction of the body and where it's facing implies looking toward the right side of the frame—a typical indication of the skater's direction and momentum.",

      "question": "Is the skater positioned above the surface of the ramp, indicating he is airborne?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the skater in a futuristic setting, hovering on a futuristic board with neon lights. Despite the absence of a visible ramp in this image, the skater is clearly depicted floating above the ground. The visual representation of the skater above a surface and without contact indicates that the skater is airborne.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a second person, an older man in a dark jacket, visible in the background running across the ramp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on a singular skater in a futuristic setting. There is no presence of a second person or an older man in a dark jacket in the background. The image background consists of urban elements such as neon-lit structures but no other human figures.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a curved ramp structure forming a bowl-like shape in the foreground, beneath the skater?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the skater on a hoverboard-like object in a vibrant, futuristic setting. There is no visible curved ramp or bowl-like skatepark structure as could be expected in a more traditional skateboarding scenario. Instead, neon lights and a futuristic urban backdrop form the environment.",
