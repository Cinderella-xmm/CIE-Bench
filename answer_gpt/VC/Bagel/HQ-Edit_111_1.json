      "question": "Is the subject’s hair styled in a tight bun at the back of her head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hair is clearly styled into a tight bun, which is a common hairstyle for athletes as it keeps the hair out of the face and is easy to maintain. There are no stray hairs indicating a loose style, reinforcing that it is styled in a tight bun.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is wearing a sleeveless beige crop top. This can be observed from the visible armholes and the length of the top relative to the waist, along with the exposed abdominal area. The style of clothing is typical for athletic wear, providing mobility and comfort.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the subject’s shorts high-waisted with a visible elastic waistband?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shorts have a high-waisted appearance with a prominent elastic waistband holding them in place above the hips. This style is often used in athletic wear for better support and flexibility during physical activities.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the subject in a defensive boxing stance with both hands raised near her face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's arms and gloves are positioned more outward and away from the face, suggesting a non-defensive posture. This implies that the stance is not focused on defense, as a typical defensive boxing stance would involve the gloves being close to the face for protection.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no indication of a red rope in the foreground. This suggests there are no visual cues to confirm the presence of a boxing ring edge in the composition of this edited image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject clearly has boxing gloves on both hands, and the gloves include wrist straps visible around the wrists, demonstrating a typical design for securing gloves during the activity of boxing.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While assessing the expression cannot be done in Image B, assessing other aspects would lead to no conclusion. Without visual cues from the face, we can't say the subject has a focused or intense expression.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's midriff is clearly exposed, and the presence of defined abdominal muscles is emphasized. This is a common illustration style to represent strength and fitness in athletic depictions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Does the subject have a natural skin tone with visible highlights and shadows from lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject has a highly stylized appearance, with exaggerated highlights and shadows typical in illustrative styles, deviating from a natural skin tone portrayal.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the angle of the head suggests it is turned slightly to the right. This slight turn often implies attention or readiness in athletic poses. However, the lack of facial detail precludes confirmation of the gaze direction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
