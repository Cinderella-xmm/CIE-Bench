      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a tall, pointed spire rising from the center of the church roof, topped with a cross?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the center panel of the triptych artwork features a building with a tall, pointed spire. This spire is visually stylized and centered above the structure's central door. Such designs are typical in church architecture. However, the artwork does not depict a cross atop the spire, focusing instead on a decorative aesthetic with stars and a night sky. This artistic choice suggests simplification or omission of some real-world details like crosses.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a centrally located arched doorway beneath a triangular pediment on the main façade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an artistic representation of a building with a centrally located arched doorway in each panel of the triptych. These doorways appear beneath structures that could be interpreted as simplified pediments, represented more as arches with no distinct triangular pediment feature. The artistic style is more abstract and does not include specific triangular pediment detailing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the roof surfaces covered with red tiles, particularly on the main gable and side slopes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artwork depicts a structure where the roofs, especially the lower sections on each panel, are shown with a red color. This color choice is indicative of red tiles, a common roofing material in realistic architecture. Since this is an artistic illustration, the depiction of tiles is simplified to blocks of solid color representing tiled roofing. This indicates the presence of red tiles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there multiple arched windows visible on the upper levels of the church façade, arranged symmetrically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each panel in the triptych features a structure with arched windows. These windows are symmetrically arranged on the upper levels of the depicted building, which is typical of church architecture. The simplified art style uses basic shapes to signify window placements, creating a consistency across the panels.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the main body of the church constructed from light-colored stone blocks or masonry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the main body of the church-like structure using light colors that suggest stone or masonry construction. Although this is a simplified artistic illustration, using light yellow or cream colors typically indicates light-colored stone in art. This aligns with the realistic portrayal of such buildings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the church façade consist of a central section flanked by two symmetrical side sections, with a spire rising from the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is consistent with a design that features a central section, flanked by two symmetrical sides in each panel. The central section has a prominent spire, and the arrangement is mirrored across the triptych artwork. This symmetric layout across the three panels suggests a coherent design, typical of classical church architecture.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a cross positioned at the very tip of the spire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spire tops are depicted without a cross. The artwork focuses on a celestial theme with stars and a night sky, without including ecclesiastical symbols like crosses. In art, intentional absence is a common simplification choice for aesthetic purposes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the main entrance located directly under the central gable and aligned with the peak of the roof?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the structure's entrance in an aligned position beneath the central roof peak in each panel. This symmetry of entrance and roof alignment is a typical feature in church designs and is represented through the central placement in each artwork panel, reinforcing a balanced and traditional layout.",
