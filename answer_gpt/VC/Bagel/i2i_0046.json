    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the skater captured mid-air while performing the trick?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater is visibly suspended above the ground, with his knees bent, displaying the typical posture of someone performing a trick in mid-air. This visual cue, combined with common knowledge of skateboarding tricks, indicates that he is indeed captured in flight.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the skater's hat still feature the geometric pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a hat on the skater's head with distinct geometric patterns, suggesting a continuation of the design theme visible in the original Image A analysis. The consistency of design indicates the hat maintains its geometric pattern.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the skateboard positioned below the skater in mid-flip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B indicate the skateboard is in a horizontal position beneath the skater, showing signs of rotation characteristic of a mid-flip skateboard. Understanding the dynamics of skateboarding tricks allows us to interpret this placement correctly.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the building facades and tree branches visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays structures and tree branches forming the background of the scene. The recognizable outlines and color tones indicate the presence of these elements behind the subject, which is consistent with typical urban skateboarding environments.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a clear blue sky above the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top portion depicts a sky with hues of blue, clear above the trees and buildings. This suggests good weather conditions typically associated with a clear sky, supporting the conclusion that the sky is indeed blue.",
