      "question": "Does the edited image retain the green stem at the top of the orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain model includes a green stem-like feature at the top, imitating the characteristic found typically on fruits like oranges. Although it's a simplified representation, this part of the keychain corresponds to the stem area on the actual orange in Image A.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glossy texture of the orange still present on the keychain model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a keychain that is made of plastic with a matte finish, suggesting smoothness but lacking the glossy texture observed on the real orange in Image A. The orange's shine and light reflection are not replicated in the keychain's texture.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the keychain primarily colored in an orange hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the keychain in a more muted, almost yellow shade rather than the bright orange seen in Image A. This deviation in color can be attributed to either design choices or material limitations, resulting in a keychain that is not primarily an orange hue.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the surface imperfections and texture patterns of the orange persist on the keychain model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keychain in Image B features a uniformly smooth texture with decorative patterns, distinct from the natural irregularities and textures present on a real orange as observed in Image A. The surface imperfections and texture patterns typical of an orange are not maintained on the keychain.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the keychain maintain a proportional size and shape relative to the plate it rests on?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows only the keychain without any plate or context to compare size and proportionality, unlike Image A where the orange is positioned on a plate. Without a similar reference, it's not possible to determine the relative size and proportion of the keychain compared to a plate.",
