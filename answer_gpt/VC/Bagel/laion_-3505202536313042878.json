      "question": "Is the circular logo containing the text \"FIA\" and radiating lines present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on a stylized illustration of a man and woman with a border that resembles a postage stamp, set against a blue patterned background. There isn't any circular logo or radiating lines visible that are similar to the ones described in the question. The artwork is simplified and decorative, emphasizing the characters rather than specific logos or details seen in event photography.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no specific central logo visible. The design features a stylized representation of the couple, similar to a stamp, without specific text or event details. The emphasis is on a more abstract and artistic depiction rather than literal elements from a formal setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B simplifies the scene into an illustration without elements like a red carpet. Given the artistic representation that focuses on the individuals, the backdrop serves a decorative purpose rather than depicting specific environmental details. Red carpets usually indicate formal events, but the abstract design doesn't communicate that here.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is depicted wearing a black tuxedo, recognizable by the classic silhouette involving the jacket, pants, along with the stylized tie or bow tie visible in the illustration. The simplification to drawing maintains attire typical for formal events.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is illustrated wearing attire that gives the impression of a full-length gown. The simplified and styled representation hints at formal, elegant attire befitting of an evening event, though specific details like color are depicted in monochrome or limited palette. The context of a formal stamp design suggests evening wear.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration suggests that the woman is wearing a fur-like jacket, which is implied by the texture and style rendered visually. Such jackets are common over evening gowns for added elegance and warmth in formal settings, matching the depiction here.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not clearly show earrings or a clutch, focusing instead on a stylized depiction of the couple without certain accessories or minor details often seen in drawings.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artistic rendition of the man and woman reflects them standing side by side and facing forward. Their poses in the illustration clearly suggest a formal portrait arrangement, a common depiction in stamp-like art and stylized drawings.",
