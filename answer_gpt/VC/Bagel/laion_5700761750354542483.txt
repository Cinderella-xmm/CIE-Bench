    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the butterfly’s four-winged structure with two large upper wings and two smaller lower wings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly design indeed shows a clear composition of four wings: two larger ones at the top and two smaller ones at the bottom. This is a typical structure for butterflies, differentiating the upper and lower sections. This visual information is consistent with the general anatomy of a butterfly, which usually has four wings arranged in this way.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the butterfly depicted with symmetrical wings on both sides?",
    "explanation": "By examining Image B, the butterfly's wings appear to be symmetrical, as both sides possess the same design and pattern, a common trait in real-life butterflies for balance and aesthetics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a visible central body connecting the wings?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a central body part that connects all the wings together, which is a typical feature in butterfly designs. This body provides structure to the arrangement of the wings and is necessary for maintaining their organization.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a loop or attachment point at the top of the butterfly’s head?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are circular structures that resemble loops near the top part of the butterfly, directing attention to the design that might imply attachment points or decorative elements that could function similar to loops.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the butterfly positioned with wings fully spread in a flat, horizontal orientation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's wings are portrayed in a spread-out manner, laid flat and horizontally, which indicates a presentation of its entirety. This is a common pose to showcase the full beauty and symmetry of the butterfly's design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the wings proportionally larger than the body, matching the original scale?",
    "explanation": "The wings in Image B appear significantly larger than the central body, maintaining the proportional relationship expected in butterfly structures, where the wings take up the most visual space compared to the smaller body.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do the upper wings have a pointed tip and curved outer edge?",
    "explanation": "Image B's upper wings appear to have a more rounded rather than distinctly pointed tip, accompanied by a smooth, curved outer edge, drawing on design elements that prioritize a specific aesthetic rather than exact replication of pointed tips.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Are the lower wings visibly smaller and more rounded than the upper wings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lower wings are indeed smaller and possess a rounder shape compared to the larger upper wings. This aligns with typical butterfly morphology, where the diversity in wing size and shape helps in flight dynamics and visual differentiation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
