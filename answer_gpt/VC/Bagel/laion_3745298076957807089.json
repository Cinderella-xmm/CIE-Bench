      "question": "Is the bottle’s main body still a transparent rectangular glass container with softly rounded edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main body of the bottle is a rectangular shape with softly rounded edges. This is consistent with typical bottles used for storing liquids such as perfumes or oils, often designed to be visually appealing and ergonomic. The material appears to be glass, as indicated by the transparency and the way the light interacts with the surfaces, casting shadows and reflections, which is typical of glass. Thus, it retains the characteristics of a transparent rectangular glass container with softly rounded edges.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the interior of the bottle filled with a golden-yellow translucent liquid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the liquid inside the bottle is a vibrant green rather than golden-yellow. This vibrant color suggests a different type of content, often found in products like perfumes or scented oils, rather than the typical color associated with whisky or a similar beverage. The bottle's transparency allows the green color to be clearly visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the black box with the arched cutout and gold text \"CADENHEAD'S\" at the top and \"ESTD. 1842\" at the bottom still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no presence of a black box with the specified text and design. Instead, there is a decorative box with green and gold patterns, indicative of a luxurious or artistic design, which is different from the structured and formal appearance of the Cadenhead's box described. There are no texts like 'CADENHEAD'S' or 'ESTD. 1842' visible in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible reflections and highlights on the glass surface of the bottle indicating transparency and smoothness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible reflections and highlights on the surface of the bottle. These optical effects are typical of a smooth glass surface, which reflects and refracts light, indicating transparency. This aligns with the intended visual qualities of such containers to enhance appeal and suggest purity or premium quality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the bottle positioned to the left of the box, with the box’s arched window aligned to frame the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle is positioned to the left of the box, but the design is not as described with an arched window in the box. Instead, the box is decorated with an ornate pattern and lacks an arched window specifically aligned to frame the bottle, indicating a different design and function than what is described.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the bottle have a flat, thickened base that rests stably on the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle does appear to have a flat base. While the thickness of the base isn't directly measurable from the image, the design is consistent with the typical construction of glass bottles where a thickened base is used for stability and balance on flat surfaces. This ensures that such a bottle would rest stably.",
