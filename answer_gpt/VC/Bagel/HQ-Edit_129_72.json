      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is depicted as a phoenix with its face angled to the right, following the contour of its body, which is a common pose for portraying dynamic and fantastical creatures. This angle creates a sense of motion and drama, which is typical for a mythical bird like a phoenix.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feet of the bird, which is a phoenix, can be seen gripping the branch prominently. The design emphasizes its claws holding onto the branch, adding to its mythical and powerful appearance. This is a consistent feature in images depicting birds resting on branches.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the branch on which the phoenix is perched extends from the lower-left towards the upper-right of the image. This layout creates a balanced composition, often used to guide the viewer’s eye across the image effectively. It's a typical approach to enhancing the visual dynamics of the composition.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of snowflakes, there are fiery emanations and light effects present, which complement the depiction of a phoenix. This contrasts sharply with a wintry scene where snowflakes would be appropriate, aligning with the theme of fire and rebirth associated with a phoenix.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
