    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image preserve the multi-tiered, stepped gable structure of the church, with at least three distinct roof levels stacked vertically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure maintains a tiered design, characterized by multiple levels stacked atop one another. The typical feature of a multi-tiered, stepped gable silhouette is evident. The glowing symbols do not impede the visibility of the tiered architecture, indicating that the multi-tiered structure is preserved.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible carved wooden patterns along the eaves and gables of the church, even if overlaid with glowing runes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes glowing runes on the surface of the building, but these do not obscure the carved wooden patterns that are still visible. The patterns are integral to the architecture and craftsmanship, and they can be seen along the eaves or gables. The presence of glowing symbols enhances the visibility of these decorative patterns.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cross-shaped finial still present at the very top of the central spire, even if partially obscured by glowing celestial orbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure at the top of the spire does not show any clear cross-shaped finial. The glowing celestial orbs are prominent but do not partially obscure a cross, indicating that no such finial is preserved.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there horn-like or antler-shaped projections extending from the corners of the roof sections, especially at the top tiers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible horn-like or antler-shaped projections at the corners of the roof sections. The glowing symbols and design elements focus more on the celestial, mystical aspects rather than preserving typical architectural features like antlers.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a stone-paved pathway leading directly from the foreground to the main entrance of the church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict any foreground or landscape features around the base of the structure, including a stone-paved pathway. The image focuses solely on the vertical structure with mystical elements without external pathways or ground-level features, indicating a change from the original image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a clearly defined arched doorway located at the center of the front facade, accessible via a short flight of steps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure focuses on vertical tiers and mystical symbols, without featuring any obvious doorways or steps that were part of a traditional church structure. The central facade does not display an arched doorway, as the image is more abstract and fantastical.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there evergreen trees with snow on their branches and clusters of pink or purple flowering shrubs in the immediate foreground around the church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not showcase any immediate foreground with evergreen trees, snow, or flowering shrubs. The scene is devoid of such natural landscape elements, focusing more on the enigmatic and mystical aura around the building itself.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are snow-covered mountains visible in the background behind the church, with a body of water situated between the church and the mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any background details such as snow-covered mountains or a body of water. The presentation is more fantastical and centered on the structure with glowing elements, lacking any landscape scenery.",
