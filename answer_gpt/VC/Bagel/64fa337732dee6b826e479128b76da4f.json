        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's face is blurred and lacks distinct features such as eyes, nose, and mouth, making it impossible to preserve any original facial structure or positioning.",

      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman's hair in Image B appears to be styled in an updo, accompanied by decorative elements, but without the presence of a blue ribbon, as would be expected based on common aesthetic arrangements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress clearly features an off-the-shoulder design, revealing the shoulders, which is typically associated with formal or classical attire for women.",

    {

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any jewelry around the neck region, such as a golden necklace and pendant. The focus is on the attire without such defining accessories.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no rings are discernible on the woman's right hand or ring finger. The design of the chibi keychain simplifies details, often omitting small details like jewelry.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) seems to focus on the character representation and does not include detailed background elements such as a heraldic crest, which is often simplified or omitted in stylized artworks like chibi keychains.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's arms are depicted resting in front of her rather than crossed across her chest, which aligns with the typical positioning for such stylized keychain designs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image has a blurred facial area without visible eyes or a gaze direction, hence it is impossible to ascertain any focused forward gaze or direct eye contact with the viewer.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
