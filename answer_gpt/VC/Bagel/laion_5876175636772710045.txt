    "Question": "Q1: Is the man's left arm still wrapped around the woman's back, supporting her in a ballroom dance hold?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scene has shifted from a dance setting to a formal historical setting with a man and woman standing side by side.

    "Question": "Q2: Does the woman's right hand remain on the man's left shoulder?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are portrayed in a formal setting rather than engaged in dancing. The woman's right hand is not on the man's shoulder; they stand next to each other with refined posture fitting historical portraiture, lacking the dance embrace pose.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the woman's back arched backward with her right leg lifted off the ground?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a formal, stationary pose typical of historical paintings, with both figures standing upright. The woman is not arching backward nor lifting her leg off the ground, as the context has shifted to one of historical portraiture.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the man positioned with his back to the viewer while the woman faces slightly toward the camera?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both individuals are depicted standing and facing forward as part of a formal composition in a painting. The man does not have his back to the viewer, which contrasts with the dance scenario from Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the woman's long blonde hair flow outward to the right side of the frame?",

    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the man's left foot forward and the woman's right heel raised off the ground?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the formal position of the figures does not show dynamic movement; they are standing with both feet presumably flat and planted due to the nature of historical portraits, differing from any dance position.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the woman's head tilted upward with her eyes looking toward the upper left of the frame?",
