      "question": "Is the \"Indian\" script logo visible and legible on the fuel tank?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle is presented as a toy in a futuristic box titled 'FUTURE RIDER'. The branding details, such as the 'Indian' script logo, which would typically be visible on the fuel tank of a real Indian motorcycle, are not depicted here. World knowledge suggests that toy models often simplify or omit specific logos and brand names. Therefore, the 'Indian' script logo is not visible or legible on the fuel tank.",

      "question": "Are the engine cylinders arranged in a V-shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a toy model of a motorcycle. While the real object in Image A shows distinct V-shaped engine cylinders typical of cruiser motorcycles, Image B abstracts the engine design significantly. Toy models may depict general shapes without accurate technical details characteristic of real motorcycles, so the cylinders cannot be identified as arranged in a V-shape.",

      "question": "Are there two chrome exhaust pipes running along the right side of the motorcycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a futuristic toy motorcycle model packaged in a box. While the real motorcycle in Image A displays two visible chrome exhaust pipes, the toy model in Image B does not clearly display any chrome exhaust pipes, but rather a stylized feature that does not resemble the dual chrome exhaust pipes found on classic motorcycles.",

      "question": "Is there a black leather seat located above the engine and behind the fuel tank?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a toy motorcycle model within futuristic packaging. While Image A depicts a real motorcycle with a black leather seat, the toy representation visible in Image B shows a simplified seat design that lacks the realistic texture or clear material indication expected in a real motorcycle seat.",

      "question": "Is the fuel tank white and smooth with rounded contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toy motorcycle is displayed, and the model's fuel tank indeed appears smooth, white, and with rounded contours. This adheres to common toy design elements where simplified, smooth shapes, and bright colors are used to appeal to aesthetics.",

      "question": "Do the exhaust pipes connect directly to the engine block?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The model in Image B features stylized motorcycle components. While exact exhaust connections might be observed in a real motorcycle such as in Image A, toy models like the one in Image B typically do not accurately reflect such specific mechanical details like direct connections as the design is more abstract.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the motorcycle have a low-slung, cruiser-style silhouette with a forward-leaning stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a toy motorcycle model in a box. Cruiser motorcycles like in Image A generally have a low-slung, relaxed silhouette with a forward-leaning stance. However, the toy model isolates basic geometry, and while the form is slightly cruiser-like, without the real-world proportions, the stance and silhouette arenâ€™t distinctly identifiable as cruiser-style.",
