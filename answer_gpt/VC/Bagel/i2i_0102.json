      "question": "Is the pencil blue in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible pencil's body is entirely blue. This is concluded by observing the consistent blue hue along the pencil's exterior. Common knowledge tells us that this external color typically defines the pencil's color. We see no deviation from this blue shade, so we identify the pencil as blue.",

      "question": "Does the yellow paper have clean edges and a uniform color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the yellow paper shows straight and defined edges, indicating cleanliness. The paper appears uniformly colored without any visible shades or patterns interrupting the consistency. Hence, from a combination of the visual inspection and common understanding of what 'clean edges' and 'uniform color' entail, the answer is derived.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the pencil's tip visibly touching the yellow paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the pencil's tip appearing to make contact with the yellow paper. The visual alignment and meeting point between the tip and the paper are clear, indicating touching. Typically, this alignment in images suggests contact, leading to this conclusion.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a blurred silver laptop in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a blurred object resembling a laptop is seen at the top left, possessing a typical laptop shape and distinct silver-gray color. This shape and color inference based on knowledge of common office/laptop appearances allows us to conclude that there is indeed a blurred silver laptop in the background.",

    {

      "question": "Is the pencil's tip visibly sharp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tip of the pencil in Image B is well-defined and comes to a fine point, suggesting sharpness. The clear taper to the point confirms that it is sharpened. Typically, a pencil with such a pointed end is considered sharpened and therefore sharp.",
