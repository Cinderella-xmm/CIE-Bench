    "Question": "Q1: Are the elephant's tusks present and curved outward in a natural arc, extending from the mouth and tapering toward the tips?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant within the case has tusks that can be seen extending outward from its mouth in a curved arc. This curvature is typical for an elephant's tusks, which start wide at the base and taper towards the tips. Combining visual cues with common knowledge about elephants helps affirm this observation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the elephant's skin display deep, wrinkled folds across the forehead, neck, and body, consistent with natural elephant dermatology?",
    "explanation": "The elephant in Image B shows textured skin with noticeable wrinkled folds, which is consistent with real elephant skin. Elephants are known for their rough, wrinkled dermis, especially noticeable on the forehead and neck areas. Observing these folds confirms their typical dermatological appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the acacia tree present with a broad, flat canopy and extended horizontal branches above the elephant?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a tree alongside the elephant, but it is lacking the broad, flat canopy typical of an acacia tree. Instead, it has a more compact and bush-like structure, contradicting the expected flat and horizontal branch extension seen in acacia trees.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the foreground covered in tall, golden-yellow grass blades that extend upward and show subtle motion from wind?",
    "explanation": "The foreground in Image B, being inside a case, shows only a small patch of artificial grass that lacks the dynamic, tall, flowing blades seen in real environments. The artificial setting negates the impression of wind-swayed tall grass.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are snow-capped mountains visible in the background, forming a distant ridge line behind the elephant?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not show any background elements of the landscape such as mountains. Inside the case, there are simple cloud decorations, but neither the landscape nor any ridge of mountains is depicted behind the elephant.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the elephant's trunk curled at the tip and showing segmented ridges along its length?",
    "explanation": "Image B's trunk is not notably curled at the tip. However, it does display the segmented ridges known in elephant trunks, assisting in the perception of a realistic elephant design.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do the elephant's ears have a large, broad, fan-shaped outline with visible internal folds and a downward flare?",
    "explanation": "Image B portrays the elephant with ears that do not have the broad, fan-shaped outline; rather, they appear smaller and less detailed in terms of visible folds and flare. Such ears are not as prominent or detailed as authentic elephant ears.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Is the lighting consistent with a source from the upper left, casting shadows on the right side of the elephant and grass?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting within the case does not correspond deeply with any specific angles or directions like in natural settings. The enclosed environment of the case lacks real incident lighting casting notable shadows as seen in external environments.",
    "answer": "No"
