      "question": "Are there exactly two chalet-style buildings visible in the scene, positioned side-by-side on a snowy slope?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, there are no chalet-style buildings visible on a snowy slope. The image depicts a grand ice castle, creating a fantasy setting with an aurora borealis in the sky. The scene centers on a structure made entirely of ice, characterized by towers and pointed arches rather than typical chalet buildings. Based on this observation and knowledge of architectural styles, there are no chalet buildings visible.",

      "question": "Is there visible smoke rising from at least one chimney on a building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an ice castle with towers, consistent with a fantastical frozen landscape. There are no chimneys or smoke visible since the image depicts a structure of ice rather than conventional buildings with chimneys. Recognizing chimney features and their association with smoke in real-world buildings makes it clear that there is no smoke because there are no chimneys in the presented ice castle.",

      "question": "Are there multiple windows across both buildings that emit a warm yellow-orange glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no building with windows that emit a warm glow. The image showcases a frozen ice castle with intricate ice structures, where natural lighting and reflections would be expected, rather than a cozy warm glow from windows. The use of ice further emphasizes a cold setting devoid of warm window lighting, which is common in wooden chalets or houses.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there tall, conical evergreen trees with snow-covered branches visible behind and around the chalets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include evergreen trees with snow-covered branches because it features a large ice castle situated in a frozen landscape. The absence of trees, particularly snow-laden conical evergreens, suggests an expansive ice surface surrounding the structure, aligning with a fantasy realm where vegetation is minimal.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a large, snow-capped mountain peak visible in the background, rising above the treeline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a scene with an ice castle and aurora borealis without any mountain peak visible. The landscape around the castle is primarily flat ice, and the presence of a treeline is contradicted by the fantasy image setup. Therefore, a mountain peak, commonly seen in real-world snowy regions, is absent from this icy creation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there smooth, rounded snowdrifts in the foreground, casting soft shadows toward the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a flat ice surface with reflections from the tall ice castle, lacking the features of smooth and rounded snowdrifts. The visual cues relate mainly to sharp edges and vertical structures, instead of softer features like snowdrifts typical of snowy landscapes. Thus, there are no snowdrifts casting shadows as the surface appears frozen and flat.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a bright, circular light source (moon) visible in the upper-right portion of the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a bright circular light source is absent. Instead, the sky features an aurora, which provides diffuse and colorful lighting rather than a localized source like the moon. The aurora fills the sky with vibrant hues, and while it represents an impressive light show, it doesn't resemble the singular, bright moon typically illuminating the night sky.",
