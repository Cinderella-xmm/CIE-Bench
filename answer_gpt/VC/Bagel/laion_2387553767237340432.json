      "question": "Does the edited image retain the layered petal structure around the rim of each vase, with individual petal shapes clearly visible and arranged in concentric rows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, I can observe the vases with a layered structure around the rim resembling petals. The individual petal shapes are clearly discernible and are arranged in concentric rows, giving a decorative appearance. This suggests that the edited image retains the design element of layered petal structures.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image displays the interiors of the vases as being open and bowl-shaped. The design allows for clear visibility into their cavities, ensuring they maintain their functional appearance of being usable for holding items.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each vase is shown to have a distinct, flared pedestal base beneath the main body, which is more decorative in nature and supports the vase structure. This distinguishes the main body from the base design, which remains consistent between vases.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, both vases appear to be closely matched in shape and size. Their orientation seems the same, with slight flexing or tilting possible due to their positioning, which confirms their identical presentation barring any minor positioning effects.",
