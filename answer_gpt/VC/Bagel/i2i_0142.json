      "question": "Does the image retain the tan leather texture and black stitching on the glove?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows gloves in a brownish-orange color which seems to be an attempt to replicate a tan leather texture, but it is more vibrant than a typical tan color. The stitching is black as would be expected in a typical baseball glove. Hence, while the glove has black stitching, the leather texture appears unrealistic and lacks the authentic tan leather detail.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the baseball depicted in white with visible red stitching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the baseball is white with red stitching. This matches the traditional appearance of a baseball, where the contrasting red stitching is prominent on the white surface.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the top, side, and sectional views of the glove and ball preserving their respective 3D shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The images of the glove and ball in Image B are indeed in different orientations that suggest 3D shapes. The gloves appear from multiple angles, such as top and sectional views, and the positioning of the ball in the top right indicates a 3D form.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the views show the baseball and glove in a way that clearly depicts their association as sports equipment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a baseball and glove in proximity in different views, inherently associating them as they are commonly used equipment in the sport of baseball. The placement and context in each view make this clear.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image include a hint of a grass-like texture under the glove in at least one view?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is completely white, devoid of any grass or texture beneath the glove in any of the views. This environment does not match a typical outdoor setting where one might expect to find baseball equipment.",
