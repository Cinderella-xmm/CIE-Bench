      "question": "Are the orange fields with black veins and white spots along the wing margins present in the butterfly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly features prominently orange fields separated by black veins which are a characteristic of a Monarch butterfly's wing pattern. The presence of white spots along the wing margins further supports this observation. This matches the typical appearance of the Monarch butterfly wings as commonly recognized.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there clearly defined white spots located along the outer edge of both forewings and hindwings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are clearly defined white spots visible along the outer edges of the butterfly's wings, both forewings and hindwings. This pattern is characteristic of Monarch butterflies, which commonly display these spots alongside their vivid orange and black wing pattern.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the butterfly’s body black with small white speckles distributed across it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B has a black body with small white speckles, which is typical for a Monarch butterfly. These small white speckles on the butterfly’s black body are consistent with known characteristics of Monarch butterflies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a flower with a spiky central cone and drooping petals beneath the butterfly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beneath the butterfly, the composition features a variety of flat flowers and musical notes rather than any flower with a spiky central cone and drooping petals. This departure from Image A’s depiction suggests that this specific type of flower is not present.",
      "weight": 2,

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the butterfly positioned directly above the flower, with its legs touching the bloom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the butterfly amidst flowers and musical notes, but it is not positioned directly above any particular flower in a manner where its legs would be touching it. This arrangement contrasts with Image A, where the butterfly is indeed perched on the flower, illustrating a direct interaction through touch.",
