    "Question": "Q2: Is the sparrow's beak shape and size consistent with the original image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the beak of the sparrow appears slightly more stylized and larger in proportion compared to a typical house sparrow due to its cartoonish style. Analyzing Image A, the sparrow has a more realistic, well-proportioned beak. By comparing both images, the beak in Image B appears exaggerated, leading to the conclusion that it is not consistent with the original image.",
