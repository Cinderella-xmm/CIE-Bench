      "question": "Do the birds retain their original feather patterns including the brown and white colors and striated wing markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the birds can be seen with their distinctive feather patterns which include brown and white colors, as well as striated markings on their wings. These details are visible and clear in the image. By analyzing the feather patterns in Image A, they appear identical in Image B, retaining the intricate designs and color scheme.",

      "question": "Are the birds still perched on the branch with their beaks open as if singing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the birds are shown perched on a branch with their beaks open, which suggests they are singing or calling out. This posture is a continuation of what is shown in Image A, where the birds are similarly posed. The edited image maintains this specific behavior and positioning.",

      "question": "Is the branch still present with the same structure and positioning beneath the birds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The branch in Image B retains the same structure and positioning as seen in Image A. The branch arches in a similar manner under the birds, providing an identical perch for them. This detail shows continuity between the original and edited images in terms of the branch's form.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are leaves visible around the birds, although they appear slightly less prominent due to the change in background lighting. However, their shapes and positions relative to the branch and birds are mostly maintained as in Image A, although the contrast is altered due to the nighttime background.",

      "question": "Do the birds still exhibit the original lighting effects highlighting their forms despite the background change?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the birds highlighted against a nighttime starry background, suggesting an alteration in lighting from Image A's daylight setting. Despite this change, the birds are still illuminated, which highlights their form similarly to the original image. The lighting effect mimics the original's emphasis on the birds' contours and details, albeit adapted to a different background scenario.",
