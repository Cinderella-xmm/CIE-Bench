    "Question": "Q1: Are the black stripes evenly distributed across the body, head, and legs in the same pattern as the original knitted animal?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the animal is made of orange mosaic tiles with distinct dark lines on the edges of the tiles. These lines hint at a pattern reminiscent of stripes, but they are not distinct or continuous stripes as in Image A, where clear knitted black stripes are visible across the toy. Thus, the distribution is more irregular and interrupted by the mosaic tiles, unlike the smooth knitted pattern in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the snout present with two clearly defined, dark circular nostrils positioned symmetrically on the upper portion of the snout?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snout is made of mosaic tiles and appears largely orange-red with a few black tiles forming a triangular shape, resembling a nose, but there are no clearly defined circular nostrils as seen in Image A, where the knitted animal has very defined nostrils.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the eyes large, round, and positioned symmetrically on the face, each consisting of a white outer ring and a central black pupil?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes are prominently made of mosaic tiles and have a large, round shape, positioned symmetrically on the face. Each eye consists of a white outer area and a central black pupil, consistent with the expression seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the mouth a clearly visible curved line forming a smile below the snout, consistent with the original animalâ€™s expression?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mouth appears as a subtle configuration of mosaic tiles, suggesting a curved line similar to a smile. In comparison, Image A has a more defined and expressive knitted smiling mouth. However, both images show a curved line denoting a smile below the snout.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the animal in a walking pose with the left front leg extended forward and the right front leg grounded behind it?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the animal is standing on its legs, but it is not depicted in a walking pose. The legs are straight and evenly placed under the body, unlike Image A, where the knitted toy presents a walking posture with one leg extended forward.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there two small, rounded ears positioned symmetrically on top of the head, pointing slightly outward?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the ears made of mosaic tiles, rounded and positioned symmetrically on top of the head. They are slightly angled outward, matching the ear placement seen in the knitted version of Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the sculpture placed on a surface with a visibly granular, uneven texture resembling natural sand?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the surface on which the mosaic animal stands appears to be a uniformly colored, granular surface, which does not resemble natural sand in texture. Image A shows a background resembling a beach with natural sand. Image B lacks the variability typically seen in natural sand, presenting an artificial and even look.",
    "answer": "No"
