      "question": "Is the sandwich's crust depicted as having a golden-brown, crusty texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandwich's crust appears to be of a golden-brown color, which typically indicates a baked bread surface. The crusty texture is inferred from the visible roughness and color variation typically associated with such bread. The common sense understanding of sandwich bread contributes to recognizing this crust as golden-brown and crusty.",

      "question": "Are the layers of tomatoes, lettuce, and cheese visible within the sandwich?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, layers of red and green can be seen peeking out from the sandwich, suggesting the presence of tomatoes and lettuce. The visible layers and arrangement are consistent with how these ingredients typically appear in a sandwich.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the knife positioned parallel and adjacent to the sandwich on the parchment paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a knife visible near the sandwich. It is placed adjacent to the sandwich and oriented in a manner that seems parallel to the sandwich's length based on its alignment on the parchment paper. This positioning is typical when positioning cutlery alongside a food item.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the background show a detailed tablecloth pattern beneath the parchment paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a faint tablecloth pattern is visible beneath the parchment paper, although not highly detailed due to the overlay of a digital pattern that obstructs some view. The presence of any pattern implies a degree of detail, even if not fully visible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {

      "question": "Is the sandwich still resting on a clean sheet of white parchment paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the sandwich positioned on parchment paper, although there is some residue and a digital pattern overlay. However, the primary background surface looks like white parchment, which is typically used in food presentation to keep it clean.",
