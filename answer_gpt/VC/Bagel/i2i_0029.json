      "question": "Does the image retain the stark black-and-white contrast characteristic of the zebra's stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes are clearly distinct in black and white, which aligns with the typical depiction of a zebra's stripes. The black-and-white contrast is a common characteristic used to identify zebras. The visual cues in Image B show sharp parallel lines of black and white on the zebra's body, indicating that the stark contrast is retained.",

      "question": "Is the zebra's mane still upright and striped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's mane appears upright and maintains the striped pattern characteristic of zebras. Zebra manes typically stand vertically, featuring alternating black and white stripes that are consistent with the body pattern. These visual cues suggest that the zebra's mane in Image B retains its upright and striped appearance.",

      "question": "Are the zebra's ears still pointed and visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's ears are visible and have a pointed shape, which is characteristic of zebra ears. The ears are a significant feature used to identify the facial structure of the zebra. Based on the clear depiction of the ears in Image B, it can be concluded that they are indeed pointed and visible.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the zebra depicted in a grazing posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's head is lowered towards the ground, which is a typical grazing posture for these animals. Zebras often bend their necks downward to graze on grass, and the lower positioning of the head indicates grazing behavior. This posture is evident in Image B.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background still primarily composed of green grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background does not consist of green grass; instead, it features a pattern of black-and-white stripes similar to the zebra's coat. This stark change from an organic grass setting to an abstract striped pattern indicates that the background has been edited to align with the zebra's stripe pattern rather than remaining a natural grassy surface.",
