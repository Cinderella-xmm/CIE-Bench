      "question": "Is there a bench positioned on the left side of the porch, facing inward toward the cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is rendered in an abstract, geometrical style, making it hard to identify specific objects like benches. Without distinct details or recognizable features of a bench, determining its presence is not possible. Image A, by comparison, shows a clear image of the porch, including a bench. Due to the abstract nature of Image B, we cannot definitely state there is a bench in the edited image based on visual cues.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a large vertical glass panel or sliding door on the front face of the cabin, emitting warm light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is abstract and the details are not explicit, but there are structured shapes that may suggest the presence of doors or panels. However, due to the stylized depiction, there's no indication of warm light emitted, as color cues typically used to denote light are absent or differently used in the abstract form. Comparing with Image A, which shows a door with light, confirms that it's impossible to discern a similar feature in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a bright circular moon located in the upper right portion of the sky, above the distant hills?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a large circular object with concentric circles, potentially representing the moon. Its position aligns with where a moon might be in a night scene. Comparing with Image A, where a moon is clearly visible in the described location, the representation in Image B aligns with this concept. Despite its abstract style, the circular object signifies the moon's position.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there vertical wooden support beams forming the porch structure directly in front of the cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are clear vertical and slanted shapes that suggest the form of structural supports, like beams, despite the abstract portrayal. These shapes mimic those seen in Image A, where wooden beams are clearly part of the porch. The structured depiction aligns with the concept of support beams, evident even in abstract art.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there visible warm interior lighting emanating from within the cabin through the glass wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, due to its abstract presentation, lacks clear indicators of specific lighting conditions. The use of colors and shapes could suggest warmth, but there are no direct representations of lighting, like in Image A, where warm light is visibly emanated. In Image B, the absence of these cues leads to the conclusion that warm lighting isn't visibly represented.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there flowering plants with small white blossoms located in the lower right foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the abstract forms and colors do not distinctly represent flowering plants or white blossoms. The abstract imagery doesn't focus on specifics like plant details, unlike Image A, which shows clear plants with blossoms. Due to the abstract style, it isn't possible to confirm the presence of such plants.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there dark silhouetted hills or mountains visible in the background, below the moon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses layered shapes and color fields along the horizon line, which could imply silhouettes of hills or mountains in an abstract style. Comparing this with Image A, where such geographical features are explicitly depicted, helps to infer that Image B may be aiming to represent the same concepts, though stylized.",
