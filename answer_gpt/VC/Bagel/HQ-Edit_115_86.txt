    "Question": "Q1: Are the pointe shoes visible and correctly positioned on the ballerina’s feet, with ribbons wrapped around the ankles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ballerina is depicted as a cartoon character. Her feet are adorned with ballet slippers, which resemble pointe shoes. They are correctly positioned; however, since it's a simplified drawing, the ribbons are not explicitly shown as wrapped around the ankles. Instead, they are stylized representations of ballet shoes. In Image A, the ballerina wears pointe shoes with ribbons wrapped around the ankles. The cartoon simplification does not provide clear details like in the realistic depiction.",

    "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon ballerina has her hair styled in a tight bun at the back of her head, which is a common hairstyle for ballerinas. However, she does not have bangs; instead, her forehead is clear, with no hair covering it. In Image A, the ballerina's hair is styled similarly in a bun, but it cannot be determined if she has bangs due to the face being obscured.",
