    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the U.S. national insignia (white star within a blue circle, flanked by red and white bars) present on the wings and fuselage of the aircraft?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the aircraft is a model within a display case and features a design that includes stylized insignia on the wings. The depicted insignia is not detailed enough to confirm the presence of a full U.S. national insignia with bars, but only a simplified white symbol. The image suggests a stylized representation rather than a fully accurate replica.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there two radial engines mounted beneath the wings of the aircraft, one on each side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the aircraft model within the display case features a single engine at the front. The model plane is designed with a simplified version meant for display purposes and does not accurately replicate the historical configurations of real aircraft with engines mounted beneath the wings.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does each engine have a three-bladed propeller attached to its front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the aircraft model within the case has propellers with four blades, not three. This design is visible on one engine located at the front of the plane, showing clearly that each propeller is not limited to three blades.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a rounded, transparent cockpit canopy located at the front of the fuselage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cockpit canopy on the aircraft model is not transparent; it is painted in a solid color as part of a model display. The design offers a simplified or stylized look rather than an exact replica with transparent material for windows typically found in full-sized aircraft.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the wings extend straight and symmetrically from the fuselage, forming a dihedral angle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings of the model plane extend outward and downward without exhibiting a clear dihedral angle. They appear somewhat curved or angled naturally as part of the design, but do not visually align to an upward dihedral angle typical in real aircraft for stability.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the tail section composed of a vertical stabilizer and two horizontal stabilizers with small fins at the ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tail section of the model airplane appears to consist of a more simplified form that may suggest a vertical stabilizer with horizontal fin-like elements, but does not clearly feature small fins at the ends of the horizontal stabilizers. The model design is simplified for aesthetic purposes in the display case.",
