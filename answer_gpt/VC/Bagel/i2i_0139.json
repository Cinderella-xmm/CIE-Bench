      "question": "Is the carrot still bright orange in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot exhibits a vivid orange color, which is consistent with the typical appearance of healthy carrots. Bright orange is a common characteristic of fresh carrots, providing visual appeal and indicating ripeness. The color has not been altered or dulled in the editing process, and it contrasts sharply with the surrounding dark soil and green leaves, making it stand out prominently.",

      "question": "Does the carrot maintain its conical shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot displays a clear conical shape, characterized by a wider top gradually tapering to a narrower bottom. This is the typical growth form of carrots, designed to facilitate efficient growing in soil and effective nutrient storage. The definition of the carrotâ€™s form as conical remains unchanged from the anatomical standard seen in vegetables of this type.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the green leaves still present at the top of the carrot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The green leaves, often referred to as carrot tops, are distinctly visible and intact at the top part of the carrot in Image B. These leafy greens are structured as a cluster of stems and leaves, which are biologically essential for photosynthesis in carrot plants. Their presence continues to be a prominent feature of the carrot in this edited image.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tapered top end of the carrot with visible roots still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot is shown with a tapered top end where there are visible roots. These small roots are typical for carrots and signify the points where they draw nutrients and anchor into the soil. Despite any modifications in the surrounding environment, the roots appear unaltered and display typical carrot root characteristics.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the carrot still positioned upright in the substrate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The carrot in Image B remains upright, lodged firmly in the substrate. It is positioned vertically, signifying its growth direction and stability in the soil, which is consistent with how carrots grow naturally. Its upright nature allows for coherent growth and access to nutrients and water from the soil.",
