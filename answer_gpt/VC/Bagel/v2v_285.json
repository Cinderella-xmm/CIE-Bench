    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the large tree trunk with textured bark positioned on the left side of the image, partially obscuring the rear wheel of the bicycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree trunk is indeed positioned on the left side of the image, but it does not obscure the rear wheel of the bicycle. The trunk is next to the bicycle, but the bicycle is fully visible without any obstruction.",

      "question_id": "Q2",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycle is positioned close to the tree, but it does not appear to be leaning directly against it. The positioning suggests proximity without direct contact.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no road visible stretching horizontally in the image. Instead, the path appears to be a pink, carpet-like surface, enveloped in a more whimsical setting, not a traditional road.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycle is located near the left side, but there is no road with motorcyclists extending into the distance. The background consists of a path and other blurred figures, but not motorcyclists.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
