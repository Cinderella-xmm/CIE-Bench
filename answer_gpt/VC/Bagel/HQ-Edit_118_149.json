      "question": "Is the dancer’s left leg extended vertically upward in a full arabesque, with the right foot en pointe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain depicts a cartoon representation of a dancer with her left leg extended vertically upward, resembling a full arabesque. Commonly, this position involves one foot being en pointe, which is illustrated by the position of the right foot. Artistic simplification can represent ballet poses, so the representation aligns with the arabesque position. In Image A, the dancer's left leg was also extended vertically upward with the right foot en pointe, confirming Image B's accurate portrayal.",

      "question": "Are both feet wearing pink pointe shoes with visible ribbons wrapped around the ankles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cartoon dancer wearing pink pointe shoes, a common ballet shoe type. Typically, pointe shoes include ribbons wrapped around the ankles in ballet attire but artistic simplifications might not depict such details. Comparatively, Image A clearly showcased pink pointe shoes with ribbons, indicating realism, and while Image B lacks ribbon detailing, it suggests typical ballet footwear.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the dancer’s hair styled into a tight, round bun at the top of her head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's cartoon dancer has hair depicted as a rounded shape atop her head, typical of a ballet bun. Such styles are efficient for dance performances, suggesting the portrayal is intentional as per common ballet imagery. Image A further confirmed this, illustrating a tight, round bun concomitant with Image B’s representation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoon dancer in Image B is shown wearing a sleeveless pink outfit akin to a leotard, frequent in ballet costumes. The tight fit is implied by the close representation of form. White tights are indicative but not depicted explicitly due to artistic simplification. In comparison, Image A shows a sleeveless, fitted pink leotard paired with white tights, supporting Image B’s portrayal.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is one arm extended forward and slightly out to the side, while the other grips the barre?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the dancer’s arm positions: one seemingly extended forward and outwards, and the other bent upward, possibly gripping an imagined barre-like element considering realistic ballet postures. However, Image A shows distinct arm positioning—one steady with the barre grip—indicating deviation in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the dancer facing to the right side of the image, with her body in a side profile view?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the dancer facing right, with body positioning reminiscent of side profile view in cartoon artistry. This thematic representation matches the orientation assumed in ballet movements. Meanwhile, Image A illustrates similar side facing to the right with her body in a side profile view, affirming Image B’s directionality.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict any seam clearly, a typical detail missing in cartoon simplifications. Artistic cartoons often omit specifics like seams for clarity. Conversely, Image A does display a seam running down the center back of the leotard, marking a distinction between practical detail and cartoon abstraction in Image B.",
