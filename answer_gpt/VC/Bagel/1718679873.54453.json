      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the robot still have two distinct upward-pointing antennae on its head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot visibly has two upward-pointing antennae on its head. This can be distinguished by the protruding structures from the top of its head, which align with typical antenna characteristics, often used in robot and mecha design for aesthetic or functional reasons, such as communication or sensors.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a blue-tinted visor visible on the robot’s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's face shows a section that resembles a visor. The tint appears blue, which is emphasized by the contrast with the rest of the gray and metallic color scheme. Visor designs in robotics often serve as high-tech interfaces, hence the common representation with a blue or green hue.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there red glowing elements present on the robot’s chest and eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot possesses red elements on its chest and eyes. The glowing effect is depicted through color highlights that simulate illumination, suggesting functionality such as sensors or power indicators, which are consistent with design elements for robots to indicate active status or energy.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the segmented armor plates with visible panel lines and rivets still present on the robot’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot in Image B features a design with segmented armor plates, distinguished by lines and edges on its surface that indicate separation and articulation, typical in mecha designs to suggest robustness and movability. The visual cues of panel lines and rivets enhance the detail and realism.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the distant city skyline with tall towers and construction cranes visible in the miniature landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the robot in a display case with a miniature landscape, but the detailed skyline with towers and cranes from Image A is not present. Instead, it features a simple base with a few small trees, corresponding to a compact representation instead of a full-scale cityscape.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there small green trees present in the foreground and midground of the miniature landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot is encased in a dome with a miniature landscape that includes small green trees around the base, which help provide perspective and scale in such display settings. These trees visually replicate foliage and add a natural element to the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a visible dust cloud beneath the robot’s right foot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot is displayed in a static, miniature form under a glass dome, with no environmental effects like a dust cloud depicted beneath it. This differs from Image A, where a dust cloud suggests movement and interaction with a natural setting.",
