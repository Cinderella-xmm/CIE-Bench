        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible tube connecting the IV bag labeled 'BLUE IV' to the patient's hand. This is consistent with the common setup in a medical context where IV fluids are administered to a patient. The presence of the tubing visually links the IV bag to the patient's arm, indicating the connection.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nurse is depicted in an action pose that suggests interaction with the medical supplies on the cart. Her hands appear to be engaged with the items on the cart, aligning with a typical scene where medical staff are preparing or adjusting equipment.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows two medical monitors in the background, similar to Image A. These monitors display what appear to be readouts or patterns typical of heart rate or other vital signs, suggesting the presence of medical monitors in a clinical setting.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patient is depicted lying back on a bed with a relaxed posture. Without the ability to discern eye details explicitly, the artwork suggests a resting or asleep position, consistent with a typical patient resting state.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates an IV stand directly adjacent to the patient's bed. This placement is identifiable because the IV bag and tubing are in close proximity to the patient, as expected in a medical setting where an IV stand would be nearby for convenience and function.",
