      "question": "Does the chibi character maintain the exact martial arts pose, including the forward leg stance and outward-facing palms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character appears seated within a pink frame rather than standing, which is significantly different from a martial arts pose. The hands are positioned upward, which partially matches the outward-facing palms, but the leg stance is completely different as the character is sitting with legs folded. Therefore, the chibi character does not maintain the original stance.",

      "question": "Is the chibi character wearing a black outfit identical to the original, including the loose-fitting shirt and pants?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi character in Image B is depicted with a black outfit composed of similar elements to Image A, including a shirt and pants. Though the style is adjusted for a stylized character, the outfit remains close in design to the original, keeping with the loose-fitting appearance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B show a neat bun hairstyle. Although the chibi character has a simplification due to the stylistic portrayal, the overall hairstyle is similar, maintaining the bun at the back of the head.",

      "question": "Does the black outfit on the chibi character fit in a way that logically matches the martial arts pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character is sitting within a frame, and the outfit is depicted as loosely as in Image A, fitting with a stylized frame rather than a martial arts form. Therefore, it does not logically match a martial arts stance since the positioning is different.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi character in Image B wears a black outfit similar to that in Image A, with no added patterns or embellishments. The simplicity of the design is retained in both images, reflecting the same minimalist aesthetic.",
