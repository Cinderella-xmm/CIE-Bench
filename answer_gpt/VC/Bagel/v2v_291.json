      "question": "Does the edited image retain the hippo's large size and wrinkled skin texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hippo is depicted as a cartoonish character that generally reduces size for stylization. The hippo's size is not presented as large by real-world standards and lacks the detailed skin texture including wrinkles seen in Image A. The edited image aims for a more simplistic, smooth design typical in card illustrations. Comparing this to Image A, it is clear that Image B does not retain the original large size and detailed texture.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rabbit is depicted as a small and cartoonish figure with upright ears, which matches the general portrayal in cute character designs. The stylization retains the size and posture typical of rabbits, similar to Image A, where the rabbit is indeed small with upright ears. Both images maintain the small size and ear stance of the rabbit.",

      "question": "Does the edited image keep the hippo and rabbit positioned close together and oriented towards the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the hippo and rabbit standing close to each other facing towards the viewer, a common layout in character cards for clarity and interaction. In Image A, while the hippo and rabbit are depicted close, their orientation is more natural rather than directly facing the viewer. The edited image keeps them close and facing the viewer to fit within the card format showing them prominently.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hippo and rabbit exhibit a calm and friendly expression consistent with cartoon styling intended to be approachable. In Image A, the animals appear calm and relaxed in a natural state. The demeanor has been stylized to retain calmness with additional affability typically seen in card illustration designs.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain earthy tones that reflect the natural environment of the hippo and rabbit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prioritizes a vibrant and colorful presentation, common in card designs which employ bright and varied colors to attract attention, rather than earthy tones seen in Image A, which reflects the hippo and rabbit's natural habitat. The edited image does not maintain the natural earthy tones presented in the original.",
