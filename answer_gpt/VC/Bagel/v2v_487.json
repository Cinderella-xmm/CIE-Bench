      "question": "Is the kayak still bright yellow in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kayak appears bright yellow, similar to a typical kayak color often used for visibility on the water. Even in the format of a miniature or chibi form, the visual cues mirror what would normally be expected with a full-size version.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the black bungee cords in an X-pattern present on both ends of the kayak deck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, there are visible black bungee cords arranged in an X-pattern on the front of the kayak deck, but the back isn't clearly visible, so we can't confirm their presence on both ends from the image provided.",
      "weight": 2,

      "question": "Is there a black padded seat visible inside the kayak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of a black padded seat, a chibi figure is seated inside the kayak, which differs from Image A where a regular black padded seat is visible.",

      "question": "Does the skateboard have a dark gray grip tape surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a miniature skateboard, which maintains the dark gray grip tape surface typical of skateboards, as seen on a close inspection of the image.",

      "question": "Are the skateboardâ€™s trucks silver and the wheels tan in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the skateboard with silver trucks and tan-colored wheels, reflecting common skateboard colors even in its miniaturized form.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the kayak and skateboard aligned vertically and placed parallel to each other?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, both the kayak and skateboard are aligned vertically and positioned next to each other, which suggests they are parallel. The miniature format maintains this relationship characteristic of the full-sized version.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question": "Is the background a uniform neutral beige surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears as a beige surface within the frame of a photograph held by a hand, deviating slightly from the complete neutrality seen in Image A due to the inclusion of hands.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and presentation do not show definitive shadows to the left of both objects due to the framing and photographic style which differs from Image A.",
