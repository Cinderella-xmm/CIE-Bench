      "question": "Is the gray flat cap still present on the man's head, maintaining its original shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, analysis shows that a gray flat cap is present on the man's head. The cap maintains its original shape covering the top and extended bill towards the front. Recognition of a flat cap includes its characteristic low-crowned design and flat profile, which is consistent with what is observed here. The position of the cap on the man's head appears consistent with traditional headwear placement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the small brown leather tag visible on the side of the cap near the back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is no visible small brown leather tag on the side of the cap near the back. This conclusion is drawn from the lack of distinct details where such a tag would be located. In Image A, the tag is clearly visible, which highlights its absence in Image B.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the man wearing a heather gray crew-neck t-shirt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man appears to be wearing a t-shirt that visually resembles heather gray, a fabric that typically contains a mix of light and dark threads giving it a mottled appearance. The neckline suggests a crew-neck style, which is characterized by a rounded neck without a collar.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the man have a mustache and a goatee?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, it is difficult to determine facial hair details due to the artistic transformation and the blurred face. Thus, there are no visible indications of a mustache or goatee in this stylized representation.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the man shown in a side profile, facing to the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows the subject in a side profile oriented to the left. This inference is made based on the alignment of the shoulders, torso, and the assumed direction of the face relative to the cap's orientation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the textures of the cap and shirt consistent with a heather gray fabric (i.e., showing a mix of light and dark fibers)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artistic style alters textures significantly, creating flat, uniform color areas instead of depicting fabric texture. The concept of 'heather gray' involves visually mixed fibers, which is not explicitly shown in Image B due to the graphic style which simplifies to solid color tones.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the cap sitting naturally on the man's head, aligned with the contours of his skull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the cap is stylized but appears to rest naturally on the man's head, aligned with what would be the assumed contours of his skull. The capâ€™s position matches the typical alignment seen in similar headwear.",
