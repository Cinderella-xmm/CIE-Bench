    "Question": "Q1: Is the USB-C port located centrally on the bottom edge of the smartphone, flanked by two sets of three circular speaker holes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the smartphone indeed has a USB-C port positioned centrally on the bottom edge. The visual information confirms the presence of speaker holes flanking the port, evenly placed on either side, indicating a design choice commonly found in modern smartphones.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the smartphone placed diagonally on the wooden surface, with its bottom edge closer to the viewer than the top edge?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the smartphone is positioned with its bottom edge facing the viewer, which suggests that it is placed diagonally relative to the surface it rests on. This positioning helps in viewing certain aspects like the port and speakers clearly.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the wooden surface display a consistent horizontal grain pattern with warm brown tones and visible wood fibers?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not show a wooden surface with visible grain patterns and fiber details. Instead, the surface appears smooth with a rather uniform, warm color that doesn't distinctly indicate wood grain or fibers, likely due to the design context of an edited non-photorealistic background.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the background a uniform beige color with a soft blur effect, providing a shallow depth of field?",
    "explanation": "Image B has a background that lacks uniformity typically associated with a soft blur or shallow depth of field seen in photography. Instead, it appears smooth and solid, indicative of a digitally designed context rather than a natural blurry photographic effect, making it inconsistent with the description.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the mouse positioned to the left of the smartphone, with both objects resting on the same wooden surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mouse is depicted as a pixelated object to the left of the smartphone, and both items appear to be on an even surface. While the surface appears uniform in color, it isn't textured like wood, suggesting a digitally rendered environment rather than a natural one.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the mouse oriented such that its head is turned toward the smartphone?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the mouse with its head oriented towards the smartphone, as indicated by the direction of its eyes and general posture. This orientation implies interaction or attention directed at the phone, a common pose for symbolic engagement in design visuals.",
    "answer": "Yes"
