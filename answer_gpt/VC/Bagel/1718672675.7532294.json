      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible rock face of a cliff; the image depicts a large humanoid creature in armor surrounded by mystical blue swirls, not a landscape with cliffs. Thus, no sedimentary layers are visible.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses on an armored creature, with no water surface or boats included in the scene. The absence of any bodies of water negates the possibility of seeing boats in the distance.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
