      "question": "Is the dress clearly divided into a red upper section and a dark blue lower section, forming a visible gradient?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress is visually split into two distinct sections: the upper section is red and the lower section is dark blue. These sections are clearly separated, creating an evident contrast rather than a gradient effect between them. This observation is based on the sharp difference in color between the red and blue parts of the dress.",

      "question": "Does the dress appear to be in motion, with the fabric fanning outward and upward as if caught in a twirl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress appears dynamic, with the fabric noticeably spreading outward and upward, suggesting movement as if the woman is twirling.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's posture includes her right arm being extended forward and the left arm being raised. However, her left hand is not depicted as lifting the edge of the dress. Instead, the dress appears buoyant, floating around her, independent of her hands.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the source of light appears to originate from the top right, as evidenced by the illumination and golden glow cast on that side of the scene. The warm highlights on the women's dress and the top right side indicate the light's position and effect.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of Image B's visual cues doesn't allow us to confirm details of the woman's facial expression or accessories like earrings due to the blurred facial representation. Without evidence to substantiate the presence of closed eyes, a smile, and an earring, these details cannot be inferred with certainty.",
