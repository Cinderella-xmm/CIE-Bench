      "question": "Is the donut-shaped object retaining a circular form with a central hole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the donut-shaped objects are depicted with cartoon-like features, such as eyes and mouths, indicating a strong stylization. However, the base shape remains a circle with a prominent central hole, maintaining the fundamental form akin to a traditional donut. The portrayal of these features suggests continuity of the form, as a donut is characteristically known for its ring shape.",

      "question": "Does the donut retain its golden-brown baked color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color of the donut-shaped objects appears to maintain a warm, golden-brown hue, consistent with the baked appearance of traditional donuts. The cartoon-like characters have an orange-brownish tone that resembles the original golden-brown baked color seen in typical donut imagery.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the surface of the donut covered in visible coarse granulated sugar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the donut-shaped objects do not display any texture indicative of coarse granulated sugar sprinkled on their surface. Instead, the surface is smooth and stylized, characteristic of cartoon illustrations, which lacks the detailed texture present in a sugared donut.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible individual sugar granules on the donut’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the donut-shaped figures do not show any distinct or individually visible sugar granules. Their smooth, cartoon-stylized appearance does not feature the detailed granularity associated with sugar coatings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) portrays the donut-shaped characters as continuous rings with a clear central opening. Despite being stylized with cartoonish features, the central circular opening is distinct, marking them as ring-shaped.",
