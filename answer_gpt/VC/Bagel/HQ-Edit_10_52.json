      "question": "Is the woman depicted in an upright standing posture with her arms gently extended outward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's posture is clearly upright, and her arms are extended outward in a gentle and inviting manner. This is a common posture depicted in illustrations to suggest either a welcoming or an open stance. The execution of the posture is achieved by the correct proportion and symmetry of both arms extended outward from the body, which aligns with how arms are commonly positioned in an open gesture in artistic representations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is illustrated wearing a dress that prominently features a V-neckline and wide, flowing sleeves, which are typical characteristics of a traditional Hanfu attire.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows pink floral blossoms and green vine patterns embellishing the dress, which are central to its design.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress design includes a waist sash that is wide, however, it does not appear to have tassels hanging from it. The sash acts to cinch the waist, which is typical in many traditional clothing styles, but tack on embellishments like tassels is missing from this illustration.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B depicts bamboo stalks, but they are not arranged in a corridor-like formation surrounding the woman. The setting seems to be a simple backdrop that incorporates bamboo as a visual theme rather than a spatial arrangement like a corridor found in natural settings or traditional art that intends to invoke a specific ambiance or pathway feel.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is depicted with long hair, and it seems to be parted in the middle. This hairstyle is a common representation in illustrations and art for simplicity and symmetry, which is often used to frame the face evenly.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include a depiction of the ground covered in dry straw or mulch nor woven bamboo mats visible along path edges. The background consists of stylized bamboo imagery without these natural ground elements, focusing more on creating a visual representation of bamboo settings rather than including detailed elements of a forest ground.
