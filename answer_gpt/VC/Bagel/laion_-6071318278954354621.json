      "question": "Does the edited image retain the original woman’s facial features, including the shape of her eyes, nose, mouth, and jawline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's facial features are not visible. Her face is blurred beyond recognition. Therefore, it is impossible to determine whether the original facial features are retained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's skin tone on visible areas like the hands and neck seems different from Image A. In Image A, the skin tone appears natural and relatively fair, while in Image B, the skin tone has a painted-like appearance, indicating it has been altered.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is standing rather than walking, with both arms positioned downwards and her legs not in a walking posture, indicating a change from her original posture in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right hand is holding a fan and extended to the side, while the left hand is resting against the body. This differs from Image A, where the right hand is more extended forward and not holding any object.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's facial direction is blurred and indistinct, making it impossible to determine the gaze direction, so it cannot be confirmed whether she retains the same gaze as in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "explanation": "Image B shows the woman in a historical gown that alters perceptions of her body shape and proportions. Her slender frame and leg length are obscured by the dress, not preserved compared to Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the original volume and curl pattern of the woman’s hair preserved, even if partially obscured or styled differently?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
