      "question": "Is the sofa still black with multiple cushions evenly arranged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, observe the sofa's color, which remains black, indicating it has not changed color. Multiple cushions are visible, arranged symmetrically and evenly across the sofa. By combining this visual information with common knowledge of sofa arrangements, it confirms the presence of multiple evenly arranged cushions.",

      "question": "Does the painting above the sofa retain its swirling orange-red vortex design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The painting in Image B exhibits a swirling design with prominent orange and red tones at the center, gradually transitioning to darker colors towards the edges. This description matches the characteristics of a vortex design. By applying an understanding of artwork design and color theory, one can confirm that the painting retains its swirling orange-red vortex design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the painting still hung directly above the sofa?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the painting is located directly above the center of the sofa, suggesting that it is purposefully aligned in relation to the sofa's positioning. Applying common knowledge about interior design practices, which often place artwork centrally above furniture for symmetry and aesthetic balance, confirms that the painting is indeed directly hung above the sofa.",

      "question": "Is the wall behind the sofa a neutral light color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wall in Image B appears to be a light shade, which could be described as off-white or very light gray. This type of color is typically considered neutral, as it does not favor any strong hues. Drawing on knowledge of color categorization, this indicates that the wall is of a neutral light color.",

      "question": "Are there visible sunlight effects and shadows cast by a nearby window on the wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, light patterns and shadows are seen on the wall, suggesting the presence of sunlight entering from a window nearby. The angle and shape of these patterns typically reflect natural light behavior as it casts through windowpanes. This analysis leads to the conclusion that sunlight effects and shadows are present.",
