      "question": "Does the blue owl still have large white eyes and a yellow beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main owl has large white eyes, characterized by a prominent circular black pupil, which is consistent with many cartoon depictions of owls known for exaggerated eye features to emphasize their iconic wide-eyed appearance. The beak is stylized in an orange-yellow color, visually resembling the classic depiction of cartoon owls. Therefore, both large white eyes and a yellowish beak are present in Image B.",

      "question": "Are there still smaller owls present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, aside from the large central owl, there are smaller owls depicted. Their presence is identifiable around the central owl, hinting at a hierarchical composition that is common in visual illustrations whereby smaller figures denote subsidiary characters or elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'OWLEGORIES' is prominently displayed at the top of Image B in capital letters. This suggests continuity in branding or title presentation, often seen in series or products that aim to maintain recognizability.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visual indication of any owl figure holding a book. The focus is more on decorative and ornamental elements surrounding the owls, rather than utilitarian objects like books.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any call-to-action button like 'SHOP NOW!'. The composition is more aesthetic, focusing on artistic representation rather than functional, commercial elements which could include such clickable buttons.",
