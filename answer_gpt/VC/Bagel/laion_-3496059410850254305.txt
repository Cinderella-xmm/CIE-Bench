    "Question": "Q1: Is the Fender logo visible on the headstock?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the headstock of the guitar is clearly visible, and it appears to have some detailing that could represent a logo. However, there is a distinct graphic style present, and careful observation is required to look for a specific logo. The headstock design seems to have the standard arrangement of tuning pegs, yet discernible brand symbols are not distinctly visible, especially if represented in a stylized or simplified manner that might not include detailed branding.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are there exactly six strings running from the bridge to the tuning pegs?",
    "explanation": "Based on Image B, the guitar is held by a cartoonish character, and despite the comic-style exaggeration, the guitar retains a realistic representation of its components. Upon close inspection, there appear to be six strings visible, running from what is assumed to be the bridge to the area where tuning pegs are typically located. The standard design for guitars involves six strings, so the visual suggestion aligns with this convention.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is there a cutaway on the upper right side of the guitar body?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents the guitar as part of a stylized and exaggerated comic illustration. Despite the artistic style, the upper right side of the guitar body seemingly lacks a cutaway. Typically, a cutaway would be a visible indentation on that side of the guitar body, but in this illustration, the body maintains a more rounded shape, indicating no such feature.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the soundhole located in the center of the guitar body?",
    "explanation": "In the context of Image B, despite the exaggerated illustration style, there is a soundhole visible on the depicted guitar. This soundhole is positioned in a manner consistent with traditional designs, located centrally on the guitar body. The geometric center aligns with the expected placement on an acoustic guitar, indicating probable adherence to conventional design.",

    "Question": "Q5: Does the neck extend directly from the body to the headstock without significant deviation?",

    "explanation": "Considering Image B, the guitar body has a comic-style exaggeration but primarily exhibits a rounded lower bout typical of a classic guitar shape. However, the illustration does not indicate a distinct cutaway on the upper right side as would be observed in traditional dreadnought cutaway designs. Instead, it maintains a full rounded shape throughout.",
