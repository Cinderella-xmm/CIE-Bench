      "question": "Is the lifted foot placed on the inner thigh of the standing leg?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artwork depicts a traditional Indian dancer with one leg lifted to the opposite knee, rather than resting on the inner thigh of the standing leg. This pose resembles a classical dance position often seen in Indian cultural art.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "question": "Are the hands pressed together in prayer position directly above the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's hands are positioned with one arm raised and the other bent, rather than being pressed together in a prayer position above the head. The arm movements depicted in the image are more aligned with traditional dance forms rather than yoga postures.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the woman standing on a flat rectangular yoga mat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction is a traditional artwork, possibly on a mural or panel, without any indications of a yoga mat. The setting appears to be a part of a decorative traditional scene rather than a yoga studio environment.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the feet bare with no footwear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the dancer with bare feet, which is typical for traditional Indian dance forms, reflecting cultural authenticity in the depiction.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the eyes closed and the face relaxed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "As the face is blurred in Image B, specific details about the eyes and facial expression cannot be assessed. However, traditionally, expressions in classical dance are usually more expressive than relaxed, but due to lack of clear visual information, a definitive answer cannot be given.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the body upright and centered on the mat with no leaning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's pose is upright; however, the concept of being centered on a mat does not apply, as the depiction is an artistic one with no presence of a mat.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the arms fully extended upward with elbows straight and palms touching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's arms are positioned in different directions and are part of a specific dance gesture, rather than being fully extended upwards with straight elbows and palms touching.",
