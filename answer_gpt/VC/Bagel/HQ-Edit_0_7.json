      "question": "Is the parrot's head and chest covered in bright red feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parrot's head and chest are clearly depicted with bright red feathers. This is visually apparent as one of the distinct features of the parrot, aligning with common knowledge that parrots can have bright coloration. The edited image maintains the characteristic red feathers, typical of such a species.",

      "question": "Do the parrot's wings display a combination of blue, green, and yellow feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parrot's wings feature a combination of blue, green, and yellow feathers, which is evident from the multi-colored presentation of these areas. Parrots, especially those like the macaw, are known for their vibrant combination of colors. This observation is consistent in both the original and edited images.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the parrot have a long tail with distinct red, blue, and yellow striped feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parrot's tail feathers appear stylized without distinct stripes. The tail has a more abstract and artistic presentation rather than distinct stripes of red, blue, and yellow. This differs from the naturalistic depiction in Image A, where distinct stripes are visible.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parrot's beak is shown as large and curved, with a pale gray upper part and black lower part. This detail matches common characteristics of parrots' beaks, designed for cracking nuts and seeds. Both images maintain this natural depiction of the beak.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the parrot positioned upright on a branch, with its head turned towards the viewer, allowing for a view of its facial features, typical of a parrot's pose when perched. This maintained aspect in the edited image engages viewers by presenting the parrot's face directly.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the parrot perched on a stylized branch within the dome setup, without any visible green moss. The branch and surrounding setup are designed in a miniature style, distinguishing it from Image A where green moss is evident and adds realism.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
