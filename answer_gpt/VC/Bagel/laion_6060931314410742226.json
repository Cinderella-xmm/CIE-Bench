      "question": "Is there a large, fully bloomed white rose positioned in the bottom-right area of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is a mosaic art, and the roses depicted are stylized and not true-to-life representations, making it impossible to determine the color, such as white, due to the abstract and artistic style. The colors of the mosaic pieces are a mix of shades that don't represent real flower colors in conventional photography. There's no clearly defined 'fully bloomed white rose' in a realistic sense, especially not on the bottom-right area in the manner that could be interpreted from Image A.",

      "question": "Is there a pointed arch window with decorative tracery visible on the upper part of the brick building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a stylized mosaic art of rose flowers. The building in the background does not contain any detailed architectural elements such as windows with pointed arches and decorative tracery. The artwork emphasizes the mosaic rose design and not intricate architectural features. Therefore, the description of a pointed arch window is not applicable to Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the building have a visible corner formed by two intersecting brick walls meeting at a right angle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background depicts a stylized brick building with angular features seen in mosaic art. The building elements, like walls, are simplified for artistic representation, making it difficult to discern precise architectural details such as right-angle intersections. However, given the overall impression, a part of the design does suggest intersecting walls common in building corners, even if the detailed exact right angle is abstracted.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there at least three distinct rose buds visible along the stems, including one with pink tips near the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of roses in mosaic form does not include realistic details such as rose buds or color variations like pink tips. The roses and stems are rendered as part of an abstract pattern, lacking distinct rose bud features or color specifics that characterize buds in real-life depictions. Hence, it does not show detailed buds or pink tips.",

    {

      "question": "Are there dark green, serrated leaves present along the stems of the rose bush?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves along the stems are part of a mosaic, represented in a stylized artistic manner, which includes a variety of colors and shapes. They are depicted in blue-green hues with geometric patterns rather than realistic dark green, serrated leaves seen in actual rose bushes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the roses positioned in front of the brick building, creating a clear foreground-background separation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a mosaic where it visually suggests that the roses are in the foreground through the art style, with a brick building hinted at in the background. While this suggests a separation in terms of design, the abstract nature of the mosaic does not depict a realistic sense of depth found in a photograph. Therefore, while intentional with respect to artistic style, it doesn't achieve a realistic foreground-background separation as in conventional images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a tall, vertical brick structure (buttress or tower) extending upward on the left side of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mosaic design includes a stylized representation of a building with vertical elements. The abstract nature does not detail specific architectural structures like buttresses or towers with the clarity found in photographs. Nevertheless, the implied vertical structure on the left side can be interpreted as analogous to such architectural elements, even if simplified.",
