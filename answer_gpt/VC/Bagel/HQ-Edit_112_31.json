    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a white blaze running down the center of the horse's face from the forehead to the muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush toy is designed to resemble a stylized animal, likely a lion, given its mane. It has a central white patch on its face, resembling a blaze, but it's a feature of the toy's design and not a horse. A realistic horse would have a blaze from the forehead to the muzzle, but since this is a toy, the nature of this feature could be more abstract. Without Image A for comparison, and considering we're analyzing Image B, this is not a horse, thus this question doesn't directly apply to the image B's subject, which isn't a horse.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the horse have a large white patch on its left side, extending from the shoulder toward the flank?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object of interest is a plush toy, which has a uniform color, predominantly brown with some white areas, which tend to suggest a similar pattern but are not necessarily distributed like patches on a horse. Image B's object is not a horse, thus answering directly this question doesn't apply, but given the plush toy does not have distinct large patches, an analogy isn't evident.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the horse facing slightly to the left of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B on its own, the plush toy is facing directly forward, straight in view, in the box shown. Without seeing Image A, we interpret Image B alone, which depicts a forward-facing plush lion design toy. There is no visible angle that suggests any slight turn to the left or right.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there multiple dandelion seed heads visible in the foreground, surrounding the horse’s legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush toy box features some crafted dandelion-like decorations surrounding the base of the toy. These do not surround legs as they would on a horse but are decorated around the plush toy. Analyzing Image B alone doesn't show typical natural placement but indicates an intended setting. There are multiple dandelion-like figures present in the scene.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a forest of tall coniferous trees visible in the background behind the horse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the plush toy inside a decorated box with green cut-outs representing simplified trees in the background. These abstract representations do not suggest an actual coniferous forest but are rather toy decorations. Without Image A to compare, this interpretation considers design elements rather than realistic natural environments.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the sunlight coming from the left side of the image, casting a golden glow on the horse’s mane and left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no natural light interplay visible on the plush toy as it is primarily an indoor, controlled setting. Instead, the lighting in Image B appears even without any specific directionality, as befits a product display. This environment and the nature of the medium don't support analysis about sunlight like in outdoor photography of animals.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the horse standing directly within the field of dandelions, with flower stalks reaching up to its legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush toy is placed within a boxed setting that includes crafted dandelion representations. These are arranged around the toy, imitating an environment but on a different scale and context. Image B lacks the natural field setting that would correspond to how a horse stands in a field as depicted typically.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are both ears of the horse upright and pointing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B shows the plush toy animal with ears that are upwards, related to character design purposes. If questions pertain directly to horses, here specific animal anatomy logic cannot directly compare as the plush toy may follow stylized and abstract design elements. Based on Image B, the ears are indeed upward but in the context of this toy, not indicative of horse behavior or anatomy.",
