        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunflowers appear to have a realistic style, lacking the thick, textured brushstrokes seen in the original painting. The edited image integrates the painting into a modern setting, which suggests a transition from the textured art style to a more photographic representation. Thus, Image B does not show the characteristic brushstrokes of Van Gogh's style as evident in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the bright golden yellow color of the sunflowers preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited sunflowers on the table do retain the bright golden yellow color that is characteristic of sunflowers and matches what is often seen in Van Gogh's works. This aspect is maintained despite the changes in background and presentation of the vase.",

      "question": "Is the off-white and yellow color of the vase, including the handwritten signature \"Vincent,\" retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B shows that the vase retains its off-white and yellow color as in the original painting in Image A. However, due to the editing style, the signature 'Vincent' is not clearly visible or emphasized, which would be an essential element of acknowledging the artwork's authenticity and attribution.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image retains the positioning and arrangement of the sunflowers as seen in the original painting. They are arranged similarly, maintaining the same pattern and orientation that suggest the presence of Van Gogh's distinct style even when placed in a modern setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the natural placement and green color of the leaves and stems are preserved. This focuses on integrating the flower arrangement into a modern space while retaining the botanical characteristics evident in the original painting. The vibrant contrast between the green leaves and the yellow sunflowers remains consistent in both images.",
