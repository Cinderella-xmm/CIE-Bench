      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not provide visible cues of any earring on the left ear. The relevant area where earrings are typically present does not display any jewelry, thus the description of a silver earring with red gemstones and dangling parts is inconsistent with Image B.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands are depicted positioned around the pomegranate, demonstrating a clear grasp of the fruit. The placement of fingers and alignment indicates a firm grip, which is common when holding a round and relatively large fruit like a pomegranate.",
