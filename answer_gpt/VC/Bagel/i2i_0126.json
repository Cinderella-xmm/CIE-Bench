        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (second image), there are multiple scenes depicted in a collage format. In the top-left scene, two individuals are seated at a desk working on computers, which is evident from their posture and the presence of computer monitors. In the bottom-left scene, two individuals are seated again at a desk, further supporting the presence of two people working at desks within the image. Hence, the edited image includes such a setup.",

      "question": "Is the desk supported by chairs on both sides, and are both individuals seated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the top-left and bottom-left scenes clearly show two chairs with individuals seated at a desk. The chairs are positioned on either side of the desk, which allows both individuals to be seated and engage with their respective workspaces or each other. Based on this observation, the criteria of chairs on both sides of the desk with individuals seated are met.",

      "question": "Are there two framed portraits hanging on the wall behind the individual on the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, being a collage, lacks a consistent background across all scenes. The top-left scene does not show any framed portraits; however, to fully analyze the question in context, we need to ensure recognition of settings where portraits might be visible based on the spatial arrangement. With no portraits explicitly visible in the edited image, the comparison with the region where it would be is negative in relation to where they are present in the original image specifically.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, potted plants are indeed placed within each scene, visible at the sides of each setup involving desks and chairs for individuals. This indicates a consistent design choice of adding potted plants generally around the personnel and workspace setup, meeting the criteria of placement on either side of the working environments visible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the edited image, individuals in the top-left and bottom-left scenes are observed. In one of these scenes, an individual appears in an orange-colored top, but the question must take into consideration the configuration across scenes and attire differences. The individuals in one setup, at least, do not both match the description, suggesting a variance of attire across scenes, negating the full criteria.",
