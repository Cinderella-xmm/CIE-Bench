      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the flared leg silhouette preserved in the transformed design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design shows a flared leg silhouette with the bottom of the 'legs' widening compared to the top, echoing the bell-bottom shape that is characteristic of flared jeans. This is consistent with how flared jeans are commonly understood in fashion, thus indicating the silhouette is indeed preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the lace-up details present on the outer sides of the lower legs in the transformed design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the lace-up detail on the outer sides of the lower legs, similar to the original jeans seen in Image A. The presence of these lace-up features is evident in the edited image and aligns with the styling detail from Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the denim blue color retained in the transformed design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base color of the object is a shade of blue that is reminiscent of the original denim blue seen in Image A. Despite the transformation and added artistic elements, this essential color is consistently retained.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the side profile view maintained in the transformed design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a frontal view of the transformed design rather than a side profile view, which is evident from the overall alignment and orientation of the object. Image A, by comparison, shows the jeans from a side angle, demonstrating that the perspective has changed.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the proportional length and tapering from knee to ankle preserved in the transformed design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an exaggerated and artistic depiction, where the tapering from knee to ankle is not maintained in the usual sense, as seen in Image A with actual jeans. The proportions in Image B deviate from a realistic denim fit, which generally tapers slightly before flaring out at the bottom.",
