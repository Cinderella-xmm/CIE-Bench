      "question": "Is the mustache present and shaped in a way that matches the original image, with a curved, thick form extending from both sides of the upper lip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a chibi-style representation where facial features are simplified. The mustache is depicted as a curved shape under the nose, matching the style but not the exact form in the original image due to differences in art style. The original shows a thicker and more realistic mustache extending both sides, whereas the edited toy version simplistically suggests a mustache shape.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a plush toy with hair designed to mimic the iconic wild and voluminous appearance of Einstein's hair as seen in Image A. The toy's hair is styled with volume and extends outward, maintaining the characteristic wild, voluminous look associated with the original image.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toy's representation does not include visible portions of a light-colored shirt collar beneath the sweater’s neckline, unlike Image A where such a detail is subtly present above the sweater. This small detail is not replicated in the edited version.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a simplified chibi design where facial details like the eyes and forehead lines are stylized, not maintaining the original shapes. The toy's eyes and facial lines are designed differently from the realistic depiction in Image A, lacking the same shape and detail.",
