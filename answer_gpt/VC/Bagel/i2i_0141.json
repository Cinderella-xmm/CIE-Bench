      "question": "Are the silhouettes of the man and woman still positioned side by side on the bench after the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues indicate two figures sitting side by side, which appear to be a couple holding hands. This is inferred from the body posture and proximity to one another. Despite changes in the artistic style from a realistic to a stylized depiction, the positioning remains consistent. This assessment draws upon knowledge of common composition for depicting couples in art, where such arrangements are common to signify intimacy.",

      "question": "Is the park bench still present in the same design and position beneath the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows a stylized version of a bench beneath silhouettes, similar in appearance and functionality as seen in Image A. The change to a graphic representation does not alter its functional position relative to the figures sitting on it. World knowledge about the consistent portrayal of objects in art supports this reasoning.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the large tree with green leaves still visible above the couple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no indication of a tree with green leaves. Instead, the backdrop features abstract elements like red hearts, which replace the natural tree canopy seen in Image A. This suggests a transition from a natural landscape to a symbolic illustration, where common depictions in art replace such elements for stylistic purposes.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the grassy field still visible as the backdrop behind the bench?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The editing in Image B replaces the realistic grassy field backdrop with a more abstract and decorative red and black background. This is evident from the stylized and symbolic characters depicted, typical in graphic art, where realistic details are simplified for visual effect or emphasis.",

      "question": "Does the image still depict early morning or late afternoon lighting with soft diffusion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a color palette and lighting that indicates a transition from naturalistic to stylized, concentrating on vivid and contrasting colors instead of natural lighting. This deviation from soft diffusion in Image A suggests a thematic focus rather than a continuation of lighting effects.",
