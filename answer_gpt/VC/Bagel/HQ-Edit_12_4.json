      "question": "Is the watch face marked with Roman numerals from I to XII?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch face is clearly visible and the numbers marking the hours are in Roman numerals.

This indicates that the watch face is indeed marked with Roman numerals from I to XII.",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The watch face in Image B presents a classic, symmetrical form that indicates a constant distance from the center to all points on its circumference, which are characteristics of a circle.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows the top of the pocket watch with a wind-up mechanism known as a crown, which appears textured or knurled for grip. Additionally, a metal loop is attached to this crown, typical for pocket watches to facilitate attaching a chain. This confirms the presence of the described winding crown and metal loop.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For Image B, beneath the pocket watch, there is no visible fabric. Instead, there is a glass casing with books, a feather, and a detailed backdrop arrangement. Therefore, there are no embroidery patterns visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
