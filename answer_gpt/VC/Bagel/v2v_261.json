      "question": "Is the surfboard depicted with an elongated oval shape and a central stringer running along its length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the small figure is holding a surfboard which appears to be more stylized and toy-like due to its representation in a snow globe setting. Typically, a surfboard has an elongated oval shape with a central stringer running along its length, but in this artistic depiction within a snow globe, the surfboard’s traditional features may not be accurately represented in terms of detailed contour or stringer. The stylized nature doesn't clearly show these features usually found in realistic surfboard designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a small white wax block being held by the right hand and applied to the surface of the surfboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe representation is a cartoonish rendition of a scene rather than a realistic depiction. The figure inside the globe does not display any visible, discernible small wax block in its hands. The design is more simplified, thus lacking detail compared to a realistic setting where such tools might be shown.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the right hand positioned so that the fingers are gripping the wax block and making direct contact with the surfboard’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B's snow globe depiction, the figure’s right hand does not show any actions of gripping a wax block or making contact with a surfboard surface as such details are abstracted in this artistic, miniature context. The scene is stylized, devoid of such intricate interactions characteristic of real-life scenarios.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the left hand placed flat on the surfboard, parallel to the board’s surface, providing support?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, the snow globe figure’s left hand appears to be holding a miniature figure rather than being placed on a surfboard for support. The design emphasizes a symbolic interaction with another figure rather than a literal engagement with surfboard equipment, diverging from real-life actions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the surfboard’s surface show a granular, textured pattern consistent with wax application?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surfboard within the snow globe in Image B does not exhibit a detailed, granular, or textured pattern indicative of wax application. The globe is more figurative and decorative, focusing on stylized representations instead of realistic textural details seen on an actual surfboard’s surface.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the figure positioned in a crouched, forward-leaning posture with knees bent and upper body angled over the surfboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure inside Image B's snow globe appears seated and engaged with a miniature version of a person or character, which suggests a passive, seated posture rather than crouched or forward-leaning. This imaginative portrayal does not align with a dynamic surfing stance and thus differs from an active, real-life pose normally associated with crouching over a surfboard.",
