      "question": "Are there exactly four wooden trays arranged in a 2x2 grid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no clear depiction of wooden trays arranged in a 2x2 grid. Instead, Image B features a highly abstract and colorful design without discernible wooden trays. Thus, based on the abstract art style of Image B, we conclude that it does not represent four wooden trays arranged in a 2x2 grid. Since there is no representation of the tray layout according to the same criteria in Image A, Image B's layout confirms the answer as no.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the madeleines retain their distinctive shell-shaped form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pastries are represented as simple geometric shapes rather than retaining any distinct shell shape. The vibrant colors and lack of detail render it difficult to distinguish specific pastry shapes. In comparison with Image A, where madeleines are indeed depicted with their shell-like form, Image B does not represent these characteristics, so the answer is no.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the label reading \"Madeleine\" positioned near the tray containing shell-shaped pastries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not provide legible text or identifiable labels near the pastries. Compared to Image A, where the 'Madeleine' label is clear and located near specific pastries, Image B does not provide this textual information or organized tray layout, therefore the answer is no.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the word \"craster\" visibly engraved on the front of each of the four trays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's abstract visual style does not include engraved text or wooden elements as seen in Image A. The original image, Image A, shows 'craster' engraved on trays, but Image B's abstract representation omits these details overall, thus the answer is no.",

      "question": "Is parchment paper visible inside each of the four trays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs an abstract design with no discernible parchment paper. Comparing to Image A, where trays contain visible parchment liners, Image B lacks such detailed depictions, suggesting the answer is no.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show detailed pastries with an oval, slightly flattened shape; instead, it depicts abstract and simplified forms. In Image A, pastries in one tray appear oval, but Image B does not retain these specific shapes, leading to the answer being no.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the pastries in the bottom-left tray clearly shaped as sliced loaf bread with visible internal texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows abstract shapes without a clear depiction of sliced bread or detailed texture. Image A, contrary to Image B, includes slicings and texture in the pastries. Therefore, Image B does not display these characteristics, making the answer no.",
