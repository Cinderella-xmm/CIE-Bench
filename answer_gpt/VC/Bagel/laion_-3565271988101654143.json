      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the smartphone still a silver-colored device with a visible circular home button below the screen and rounded corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a smartphone with a clear blue futuristic interface; however, the visible color of the device itself is not silver. The design and presentation in Image B appear to involve a more advanced or conceptual design, potentially moving away from traditional aesthetics including the circular home button. The details such as the rounded corners of the device are consistent with many modern smartphones, but the coloring and button details don't match the description exactly.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the laptop retain its silver chassis, black keyboard, and visible trackpad below the keyboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the laptop retains a similar structural design to a modern laptop, but the depiction is highly stylized. The color and shape are not entirely traditional, and while it may have a silver appearance, the stylized design emphasizes futuristic and technological themes instead of typical color description.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hand anatomically correct with five fingers, visible fingernails, and a natural grip around the phone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand is holding the phone, but its appearance is embellished with holographic or digital overlays which may obscure or alter the perception of anatomical correctness. The presence of overlays makes it difficult to confirm whether the hand fully conforms to a natural grip, though the underlying hand shape suggests some anatomical norms.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the smartphone held directly above the laptop keyboard, with the hand positioned over the trackpad area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smartphone is in proximity to the laptop, but due to the stylized representation and blue holographic themes, it's difficult to provide precise positional descriptions as in Image A. The positioning isn't conveyed in a typical real-world sense that matches the given description exactly.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are horizontal window blinds visible in the background behind the laptop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B depicts a futuristic cityscape with tall buildings, and there are no horizontal window blinds visible. This setting contrasts sharply with interior settings that would typically include window blinds.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, blue is indeed the dominant color across both devices. The screens of both the smartphone and the laptop feature intricate blue holographic designs, making it a primary visual element in the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the futuristic alterations in Image B, the smartphone screen maintains a recognizable rectangular shape with rounded corners, which is consistent with many contemporary smartphone designs.",
