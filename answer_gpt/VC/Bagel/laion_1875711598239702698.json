      "question": "Is the trunk of each elephant still curved upward in the same manner as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both elephant-shaped objects are designed with trunks curling outward and upward in a stylized manner. This is similar to the typical depiction of elephant trunks. In Image A, the trunks are also curved upward in a naturalistic and ornamental way. Comparing both images, even though the representation has a more stylized design in Image B, the upward curve is similarly maintained in both images.",

      "question": "Are the ears of both elephants still present in their original flared shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ears of the elephant-shaped objects are stylized and appear to be part of the outline of the objects rather than distinct parts. Image A shows the elephants with distinctively flared and positioned ears. Upon comparison, the representation in Image B does not preserve the original flared shape and position of the ears as clearly as in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the oval-shaped mosaic pattern located on the back of each elephant, centered and bordered by gold trim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mosaic pattern is bright and colorful, covering the whole body of the bottle and not focused on the back or bordered by gold trim. In Image A, the mosaic pattern is oval-shaped, centered on the elephants' backs, and bordered with gold trim. The design and placement in Image B do not match the description from Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylization of the elephant-shaped objects may not include detailed elements such as tusks due to the nature of the design, which focuses on the mosaic pattern. In Image A, golden-colored tusks are clearly visible. Thus, in comparing the two images, Image B does not retain this feature.",

      "question": "Is there a decorative band with scrollwork pattern around the lower body of each elephant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on the colorful mosaic patterns on the surfaces and no decorative band with scrollwork is evident on the lower body. Image A presents the decorative bands with a scrollwork pattern on the lower part of the elephants. The representation in Image B does not display this feature.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design of the elephant-shaped objects portrays a very stylized form with minimal detail of facial features, focusing instead on the mosaic pattern. In Image A, the elephants have distinctively positioned eyes on the sides of the head, which are dark in color. Thus, Image B does not preserve this feature in its stylized design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two objects that appear to maintain a relative positioning similar to Image A, where the larger elephant is on the left and the smaller one on the right. Despite the stylization and functional shift in design, their relative positioning is still consistent.",
