      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the subject's hairstyle is notable; featuring platinum blonde hair styled with visible waves and braided sections.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the blurring effect on the face in the edited image, specific facial features such as the jawline and eye shape cannot be clearly assessed or identified. The editorial choice to blur the face omits these details and prevents accurate preservation or recognition of individual facial characteristics.",

      "explanation": "In the edited image, the subject is shown standing with hands clasped in front of the waist, suggesting a pose of composure or reverence.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts the subject with clasped hands, but there is no indication of a dagger being held. The hand positioning suggests an empty holding gesture, typical of formal attire or ceremonial postures, rather than holding an object such as a dagger.",

This arrangement aligns with traditional scenes depicting processions or organized formations, enhancing the visual symmetry and composition characteristic of historical assemblies.",
