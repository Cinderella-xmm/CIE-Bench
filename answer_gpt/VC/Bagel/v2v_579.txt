    "Question": "Q1: Is the central character (derived from the green block) positioned exactly in the middle of the composition, surrounded by other characters?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central character, visibly holding a green brick, is flanked by two red characters. These three characters are centrally placed within the image, suggesting that the central character is positioned exactly in the middle, surrounded symmetrically by two others.",
    "answer": "Yes"
},
{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the characters derived from the blocks retain the circular stud pattern on their upper surfaces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, two smaller characters visibly have circular studs on top of their heads, similar to the classic LEGO block pattern. These circular studs are a key feature of the original design and are retained in this depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
},
{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the characters derived from the blocks primarily composed of rectangular or boxy shapes, preserving the original block geometry?",
    "explanation": "The characters derived from the blocks in Image B maintain a boxy, rectangular form, as denoted by their angular and geometric shapes, which directly reference the LEGO block aesthetics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
},
{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the composition filled with a dense cluster of characters (originally blocks), arranged in a piled, overlapping manner?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the composition features three distinct characters against a backdrop of decorative hearts, but not in a tightly packed, overlapped arrangement. This indicates the characters are not clustered densely as initially presented in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
},
{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there only one character (derived from the green block) that differs in color or design from the surrounding characters?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central character associated with the green block is notably different in color compared to the two other surrounding red characters, denoting a distinct variation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
},
{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the characters derived from the blocks retain any visual indication of interlocking mechanisms (such as recessed areas or connectors)?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the characters, particularly the red ones, retain the stud features on top, but lack any visible recessed connections or additional interlocking features in their design, deviating from more complex interlocking patterns originally found in block mechanisms.",
    "answer": "No"
}
