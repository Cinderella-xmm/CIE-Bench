      "question": "Is the ornate bow with symmetrical scrollwork and central fleur-de-lis motif present and accurately rendered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a key as part of a miniature diorama, and its bow features elaborate, ornamental motifs with symmetric scrolls and a central accent, resembling a fleur-de-lis. This suggests detailed craftsmanship, aligning with designs often found in decorative keys. This element appears intricately rendered, consistent with such ornate design themes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the distinctive cutout pattern of the key bit, resembling a cross or puzzle piece, preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the key bit displays a unique cutout that bears resemblance to a puzzle piece design. This pattern integrates creatively into the setting, enhancing the thematic representation while maintaining the original cutout's distinctive look, which acts as a recognizable feature of the key.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the segmented fluted ridges along the shaft of the key retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the key shaft retains the segmented fluting that provides texture and depth to the design. This segmented pattern along the shaft is analogous to decorative keys and is clearly depicted, continuing the crafted detailing seen in the rest of the key.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the metallic bronze/gold color of the key preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the key exhibits a metallic hue that appears to be a blend of bronze and gold. This metallurgic coloration matches that of finely crafted keys, providing consistency in its aesthetic appearance with traditional metal treatments.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the bow positioned at the top, the shaft extending downward, and the bit at the bottom, maintaining the original vertical alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The compositional layout in Image B mirrors that of traditional keys, with the bow at the top, which elegantly transitions into the shaft and culminates at the bit positioned below. This alignment follows conventional key designs, preserving the original vertical orientation as seen typically in real-world key depictions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the vertical wood grain texture present in the background or hill surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible wood grain like in image A. Instead, the background consists of a diorama setting inside a case that visually shifts from a flat wooden background to a vibrant, diorama setting, indicative of a more creative and whimsical theme without the naturalistic wood grain texture.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is a visible shadow cast beneath the key, indicating its three-dimensional form and placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the key is integrated into a diorama that suggests a three-dimensional space, yet primarily focuses on the imaginative scene rather than the casting of defined shadows used to emphasize 3D form in traditional layout. Thus, while the scene is three-dimensional, it lacks the explicit shadow that would highlight the key's spatial presence.",
