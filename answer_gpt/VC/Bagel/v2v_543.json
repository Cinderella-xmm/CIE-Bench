      "question": "Are the characters still depicted as actively skiing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are transformed into stylized, cartoonish representations dressed in traditional Chinese clothing. Despite holding ski poles and wearing skis, they appear static and posed rather than actively in motion, which is typical of a cartoon or chibi-style depiction that prioritizes aesthetic over dynamic motion representation. This gives a sense that they are more for display purposes rather than engaging in an activity, thus not depicting active skiing.",

      "question": "Are the characters still arranged in a line formation while skiing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are standing side by side, forming a horizontal line across the image. This horizontal arrangement contrasts with any typical skiing formation where characters might be staggered to allow for movement along a path. This change suggests a static display rather than an active formation related to skiing activity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the characters still hold ski poles and wear skis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the transformation to chibi-style characters, they are visually depicted with ski poles in their hands and wearing skis on their feet. This retention of skiing elements suggests continuity from the original skiing theme even in their stylized form.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there still a visible snowy path beneath the characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backdrop features a snowy landscape with a general area of snow beneath the characters. However, unlike Image A, which clearly depicts a distinct path for skiing, Image B has a more decorative context without a specifically marked skiing track. The snow exists broadly rather than indicating a particular path, making it unclear if a specific path is meant to be represented.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the characters still moving forward along the path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the characters in a chibi style, where they appear static and positioned for display rather than in a context of movement. Their stance, combined with the cartoonish nature and the lack of dynamic cues, indicates they are not moving forward, thus differing from the movement implied in Image A.",
