      "question": "Is the rectangular wooden window frame with stone pillars on both sides present and unaltered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on the transformed creature, and there is no clear depiction of any window frame or stone pillars. The creature is standing on a stone platform rather than a windowsill, suggesting that any window frame that might have been there in Image A is not visible or has been altered. In my analysis, based on the lack of those specific features, it can be concluded that they are either altered or absent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the distant mountains and multiple upright cacti visible in the background beyond the window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a transformed creature with a desert-like backdrop but does not display distant mountains or cacti as seen in Image A. The background in Image B lacks such features, focusing instead on a sandy landscape. Therefore, these elements are absent in the edited image.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the shadow of the pot cast to the left on the wooden sill, indicating sunlight from the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the creature standing on a stone platform, without a wooden sill or a pot casting any shadow. The lighting does not provide evidence of a shadow being cast to one side, especially in the absence of a pot or sill, differing from the setting in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sky above the desert a clear blue with scattered white clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is not clearly depicted as it zooms in on the creature and sombrero, emphasizing the details of the creature and its hat rather than any distinct sky. Image Aâ€™s clear blue sky with scattered clouds is not visually mirrored in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the windowsill made of weathered wooden planks with visible grain and cracks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The setting in Image B is focused on the stone platform where the creature stands, and there is no windowsill, thus, the element of weathered wooden planks with visible grain and cracks does not appear.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B is indeed positioned centrally on a pedestal or stone platform within the scene, but it is not placed within a window frame or on a windowsill like the cactus in Image A was positioned.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the ground beyond the window a flat, arid desert terrain with sparse dry grass and shrubs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a view beyond a window, and the immediate setting around the creature is one of sandy terrain with no visible grass or shrubs, differing from the arid desert scene beyond the window in Image A.",
