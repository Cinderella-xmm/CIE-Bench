      "question": "Is the book physically present and open on the wooden desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a book is visually perceivable as being open on the desk. The visual cues such as the pages being spread open combined with common knowledge of how an open book appears leads to the conclusion that the book is physically present and open. The reasoning is based on recognizing the distinct visual characteristics of an open book.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the ornate brass desk lamp positioned on the left side of the desk, with its arm extended toward the book?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a desk lamp on the left side of the desk. The lamp is detailed with ornate features, and its arm is extended towards the book, which is a typical arrangement for reading. The observation of the lamp's position and orientation directly informs this analysis without needing comparison to Image A.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the desk made of wood with visible grain texture and located beneath all objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the desk features a texture that resembles wood grain, indicative of wooden materials. It is located beneath all objects: the lamp, books, and open book. The texture and positioning of the desk confirm this conclusion through visual observation consistent with world knowledge about wooden desks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the presence of two books stacked on the right side of the desk and one small closed book on the left. These arrangements are perceivable through the positioning and size differences among the different books, allowing identification through standard viewing and understanding of book stacking.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the lamp emit a focused beam of light that falls directly onto the open book?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lamp is shown to emit a concentrated beam of light that distinctly illuminates the open book. This observation is made based on the visible lighting effect directed at the open book, commonly seen in setups designed for reading or emphasizing particular items.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors in the scene warm browns, golds, and deep blues, consistent with a vintage leather-and-brass aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B predominantly features colors like warm browns, golds, and hints of deep hues, which align with a vintage leather-and-brass aesthetic. These color choices are discernible and suggest a classic, vintage atmosphere, confirmed through visual analysis and knowledge of aesthetic conventions.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the wall behind the desk dark teal in color with a textured surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall behind the desk shows gears and has a steampunk-themed design rather than a dark teal color with a textured surface. This observation contrasts against the description provided for this item, suggesting an error in the question premises. The visual analysis does not support the presence of a dark teal wall.",
