        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, observe the posture of the woman standing next to the white SUV. Her body is positioned against the side of the vehicle, implying she is leaning against it. The slight tilt in her posture and the relaxed placement of her hands further confirm this assumption. This visual cue combined with world knowledge allows us to conclude she is indeed leaning against the vehicle.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is clearly sitting on the hood of the white SUV. His posture shows that he is perched atop the vehicle, with his legs bent and positioned on the hood. The man is also holding an object up to his face, which, based on its shape and context, can be concluded to be a camera. This analysis is reinforced by the position of his hands and the context of taking photos at the beach.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the SUV appears well-structured and is taken as a whole without any apparent distortion. Its wheels are appropriately aligned and it stands firmly on the sandy beach. The position aligns with a common scenario of parking a vehicle at the edge of a beach, consistent with the original context.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains a backdrop that includes a beach scene, where we see sandy ground, waves rolling in from the sea, and a sky with scattered clouds. These elements are integral to beach photography, providing context to the scene as a serene coastal environment.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is dressed in a tank top and shorts, with a hat on her head. The man is wearing a long-sleeve shirt, shorts, and a similar styled hat. The clothing and accessories match the casual beach attire typically worn in a warm, sunny environment, and they are consistent with open-air and leisure activities like those seen in Image A.",
