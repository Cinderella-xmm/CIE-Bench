      "question": "Is the cluster of purple grapes visible in the basket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a glass bottle with a decorative design that features a duck and a cluster of purple grapes as part of the engraved design. The presence of the grapes in the design signifies its importance and contribution to the aesthetic of the object. However, there is no basket depicted in Image B, so the reference to visibility in a basket does not apply here.",

      "question": "Is the heart-shaped engraving present on the small terracotta jug?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on a glass bottle with a heart-shaped stopper, but there is no small terracotta jug depicted at all. The absence of a jug in the scene makes it impossible for there to be any engravings, including a heart-shaped one, on such an object.",

      "question": "Is the goose depicted with a white body, orange beak, and webbed feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a realistic depiction of a goose. Instead, there's a decorative motif on the bottle that portrays a duck, possibly inspired by the goose in the original image, positioned alongside grape imagery. The design is more symbolic and artistic rather than a lifelike depiction with specific colors like white body, orange beak, and webbed feet.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object depicted is a decorative bottle with no depiction of a cloak or similar garment. Therefore, there are no necklines or gold-colored clasps present in this image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) does not feature a basket. The design on the bottle only includes a duck and a cluster of grapes. There are no representations of any other fruits, such as a red apple or green pear, within this artistic layout.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has no depiction of a woman or a basket at all; it features a bottle with an engraved design. Since there is no basket or human figure in this image, the question of positioning near a waist or being held in an arm is not applicable.",
