      "question": "Does the image retain the visible cheese texture and layered shape of the chicken parmesan?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object that resembles chicken parmesan still appears to have a coating of cheese on top, but the detail is less pronounced compared to a typical representation. The image quality is reduced, and there are simplifications in texture, reducing the visibility of the cheese texture and layered structure that could be seen in a detailed depiction. Therefore, although there is some indication of cheese, the distinct visible texture is diminished.",

      "question": "Is the salad presented with discernible leafy green textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an area that is colored green, indicating a salad. However, due to significant reduction in image quality and clarity, the typical leafy texture and details expected in a fresh salad are not discernible. The visual cues don't provide enough detail to confirm the presence of texture indicative of leafy greens.",

      "question": "Is the milk carton still placed behind the salad?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the layout indicates a milk carton positioned next to a colored green area, suggestive of a salad. Despite simplified detailing and lack of precise clarity, the relative arrangement maintains the milk carton's position behind the salad area according to perspective in the edited layout.",

      "question": "Are the semi-circular orange slices with visible internal segments retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are orange-colored segments that indicate slices of an orange. However, due to reduced detail, the internal segments of the orange slices are either not visible or very indistinct, which does not retain the precise segmented appearance found in clear, high-resolution images.",

      "question": "Does the image retain the white plate against the orange tablecloth background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image in Image B does not clearly show a white plate; instead, the focus is on a blue background with text, indicating a design element change from the original presentation. The blue replaces the orange tablecloth, and there is no defined plate visible as a separate object within this new layout.",
