      "question": "Does the soccer ball retain exactly 12 black pentagonal panels and 20 white hexagonal panels arranged in a spherical configuration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer ball is illustrated in a comic-style, maintaining the traditional pattern of a soccer ball which typically consists of 12 black pentagonal and 20 white hexagonal panels. The pattern in the edited image suggests the presence of these panels; however, due to the illustration style, these panels are not explicitly counted but assumed based on the common design of soccer balls.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the soccer ball depicted as a three-dimensional sphere with curved surfaces and proper perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer ball is depicted in a comic-style which often uses outlines and shading to imply three-dimensionality. Although the illustration is not photorealistic, the ball's shape and the shading are intended to give the impression of a 3D sphere, with a visible curvature.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the goalpost maintain a rectangular frame with two vertical posts and one horizontal crossbar forming a standard goal shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the goalpost is illustrated with two vertical posts and a horizontal crossbar, forming a rectangle, which is the standard shape of a football goal. The drawing style uses thick lines to convey these elements of the goalpost.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the net of the goalpost composed of a visible grid pattern of intersecting lines forming square or rectangular cells?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the net of the goalpost is shown with a grid pattern. The lines intersect to create a series of squares, indicating the net typically used in football goals, although they are stylized and part of a comic-like representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the soccer ball positioned in the foreground, in front of the goalpost, with part of the goal visible behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer ball is indeed positioned in the foreground, with the goalpost visible behind it. This perspective is common in both art and photography to denote the placement of the ball relative to the goal, highlighting its prominence in the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the seams between the black and white panels of the soccer ball clearly visible and aligned with the edges of the pentagons and hexagons?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seams between the panels are depicted using black outlines that are aligned with the edges of the pentagonal and hexagonal shapes, in line with typical soccer ball design. However, due to the illustration style, the seams are simplified but retain the characteristic division between panels.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the soccer ball centered in the foreground and the goalpost positioned directly behind it in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer ball is positioned towards the center of the foreground of the image, while the goalpost, although skewed slightly left, is centrally visible in the background. This positioning gives prominence to the ball and maintains a clear visual relationship with the goalpost.",
