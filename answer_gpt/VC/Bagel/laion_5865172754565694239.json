    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the \"DUCATI\" text in white lettering clearly visible along the down tube of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycle has a cartoonish style with animated features like a face on the frame, compared to Image A's realistic depiction. The visual focus is on the animated aspects rather than text; thus, 'DUCATI' text visibility is affected due to its absence or lack of emphasis on the frame. Image A has a clearly visible 'DUCATI' text on the down tube, but Image B does not visually emphasize this detail.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the \"DUCATI\" text in white lettering visible on the seat stay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is stylized with animated expressions and sound effects coming from the bike, which draws away focus from brand text details such as ‘DUCATI’ on the seat stay seen in Image A. In Image A, the 'DUCATI' text was placed on the seat stay near the rear wheel. Image B lacks those specific details due to its cartoon-like rendering, emphasizing stylized elements rather than brand text.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the word \"SPORT\" in white lettering present on the top tube near the head tube?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top tube is animated, with no emphasis on realistic features like brands or model names often seen on bicycles, such as the 'SPORT' text in Image A. Due to the stylized and animated design focusing on cartoon expressions, these texts are not evident in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the word \"TECH\" in white lettering visible below the bottom bracket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the bicycle in a playful and stylized manner focusing on the personality of the object through animated features like a face on the frame. The 'TECH' text that might exist in a realistic context such as Image A does not appear in the stylized version. The cartoon rendering emphasizes animated effects, not text details.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the main frame of the bicycle predominantly red in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains a red color for the bicycle frame which mirrors the predominant color theme in Image A. Despite the shift to an animated representation, the primary color, red, remains consistent as the bicycle's framework, making it a recognizable feature.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the saddle and handlebars black in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the shift to a cartoon illustration, the colors of the saddle and handlebars remain black. This is consistent with Image A, where these components are black. The simplified animated design retains key color features for recognition.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the chain visibly connecting the front crankset to the rear cassette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chain is illustrated as a part of the bicycle but does not visually connect the front crankset with the rear cassette like in Image A. The cartoon style focuses more on expression and less on functional detail representing the connection effect.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Do both tires have a silver reflective stripe along the sidewall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses on a cartoon expression rather than realistic detail, like the silver reflective stripe along the tires in Image A. The tires in Image A have specific detail such as the silver stripe for visibility, which is not translated into the stylized version where tire features are simplified.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wheel hubs are portrayed in a simplified animated style with black coloring aligning with its cartoon representation, emphasizing a characteristic appearance compared to realistic detail in Image A. Hence, they are not prominently detailed or distinguishable, focusing on cartoon dynamics instead.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q10",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the diamond shape structure, similar to Image A, where the frame connects top, down, seat, and chain stays. Despite cartoon modification, the structural essence remains visible with clear frame outline cohesion.",
