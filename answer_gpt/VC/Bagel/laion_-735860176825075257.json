      "question": "Are the black-and-white half-timbered gable ends visible and positioned at the top of the central and right-side sections of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each of the three illustrations features a half-timbered design, characterized by a white surface with red timber framing. This design is typically found in traditional English and German architecture. The illustrations show these elements at the top of each building section. The contrast between the red and white makes this design prominent. Comparing with Image A, the visible rooflines in Image B suggest that these half-timbered gable ends have been retained in each section as a stylistic choice. However, the use of red in Image B replaces the black timber seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Is there a black arched door located on the left side of the building, embedded within the brick wall below the window ledge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, none of the illustrations feature a distinct arched door that can be recognized as black in color. Instead, red is the dominant color throughout the illustrations, and the door shapes are not explicitly arched as is characterized in Image A. Therefore, there is no clear presence of a black arched door similar to that in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the sign reading \"Leeds Parkway Hotel\" present beneath the entrance awning, aligned horizontally above the main doors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B consists of artistic architectural representations without explicit text detailing such as that found in Image A. The presence of a 'Leeds Parkway Hotel' sign, which is a specific textual element conscientiously placed in Image A, is not possible to ascertain from the abstract illustrations in Image B.",

      "question": "Are there rectangular planters with colorful flowers positioned along the base of the building, both in front of the black arched door and near the entrance steps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are indications of floral elements in various planters depicted in front of the illustrations. However, the color and precise arrangement are stylized and do not match the description of being rectangular planters directly in front of the black arched door or entrance steps as described in Image A. The imagery in Image B focuses more on capturing the general aesthetic than exact replication of such details.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there multiple windows with white frames arranged in grid patterns, including dormer windows on the roof and a bay window on the right side of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each illustration in Image B presents its version of architectural window designs. However, these are stylized and primarily feature red and white combinations. While windows are part of the designs, they don't mimic the grid pattern layout. Dormer and bay windows typical in traditional architecture, as seen in Image A, aren't explicitly detailed in Image Bâ€™s simplistic and artistic renderings.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the main entrance doors located centrally under the awning, consisting of two wooden doors with glass panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustrations prominently show central entrances with doors, but given the stylistic and abstract nature of artwork, these are depicted mainly in red and lack realistic textural detailing like wooden panels with glass. The abstracted doors are quite different in representation compared to the specific description of the entrance doors given in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the lower section of the building constructed from red brick, with an arched opening housing the black door?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lower sections in Image B illustrations utilize red as a main architectural feature rather than rendering realistic brick texture or specifically an arched black door design. Comparing with Image A, where red brick and an arched black door are concretely identifiable, Image B leans towards a stylistic interpretation that does not include such specifics.",
