    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the anvil present with a blocky rectangular base and a pointed horn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the anvil is prominently featured with a distinct blocky rectangular base that supports its structure. It also has a pointed horn typical of anvils, which is used for shaping and hammering various types of metal. This combination is consistent with traditional anvil designs used in blacksmithing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a glowing red-orange metal object resting on the anvil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image depicts a glowing orange flame emanating from the anvil, suggesting intense heat but is not the typical red-orange hue seen when metal is heated and placed on an anvil. Instead, this suggestive visual is more illustrative rather than one of an active work scenario with metal resting on the anvil.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hammer positioned above or in contact with the glowing metal on the anvil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer is held by the figure above the anvil; however, it is not positioned directly above or in contact with any glowing metal piece as there is none present. The hammer seems to interact with the overall thematic presentation rather than an operational action directly linked with heated metal.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are tongs visible in the blacksmithâ€™s left hand, holding the glowing metal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows the right hand holding an object, and the left hand seems to be resting naturally. No tongs are visible, nor is there an indication of the left hand holding any glowing metal piece, which aligns with the thematic nature of the depiction.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the anvil placed on a circular wooden stump?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the anvil is shown with an ornate base but lacks any visual cues indicating it is on a circular wooden stump. The setting is more illustrative, with an emphasis on its presentation style within the context of the depicted scenario.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a stone furnace with a glowing interior visible in the background to the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition involves an open book with script and ornamentation surrounding the figure, rather than a detailed background depicting a stone furnace with a glowing interior. Such a furnace can be observed only in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a second figure in similar attire standing near the furnace in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not reveal a second figure within its design nor does it showcase a background detailed area involving another character. It focuses on an individual figure with a distinct halo-like presence overshadowing a lack of any background personnel.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there arched stone doorways visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B centers around an illustration of a figure surrounded by open pages filled with script, without any architectural elements like arched doorways visible. The styling is more focused on creating an artwork piece rather than depicting an environment.",
