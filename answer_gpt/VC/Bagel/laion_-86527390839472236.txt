    "Question": "Q1: Are the original seam lines (including those around the front pocket and vertical panel divisions) preserved as embossed linear patterns on the transformed glass vessel?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass vessel displays vertical grooves, which are reminiscent of the original seam lines and vertical panel divisions observed in typical fabric suitcases. The craft and style of the glass suggest an intentional effort to mimic certain linear features, like seams from a fabric design, thus preserving the essence of the original design in the transformation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the brand logo positioned near the top center of the front face of the transformed object?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a glass perfume bottle, and the design does not incorporate any visible emblem or insignia on the glass surface. In contrast, brand logos on products like suitcases are often positioned either at the top or the center of the front. Since no such logo is visible on the bottle, the original brand logo’s placement has not been preserved.",
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the metallic spray nozzle located at the top center of the object, aligned vertically with the original handle’s position?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central metallic spray nozzle aligns with the perfume bottle's opening, typically at the top, a position that can be compared to the suitcase's handle which is also centrally located at the top. This arrangement emulates the functionality and design language of the original handle's position.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q4: Are four decorative caps present at the base corners of the transformed object, corresponding to the original wheel positions?",
    "explanation": "The base of the glass perfume bottle in Image B does not feature any decor elements mimicking wheels or base caps. In typical luggage design, four wheels are common for support, but the transformed object has opted for a clean base design, omitting such elements.",
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the two zipper tracks of the front pocket preserved as linear features on the transformed object, maintaining their parallel alignment and position within the front panel?",
    "explanation": "The transformed object in Image B displays vertical lines characteristic of a perfume bottle design, but they do not explicitly outline features like zipper tracks from the suitcase. Therefore, the zipper tracks from the suitcase's pocket are not preserved in the same alignment or style.",
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q6: Is a handle present on the right side of the transformed object, corresponding to the original side handle’s position?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle design does not include a side handle. Luggage often features handles for carrying, which might be on the sides. However, the design of the perfume bottle has omitted this feature, reflecting a different functional and aesthetic choice.",
    "answer": "No"
