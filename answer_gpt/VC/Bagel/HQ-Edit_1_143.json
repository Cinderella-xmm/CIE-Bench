    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the scientist depicted with her right hand holding a pipette or similar instrument, angled toward the test tubes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the edited image, the scientist is holding a pipette-like instrument in her right hand, which is slightly angled toward a diagrammatic representation of laboratory tools, including test tubes. This visual aligns with commonly depicted lab practices where instruments are held near work material.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there multiple test tubes arranged in metal racks, containing teal or greenish-blue liquid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features multiple test tubes prominently displayed, but they are part of a stylized representation and not directly associated with visible liquid contents as traditional photography would depict. Color coding, such as teal or greenish-blue, is not clearly discernible in this illustrated context.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a microscope visible on the right side of the workbench, with an eyepiece and stage clearly defined?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, laboratory equipment is illustrated abstractly in the background, but there is no clearly defined traditional microscope with an identifiable eyepiece or stage within the depicted material.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there two digital screens in the background displaying circular, intricate, symmetrical molecular or crystalline patterns in blue-green tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are circular patterns present, but as they are part of a stylized layout filled with scientific symbols, they do not directly mirror digital screen displays with intricate patterns typically seen in realistic settings.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the scientist wear a white lab coat and round-framed glasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scientist is depicted wearing a white lab coat and glasses. While the coat is standard for lab attire, the glasses are abstracted without specification for round frames, typical in digital or illustrated portrayals.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the liquids in the test tubes colored in shades of teal or greenish-blue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stylized image does not provide direct coloring of liquids as the representation focuses on the laboratory theme visually using abstract objects. Liquid colors like teal or greenish-blue are not explicitly presented in the test tubes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the scientist positioned in front of the test tubes, with the microscope to her right and digital screens behind her?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the scientist is centered with abstract representations of lab equipment surrounding her. These objects symbolize scientific activity rather than literal positioning with features like traditional microscopes or screens indicated.",
