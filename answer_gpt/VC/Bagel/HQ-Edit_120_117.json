      "question": "Is the red lantern room with glass panes and domed roof present at the top of the lighthouse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighthouse depicted within the globe indeed features a red lantern room with glass panes on top of its cylindrical structure. This is consistent with a typical lighthouse structure. The red color and design are visually clear, supporting this conclusion.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the lighthouse have a cylindrical tower with a tapering shape and weathered stone surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighthouse appears within a decorative globe. The tower is cylindrical comparatively sleek and uniform, but due to the stylization, it doesn't show a tapering design or weathered stone surface typical of older lighthouses. Instead, it appears more idealized and smooth.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a metal railing encircling the lantern room near the top of the lighthouse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a lighthouse inside a globe, which includes the feature of a metal railing around the perimeter of the lantern room near the top. This is common in lighthouse architecture for safety and maintenance purposes. The visual cues confirm its presence.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the lighthouse have a rectangular stone base with arched windows and a central wooden door?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighthouse within the globe lacks a detailed depiction of a rectangular stone base with arched windows and a central wooden door. Instead, the base is depicted as part of a broader rock structure rather than an architectural element. The focus is more on the tower rather than a distinct base with detailed features.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighthouse standing on rocky terrain within the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighthouse inside the globe is indeed placed on rocky terrain, as indicated by the stylized depiction of rocks surrounding the base within the scene. This fits the theme of lighthouses typically being located on rocky, coastal areas.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there waves depicted around the base of the lighthouse, indicating its seaside location?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows stylized waves within the globe, surrounding the base of the lighthouse. This artistic depiction indicates the lighthouse is meant to be by the sea, supporting the common lighthouse setting by coastal or maritime areas.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the windows on the tower arranged vertically with one small window above another, and an arched window on the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, within the decorative globe, the windows on the lighthouse are minimalistic and stylized, not distinctly arranged vertically in a traditional manner as described. The stylization simplifies features, focusing more on the overall form rather than specific window arrangements commonly seen in real lighthouses.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is there a wooden door centered on the front face of the lighthouse base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the globe depiction of the lighthouse does not feature a detailed central wooden door on a distinct base. The design within the globe opts for a more simplified stylistic representation, lacking this specific architectural detail.",
