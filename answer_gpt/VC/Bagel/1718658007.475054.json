      "question": "Does the edited image show the octopus with exactly eight tentacles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the octopus is illustrated with visible and distinct tentacles that can be counted. Since the image has a cartoonish style and large, exaggerated features, the tentacles are emphasized. Upon counting them carefully, it is clear that there are eight tentacles. This aligns with the common depiction of octopuses which are known to have eight tentacles.",

      "question": "Are there two distinct, large eyes visible on the octopus’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the octopus is stylized with large, cartoonish features, which include its eyes. The eyes are yellow and conspicuous on either side of the head, making them indeed two distinct and large eyes. This is a characteristic feature often emphasized in animated or cartoon representations of octopuses.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are suction cups visible along the underside of at least some of the octopus’s tentacles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoonish style displays suction cups on the underside of some of the tentacles. These are depicted as circular patterns along certain areas of the tentacles. This feature is commonly shown in animated images to portray the anatomy of an octopus authentically, as real octopuses do have suction cups on their tentacles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the octopus positioned on or adjacent to the beach, with part of its body in the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the octopus is depicted in a cartoon style positioned on the sandy shore adjacent to the water's edge. The background includes stylized waves and the presence of sand beneath the octopus, indicating its position adjacent to the shoreline. This composition suggests that the octopus's environment involves both beach and water.",

    {

      "question": "Is the octopus clearly the largest and most prominent figure in the image, facing directly toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central and largest figure is the cartoonish octopus. It dominates the composition due to its size and vibrant color, standing out against the background elements like the palm tree and the ocean. The tentacles and eyes are facing directly toward the viewer, reinforcing its prominence and focus in the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the foreground includes a visible stretch of sandy beach that extends to meet the stylized ocean water. This is an integral part of the setting in the illustration and helps convey a beachside environment essential to the visual narrative presented.",
