        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, which features a blurred face, does not show any horse. The focus of this image is on an object resembling a toy figure with construction-related elements in the background. Since there is no representation of a horse in Image B, the question about the horse's coat and mane does not apply.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any elements of the sea or a grassy shore. Instead, it shows a toy figure against a plain background with toy equipment. Thus, the background does not retain elements from Image A.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays an object that resembles a toy figure, with no indication of any buildings or background reminiscent of Image A's setting, which included a white house. Hence, there are no building or house elements visible.",
