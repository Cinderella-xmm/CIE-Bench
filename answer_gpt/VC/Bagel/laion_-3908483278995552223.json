      "question": "Does the edited image retain the trident with exactly three sharp, symmetrical prongs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trident held by the figure features three sharp prongs, which are a standard design for a trident. This is visually consistent with traditional trident designs where symmetry and sharpness are often expected. Comparing with Image A, the trident also has three sharp prongs, indicating that this feature was retained in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the geometric patterns (triangular and diamond-shaped plates) clearly visible and intact across the chest, arms, and legs of the armor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows smoother armor design without visible geometric patterns like triangular and diamond-shaped plates. Comparing this to Image A, where the geometric patterns are prominently displayed across the armor, indicates that Image B lacks these distinctive geometric designs.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hair long, wavy, and flowing over the shoulders, matching the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair appears long, somewhat wavy, and flows over the shoulders in a manner similar to that of Image A. This suggests that the hair's length and style have been preserved from Image A to Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the full beard present and clearly visible on the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a face, but the facial hair detail is not visible due to the blurring of the face. Therefore, it lacks visible features of a beard. Based on this, in comparison to the original Image A where a full beard is seen, Image B does not show a clear, visible beard.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the right hand positioned firmly on the shaft of the trident, gripping it in a dominant stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right hand is clearly holding the shaft of the trident, and it appears to be in a gripping position which is indicative of a strong and dominant stance. This is similar to the original Image A, where the hand also grips the trident, demonstrating consistency in posture.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the figure maintain an upright, heroic stance with the head turned to the left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure stands upright, and the body is slightly angled which can be seen as conveying a heroic stance. However, the head is partially obscured due to the blurring, making it difficult to confirm whether it is specifically turned to the left side. Comparing with Image A, where the head is turned to the left side, Image B may not explicitly show this detail due to partial obfuscation, but the general stance remains similar.",
