      "question": "Is the \"PARKING\" label clearly visible on the parking meter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'PARKING' label is situated at the top of the parking meter. The label is fairly large and placed within a transparent or semi-transparent section with a light background, which enhances its visibility against the darker color of the parking meter. The font is bold and easily readable, and the position allows it to catch light, further highlighting it. Given these aspects, it is clear that the label is designed to be prominent and noticeable.",

      "question": "Does the sticker on the parking meter display the text \"ComsiAcara\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sticker on the parking meter in Image B has multiple lines of text, and near the middle part, the word 'ComsiAcara' is prominently displayed in a larger and bolder red font, capturing attention. The overall lettering of the sticker appears clear enough for the main text 'ComsiAcara' to be distinguishable. This suggests that the text 'ComsiAcara' is indeed present on the sticker.",

      "question": "Is the parking meter securely attached and standing upright on a pole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parking meter is shown with a pole that extends downwards. The parking meter's connection to the pole appears stable, with no noticeable inclinations or irregularities that would suggest instability. The alignment and orientation of the entire structure give the impression of a securely attached and upright parking meter setup. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that the parking meter is securely attached and stands upright.",

      "question": "Does the parking meter retain its original size and structural proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the proportions of the parking meter seem consistent with common configurations such as the height relative to the pole and its width and overall shape. There is no evidence of distortion, resizing, or other alterations that affect its structural proportions. Its dimensions regarding the pole and overall scale appear to be standard for what would be expected of a parking meter. Therefore, the consistent size and proportions suggest that it retains its original form.",

      "question": "Is the shadow of the parking meter visible on the ground beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and position of the parking meter create a scenario where shadows would naturally be cast. However, in this image, the surface beneath the parking meter and further details of its surroundings are not defined clearly enough to discern a specific shadow of the parking meter on the ground. Without clear detail depicting a shadow, one can deduce that the shadow's presence might not be immediate or distinct.",
