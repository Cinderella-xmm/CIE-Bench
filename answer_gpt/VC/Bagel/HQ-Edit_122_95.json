      "question": "Are there two female figures present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are clearly two female figures depicted. They are positioned side by side, each holding a peacock and adorned in elaborate attire characteristic of artistic portrayals, indicating their presence in the scene. The visual composition suggests a deliberate portrayal of two individuals.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the two figures positioned symmetrically relative to the central axis of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figures in Image B appear to be positioned in a symmetrical manner relative to the central vertical axis. They are equidistant and facing directly forward, suggesting a balanced and harmonious composition.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a large central dome visible at the end of the pathway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no large central dome visible at the end of the pathway. Instead, there are smaller domed structures within the mosaic art surrounding the figures, but not aligned along a pathway extending to a single central dome, a setting indicative of painted mural designs rather than architectural perspectives.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there an arched stone entrance framing the view of the central structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a mosaic scene with arch-shaped outlines as a stylistic feature, but these do not frame a central structure in the realistic architectural sense. Instead, the arches serve as part of the decorative and symbolic elements of the mosaic art, not aligning or framing any structure in a traditional manner.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a straight water channel running from the foreground to the central structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, there is no depiction of a straight water channel connecting the foreground to a central structure. The artwork features a stylized and symbolic representation focusing on artistic figures and images, devoid of landscape architecture that includes pathways or channels.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the sarees retain a dominant red and gold color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a color scheme typical of mosaic art, which includes a variety of colors harmoniously blended into figurative representations without distinct attire like sarees having a dominant red and gold color as described in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are adorned with peacock motifs and have a more symbolic or iconic representation rather than detailed jewelry such as a maang tikka or earrings visible as conventional gold adornments.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Do both figures have long, dark hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figures in Image B have veils and are part of a mosaic representation where hair is not realistically depicted in terms of length or color choices that would be typical of photographic detailing.",
