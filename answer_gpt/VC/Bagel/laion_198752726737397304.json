      "question": "Is the rosette badge with the text \"GRAND CHAMPION\" and black-and-white ribbon design still present on the chest of the third individual?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area where the rosette badge was originally located in Image A now shows a cartoon-style depiction without any text or design similar to the original rosette. The outfit has been entirely changed to a stylized costume featuring a flower motif. This suggests an artistic transformation, eliminating detailed elements like the rosette badge.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts all individuals in a cartoon style, wearing superhero-like costumes, which do not show any real-world accessories such as the wristwatch originally visible in Image A. The cartoonish representation lacks such details, implying creative freedom was taken to remove such elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a transformation of the clothing and arm details into a cartoon character type drawing. This results in the omission of small real-life details like tattoos that were initially visible in the original photo.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is clearly stylized and retains elements from the original scene, including the presence of yellow daffodil flowers, which have been converted into cartoon form but are still visually recognizable as flowers.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By examining Image B's layout, the individuals maintain their relative positions from Image A, meaning the artistic modifications did not alter their sequence from left-to-right.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the scene is cartoonified, the retention of environmental features suggests the presence of the stone retaining wall, albeit in a drawn style, mimicking its original appearance from Image A.",
