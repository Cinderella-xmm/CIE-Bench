      "question": "Does the edited image retain the kitten's original orange fur with white markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible parts of the kitten show orange fur with distinct stripes, which are consistent with the markings seen in the original Image A. This suggests the edited image has retained the kitten's original fur color and pattern.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the kitten's greenish-yellow eyes preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes are not visible in Image B due to the blurred section covering the face and upper body. Based on the information that the eyes are beneath the blurred part, it cannot be determined if they are preserved.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image retain the kitten's perked ears, pink nose, and white whiskers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the perked ears and some whiskers. The pink nose is not visible due to blurring. Based on the parts that are visible, the ears and whiskers are consistent with what is seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a wooden floor background is visible instead of any blue blanket or soft texture, indicating that the environment has changed significantly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the kitten retain its relaxed posture while appearing to leap out of the screen in 3D?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the kitten in an active, mid-air leap, which contrasts with the relaxed, stationary posture in Image A. The dynamic action suggests it does not retain the original relaxed posture.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
