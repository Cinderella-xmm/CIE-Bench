    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the subject’s hair light blonde in color and visibly full and styled upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair color is obscured by a blurring effect, but it appears in a yellow tone similar to a cartoon depiction, indicating blonde hair. The style is illustrated as an upward direction which implies the hair is considered full. Thus, combining the cartoon style with common knowledge about blonde representation, the conclusion is drawn.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the subject have a prominent forehead and wide jawline that define the facial structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features are highly stylized and abstract, making it difficult to assess common facial features like forehead prominence or jawline definition. The blurring further prevents detailed evaluation.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the subject’s right hand raised with the palm facing outward and fingers spread in a waving motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited character's hand is raised with the palm visible and fingers spread apart, clearly conveying a waving gesture. The exaggerated cartoon style makes this action clear, and such a gesture is commonly associated with waving.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a necktie visible under the suit jacket, positioned at the front of the shirt collar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a necktie under the suit jacket, positioned at the typical location in front of the shirt collar with a distinct colorful pattern, true to cartoon representation of formal attire.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the subject in a bright-colored suit jacket with cartoon-like patterning, deviating from traditional formal dark suits. The underlying shirt is visible but does not match the description of a formal white shirt due to artistic styling.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the subject’s eyes directed forward, slightly toward the viewer’s left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has the facial area blurred in a stylized manner that prevents clear observation of the eyes’ direction, leading to the inability to determine the eye direction or alignment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the subject positioned centrally or slightly to the right of the frame, appearing to move forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the abstraction and stylization of the visuals, the character is positioned to the right side of the frame, indicative of moving forward suggesting an implied motion toward the center or up within the frame.",
