    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the capybara’s snout broad and flat with a rounded muzzle, consistent with its real-world anatomy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in the edited image, the capybara exhibits a snout that appears broad and flat with a rounded muzzle, which matches the capybara’s real-world anatomical features. Capybaras have distinctively shaped snouts, similar to the depiction in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the capybara’s ears small, rounded, and located high on the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the capybara’s ears appear small, rounded, and positioned high on its head. This is consistent with the real-life appearance of capybaras, who have ears that fit this description.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the capybara standing upright and facing directly toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the capybara in a posture that suggests it is facing the viewer directly. However, it seems to be depicted in a more anthropomorphic way by standing upright, which isn't typical of real-life capybara anatomy.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the capybara is illustrated with both hands in front of its chest, gripping what appears to be a drink. This positioning is visually clear from the image, emphasizing the anthropomorphic representation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the capybara’s fur primarily light brown with darker tones around the muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fur of the capybara in the edited image is predominantly light brown, with slightly darker tones visible around the muzzle area, consistent with the natural coloration found in real capybaras.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the capybara have a stocky, large body with short legs and a thick torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the body of the capybara appears more stylized and anthropomorphic than a realistic depiction, making it difficult to ascertain the stocky, large body, short legs, or thick torso usually seen in real capybaras. However, the representation may suggest these features.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the capybara have four limbs visible or implied by posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image presents the capybara in a posture where the forelimbs are clearly visible, gripping an object, and the standing position suggests the presence of hind limbs, thus implying the four limbs typical of the species.",
