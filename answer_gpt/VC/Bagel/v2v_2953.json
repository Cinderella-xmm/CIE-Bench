      "question": "Is the glass still recognizable as a standard cocktail glass with a cylindrical shape and a flat base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass is primarily constructed from clay and features an unusual hand-like design around its body, diverging significantly from the standard cylindrical cocktail glass. A typical cocktail glass has a clean, smooth cylindrical shape with a flat base, which allows for easy handling and stability. However, the edited clay glass visually has an irregular shape which appears more artistic than functional. Taking these aspects into account, the glass in Image B does not maintain the standard cocktail glass appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible ice cubes in the glass, maintaining the appearance of a chilled beverage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a clay model of a glass with no transparent elements or recognizable ice cubes. Real ice cubes in a cocktail are typically clear, angular, and partially submerged within the drink to give an impression of a chilled beverage. The lack of these features in Image B suggests that it does not portray a chilled beverage effectively.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a slice of lime garnishing the rim of the glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a piece of clay shaped to resemble a lime, but it lacks the essential qualities of a real lime slice. A typical lime slice is green and juicy, with a distinct texture and cut. While the clay model attempts to mimic a lime slice, the lack of color and fine detail makes it less convincing as a garnish.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a metallic straw inserted into the cocktail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Contrary to the realistic metallic straw in Image A, Image B features a clay piece vaguely shaped like a straw. Typically, a metallic straw has a shiny, rigid appearance with noticeable reflections that a clay rendition fails to capture. The material properties and visual cues in Image B starkly contrast the characteristics of a true metallic straw.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the surface beneath the cocktail retain a polished wooden texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface beneath the clay model does not display any characteristics of wood, such as grain patterns or a polished appearance typical of a wooden bar top. Instead, the surface appears plain and lacks texture, indicating no resemblance to wood.",
