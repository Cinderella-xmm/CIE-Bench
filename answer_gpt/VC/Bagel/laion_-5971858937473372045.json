        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are three distinct figures, two on either side of the central figure. The dresses and hairstyles clearly identify them as women. Based on the attire and positioning, it's reasonable to conclude that there are exactly three women present.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each woman holds a bouquet with both hands placed in front of their bodies, which is a traditional pose often depicted historically and in portraiture settings.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) portrays all three women standing in a frontal position, facing forward, which implies they are directly facing the viewer, similar to traditional portrait styles.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the women are shown in a full-body depiction, standing upright. The historical attire and posture suggest a formal stance typical of portraiture that captures the entire figure from head to toe.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central woman's face is not visible, hence determining the specifics of her expression, such as a wide, open-mouthed smile showing teeth, is not feasible.",
