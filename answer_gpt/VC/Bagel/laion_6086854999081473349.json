      "question": "Are the two garage doors positioned side by side on the lower front portion of the cabin, directly beneath the large upper window section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cabin features bright green glowing faces across its facade, replacing any traditional architectural elements. Instead of garage doors, these glowing panels are present, which indicates that the traditional garage doors are absent. By comparing Image A, we see two traditional garage doors side by side on the lower front portion. They are directly beneath a large window section, which is visible. However, in Image B, these elements have been replaced, meaning the original positioning of side-by-side garage doors does not apply to the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a large, multi-pane window section with exposed wooden beams located directly above the two garage doors, spanning most of the front width of the cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a fanciful design with glowing faces and vine-like decorations covering the front facade, with no recognizable windows or wooden beams observable. This whimsical transformation has entirely replaced traditional cabin features. Referring to Image A, there's a large wooden frame that might suggest a window section, but it is absent in Image B, thus the characteristic of spanning most of the width with a window section does not apply.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a small rectangular window cut into the log wall on the left side of the cabin, near the front corner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a creative structure adorned with illuminated faces and tree-like decorations. These alterations cover any semblance of traditional window structures that might exist in a typical cabin wall. In contrast, Image A has a small rectangular window fitting this description, but the extravagant changes in Image B mean that such identical features no longer exist in this edited scenario.",

      "question": "Is there a doorway located immediately to the right of the small rectangular window on the left side of the cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the extravagant design completely masks any conventional architectural features with glowing visuals and carved designs. Image A reveals a potential doorway placement near its window, but these details are obscured under the unconventional design of Image B, negating the presence of a similar doorway.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a continuous concrete foundation base running beneath the log walls of the cabin, visible along the lower perimeter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a creative transformation with mystical elements covering the lower perimeter, obscuring parts of the building structure entirely, including the base foundation. Image A has a concrete foundation visible below the log construction. The aesthetic creativity in Image B alters this completely, eliminating visibility of any concrete foundation base.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the cabin oriented such that its front fa√ßade is angled slightly toward the right side of the image, with the left side receding into the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B feature a building where the front facade is angled slightly toward the right. Despite the comprehensive artistic edits in Image B, the overall orientation of the facade remains unchanged. Comparing initial image A to Image B, despite the surrounding visual changes, reveals that the orientation in both remains consistent.",
