      "question": "Is the clock face present with Roman numerals I through XII arranged in a circle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face is visible and includes Roman numerals arranged in a circle, which is a common design for clock faces to denote time. The numerals I through XII are typically used around the clock face, with each numeral indicating an hour. This arrangement is confirmed by visual inspection.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the clock face located directly above the central arched opening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face is positioned directly above a central arched opening, as visible in the image. The structure has a distinct placement where the circular clock face sits atop the arch, serving as a prominent focal point of the tower's design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the top of the tower feature a pointed gable with finials at each corner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the top of the tower with a gable that appears pointed, as part of its architectural style. There are raised elements at each corner, which can be interpreted as finials, a detail used in classical architecture to enhance aesthetics.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there two arched windows on the left and right sides of the tower, positioned symmetrically below the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of two arched windows on either side of the tower below the clock face is not evident. The visual structure shows symmetry in design, but the arches are more related to disrepair, and there is no clear indication of arched windows beneath the clock face specifically.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the undamaged stone surface of the tower uniformly light gray with visible cracks and rough texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone surface of the tower is light gray with a rough texture and visible cracks throughout. This contributes to a weathered appearance common in aged stone structures, indicating wear but not uniform undamage.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there an intact arched opening directly above the clock face, forming a decorative frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that above the clock face, there is no intact arched opening serving as a decorative frame. Instead, the architecture shows signs of damage and lack of symmetry directly above the clock face.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the tower maintain a tall, narrow vertical profile with distinct horizontal divisions at the base, middle, and top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower retains a tall and narrow vertical profile typical of clock towers, with visible horizontal divisions marking different sections such as the base, middle, and top. This architectural design helps in emphasizing the tower's height and verticality.",
      "weight": 2,
