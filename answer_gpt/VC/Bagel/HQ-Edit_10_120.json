      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the facial expression cannot be assessed due to the blur applied over the face area. In images with such blurring, details like expressions and wrinkles are typically obscured and not preserved.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a blur over the face, but the outline of the glasses can still be discerned, suggesting they are in a similar position as in the original image. However, details like tint are not verifiable due to the blur.",

    },
    {
