    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the dark brown tree branch on which the bird is perched clearly visible and positioned in the same location as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dark brown tree branch on which the bird is perched appears to be in a similar location to where it was in Image A—the lower central part of the image. The branch appears to have a texture resembling the one in Image A, although Image B features a more fantastical appearance due to the transformation effect on the bird. Given these observations, the branch is likely in the same position.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the pink five-petaled cherry blossoms with visible yellow stamens and red centers still present in the scene, particularly near the bird and along the branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pink flowers with five petals are still visible near the branches and the bird. This suggests that the cherry blossoms are still present in the edited scene, with similar characteristics as in Image A, even though the bird itself has undergone a significant transformation.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the bird (or its transformed spirit form) positioned on the same branch, in the same central-left location, facing toward the left side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed bird is indeed positioned on what appears to be the same branch, located near the central-left area of the frame. The orientation of the bird, facing towards the left side of the frame, remains consistent between the two images. Despite the bird’s fantastical appearance in Image B, its position and orientation have not changed.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there fresh green leaves with curled tips and visible veins growing from the branches, particularly near the bird and in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not prominently feature fresh green leaves with curled tips and visible veins. The visual elements are more stylized, focusing on the bird's transformation rather than maintaining all elements from Image A. While there might be some green elements, they are not in focus or as prominent as they were in the original image.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sunlight originating from the upper left, casting a warm golden glow across the scene and creating soft highlights on the bird and blossoms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting still seems to originate from the upper left, casting a warm glow over the scene. The overall illumination maintains a similar warm, golden hue as in Image A, highlighting the bird and blossoms, even though the bird is now in a more imaginative form.",
      "weight": 2,

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the background contain softly blurred pink cherry blossoms and dark tree branches, forming a layered depth effect behind the main subject?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background continues to show softly blurred pink cherry blossoms and dark tree branches, creating a depth effect. This blurred, layered backdrop remains consistent with the setting of Image A, even though the bird occupies a fantastical vision in the foreground.",
