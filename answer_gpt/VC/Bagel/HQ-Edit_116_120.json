        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, within the snow globe, the flag is positioned at the top of the tallest central spire of the sandcastle. The flag is clearly visible, standing atop the main and most prominent spire, which is also centrally placed, suggesting its tallest position relative to the surrounding towers.",
