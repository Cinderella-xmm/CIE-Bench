    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the two-tiered roof structure with a reddish-brown lower section and a dark, rough-textured upper section still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roof is visible, featuring a reddish-brown roof but lacks the two-tiered structure seen in Image A with a dark, rough-textured upper section. Both the shift in design style and appearance imply that there has been a significant alteration in architectural elements, so the original two-tiered concept is not present.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a green door is visible at the front center of the house, similar to the original in Image A. Even though the surrounding elements have changed, the placement retains its centered positioning as per the original description.",

    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the windows have been altered as compared to Image A. The window above the door doesn't appear prominently as an oval shape, and the rectangular window to its left does not retain the same configuration, suggesting a redesign of these elements.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, more stylized trees with lights and different appearances replace the unique rust-colored tree from Image A. This visual change reflects an intentional modification of the landscape style around the house.",
      "weight": 2,

    {

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B shows green landscaping, itâ€™s more manicured grass rather than the scattered green moss-like vegetation found along the steps and the house base in Image A. This conveys a change in how natural elements are incorporated into the landscape.",
