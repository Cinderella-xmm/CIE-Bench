    "Question": "Q1: Is the text 'RONALOO' and the number '7' visible on the player's jersey?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the jersey of the player features a number '7' clearly visible on the back. The player’s jersey typically has his name written above it. However, due to the cartoonish nature of the drawing, the text is stylized in an exaggerated fashion and does not accurately depict common names, therefore not clearly showing 'RONALOO'. The original text on a jersey like in the original Image A would be 'RONALDO', but in this stylized depiction, it’s generalized with a logo instead of a clear name.",
