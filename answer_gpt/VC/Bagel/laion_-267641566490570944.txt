    "Question": "Q1: Is the sunlight originating from the upper-left portion of the sky, casting diagonal rays across the mountain range?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the upper-left section of the sky is noticeably brighter, suggesting the source of the sunlight is from that region. The rays of sunlight observe their diagonal path across the mountainscape, creating distinct shafts of light. World knowledge about how sunlight behaves, especially during sunrise or sunset, reinforces this perception.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are there visible layers of mist or haze separating the mountain ranges at different depths?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of atmospheric layers with varying shades and opacities is evident. This gradation in color and visibility of the mountain ranges indicates the presence of mist or haze, which serves to create a sense of depth and distance typical in mountainous landscapes. World knowledge about atmospheric perspective supports this observation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the tallest, most prominent peak located near the center of the image, rising above surrounding spires?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a distinct mountain peak extends prominently near the center, overshadowing the nearby formations. The positioning and height make it the focal point of the landscape, standing tall amidst the setting. This aligns with the common landscape depiction where central peaks are emphasized.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are there green leafy plants visible in the foreground, especially on the left side of the frame?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays visible vegetation with green leafy plants predominantly on the left foreground. These plants add texture and depth to the scene, which echoes typical mountainous and natural landscapes where vegetation thrives in the foreground.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the sky display a gradient from warm orange-pink near the horizon to cooler blue-gray at the top?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sky's coloration transitions smoothly from a warm, orange-pink hue near the horizon to a cooler blue-gray shade higher up in the sky. This gradient is typical during sunrise or sunset hours, enhancing the atmospheric effect.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there visible rough, dark gray rock surfaces on the mountain sides, especially on the left and right edges of the frame?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain sides, especially toward the left and right extremities of the composition, showcase rugged, dark gray rocky textures. This characteristic is typical in mountainous terrain, contributing to the natural rugged contrast against the softer sky.",
    "answer": "Yes"
