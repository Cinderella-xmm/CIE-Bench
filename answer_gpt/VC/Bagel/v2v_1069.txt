    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the original four blades of the ceiling fan?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, we can clearly see that the ceiling fan within the snow globe has four blades. This matches the number of blades seen in the original Image A, which also depicts a ceiling fan with four blades. The observation of both images ensures the retention of this characteristic.",
    "answer": "yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the central hub structure of the ceiling fan still present in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the central hub of the ceiling fan is distinctly visible inside the snow globe. The shape and design of the hub are consistent with that seen in Image A, where the original fan's central hub is identifiable. This indicates that the central hub structure has been maintained in the edited image.",
    "answer": "yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the edited image preserve the metallic texture and color scheme of the ceiling fan?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the ceiling fan's appearance retains the metallic texture and color scheme, showcasing a silver-like finish that resembles metal. This matches the original image (Image A) where the fan is also silver with a metallic finish. The consistency in color and texture across both images confirms that this aspect has been preserved.",
    "answer": "yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the blades arranged symmetrically around the central hub in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, displays the ceiling fan with the blades symmetrically arranged around the central hub. This is similar to Image A where the fan blades are also evenly spaced out, emphasizing symmetry in both designs.",
    "answer": "yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the connection points between the blades and the central hub visible in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the connection points where the blades attach to the central hub are clearly visible. Similarly, in Image A, the original image also shows these connection points distinctly. The presence of these visible connections in both images indicates that this detail has been preserved in the edited version.",
    "answer": "yes"
