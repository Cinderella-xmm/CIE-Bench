    "Question": "Q1: Are the two orange horn-like protrusions on the top of the robot's head present and unchanged in shape and position?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, we observe two orange horn-like protrusions positioned symmetrically on top of the robot's head, similar in placement to those in Image A. The shape and position of these horns appear consistent between both images, indicating no changes. This can be deduced by studying their alignment with the rest of the head structure which remains unchanged across both images.",
