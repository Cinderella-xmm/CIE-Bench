      "question": "Is the circular logo featuring a navy blue \"C\" shape with a red semicircle at the top present on the front of the energy drink can?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The circular logo described appears on the edited image (Image B) as part of the shoe design, located on the side of the sneaker. The existence of the logo on the shoe suggests strong brand visibility. However, the presence of this logo on an energy drink can requires identification based on its appearance in the context of Image B. Because the image shows a shoe and not a can, the description of its position on a can does not align with its actual placement.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the energy drink can feature the navy blue mesh texture across its main body surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the navy blue mesh texture is evident as part of the upper design of the sneaker. This type of mesh is typical on athletic shoes for ventilation and style. Imagining it transferred onto an energy drink can would imply using shoe-like textures as can graphicsâ€”an uncommon choice. Therefore, such a texture does not appear in the conventional context of an energy drink can, as this description does not appropriately fit what is seen in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the navy blue laces depicted as raised embossed ridges wrapping around the middle section of the can in their original crisscross pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, navy blue laces are shown prominently on the shoe with an embossed appearance, creating a visual effect of depth and interwoven structure. Transferring the conceptual image of laces crisscrossing a can in the same pattern seen on shoes is typically unlikely for cans. The crisscross pattern is iconic of shoe design rather than can branding.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are three navy blue stripes arranged horizontally across the lower portion of the can, matching the original shoe's stripe layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows three navy blue stripes on the lower part of the shoe, suggesting minimalistic branding or style. These stripes, part of the sneaker's design, may symbolize a typical design feature of sports apparel but not suitable for a beverage can. Matching the layout precisely as can graphics would be an unusual choice for product branding where different visual dynamics are typically engaged.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the word \"Kickstart\" displayed in red lettering on the upper portion of the can?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'kickstart' is presented on the sneaker in red near the lacing system, strikingly visible due to the contrast. This placement works well with shoe design principles, where branding is often displayed prominently. For a beverage can, the visual context in Image B does not correspond, as no direct reference or visual link to beverage branding is made.",
