    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the Elizabeth Tower positioned on the right side of the image with a tall, vertical structure topped by a pointed spire and a clock face near the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a structure resembling the Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben) is visible, characterized by its tall, vertical height and clock face. However, it is dominated by surreal, plant-like structures intertwining with it, deviating from the traditional architecture. The spire and clock face are still discernible, confirming it as the Elizabeth Tower. Therefore, despite the alterations, the Elizabeth Tower is on the right side of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the building complex on the left side of the image have multiple pointed Gothic spires and a long horizontal facade with repeating arched windows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building complex on the left features Gothic architectural elements including pointed spires and an elongated facade, aligned with the traditional style of the Palace of Westminster. This matches the expectation of such a historical style, so the complex does reflect those architectural characteristics.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a red double-decker bus labeled with route number 53 traveling across the bridge from left to right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red double-decker buses are rendered in a futuristic style and are not labeled with route numbers. Instead, they are hovering above the ground, suggesting they are not traditional buses. Therefore, no specific route number such as 53 is visible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a bridge with green metal railings and a paved roadway extending across the image from left to right, connecting the buildings to the right side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the traditional bridge with green metal railings typical of Westminster Bridge is not visibly extending across the image. The futuristic and surreal style of the image lacks the presence of traditional roadway elements or railings connecting the two sides.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the text “BUS LANE” clearly visible in white lettering on the road surface near the right edge of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a futuristic scene without standard road markings. The absence of normal road design, with buses floating rather than moving on a road, means that conventional roadway indicators like “BUS LANE” text are not visible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there people visible walking on the sidewalk on the right side of the bridge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are human figures scattered throughout the scene, but without a discernible sidewalk or bridge context typical of a modern street. Hence, while people are present, they are not specifically depicted as walking on a sidewalk on the right side of a bridge.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a second red double-decker bus with route number 43 visible further down the road on the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features multiple futuristic red buses, but they lack any visible traditional numbering or route designation such as 43. The scene doesn't represent conventional roads, further supporting the absence of route labels.",
