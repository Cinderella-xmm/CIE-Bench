      "question": "Is the two-tiered roof with upward-curving eaves and ornamental ridge details preserved in the same structural outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image is in a stained glass style, and it retains the basic structural outline of a two-tiered roof with upward-curving eaves and ornamental ridge details. The visual representation of these elements is simplified and stylized, typical for stained glass art. The roof is depicted with curved outlines in the glass segments, indicating the same kind of architectural details and design cues. This suggests that the structural outline is maintained, albeit in a different visual representation.",

      "question": "Is the large red moon positioned in the upper center of the sky and retaining its dominant red color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moon appears in the upper center of the stained glass design, depicted as a bold red circle, resembling the celestial body seen in Image A. Although it's not a realistic representation, the stained glass art style causes colors to be bold and abstract. Here, the red hue is retained, representing the red moon found in the original image, suggesting that the color and general position are preserved.",

      "question": "Are there two red-colored trees symmetrically placed on the left and right sides of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features red-colored floral designs on both sides of the building, which are red and placed symmetrically. However, these designs resemble flowers more than trees, which differs from the original's tree depiction. Although red and symmetric, the nature of the imagery is different, showing flowers instead of trees. This implies that the symmetry is preserved but the object type isn’t.",

      "question": "Is there a reflective body of water in the foreground mirroring the building and moon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depicted water that shows reflection of the building or moon, as seen in the original image. The style of stained glass does not readily allow for detailed reflective surfaces where such reflections are shown in a realistic manner, and there are no artistic segments indicating reflections or water bodies.",

      "question": "Are there stone steps descending from the building platform toward the pond?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone steps are part of the stained glass design, clearly descending from the building platform. However, there is no pond depicted in the foreground. The steps are styled in stained glass format, showing clear continuity and descending pattern, yet the pond’s presence isn't visually confirmed.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the windows on the building emitting a warm orange light, particularly on the upper and lower levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stained glass depiction does not emit light and serves a different artistic purpose. While the building's glass segments are colored with various pieces, they don't mimic the luminous effect of light emitting from the windows like in the original image where warm orange was shown, therefore no warm orange light emission is visually present.",

      "question": "Are there low green shrubs and manicured plants surrounding the base of the building and pond?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B provides stylized multicolor glass arrangements around the building, these hint at vegetation but not specifically manicured green shrubs at the building base or a pond. The stained glass style captures parts of the scene uniquely, without directly representing green shrubs specifically identifiably.",
