      "question": "Are the cabinet doors and drawers designed in a shaker style in both views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cabinet doors and drawers display a simple and functional design with recessed panels and minimal detailing, which is characteristic of the shaker style. The world knowledge about shaker style suggests it often features a clean, straightforward design. Therefore, the drawing in Image B represents a shaker style. However, without direct comparison to Image A, we don't assess its presence in Image A. Our analysis is based solely on Image B.",

      "question": "Do both the top-down and side views show two rectangular sink basins with consistent dimensions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts singles rectangular sink basins in both top-down and side views. The basins appear to have consistent dimensions, as they maintain the same rectangular shape and proportions. Given that world knowledge recognizes this form as typical for sink designs and the visual information from the drawing supports this, the basins are consistent in size and design in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the black faucets present above each sink basin in both views with the correct orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows one black faucet above each sink basin rather than two, and their orientation seems correct when considering how faucets are typically positioned above sink basins. World knowledge recognizes the common faucet above sink configuration, signifying its correctness based on this placement in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the countertop depicted in both views as a light-colored marble texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the countertop is shown with a plain surface that lacks detailed texture marking of marble. In realistic depictions, marble texture is detailed and distinctive, involving veining patterns not visible in Image B. Based on the lack of visual cues indicating marble in the sketch, the countertop is not depicted with a marble texture.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the compartments (drawers and cabinets) arranged in the same manner in both the top-down and side views, mirroring the original layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top-down view presents a clear arrangement with a central sink and two doors, while the side view also reflects two cabinet doors beneath the sink. Observing visual cues about typical architectural arrangements and consistency, both views show structural harmony but only having singular compartments on each representation, thus not strictly mirroring original multicomponent layout seen in Image A.",
