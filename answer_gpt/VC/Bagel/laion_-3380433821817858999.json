      "question": "Is the character depicted with light blue spiky hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From observing Image B, we see the character has a stylized hair design characterized by sharp edges and points, which is commonly associated with spiky hairstyles in animation. The color appears light blue, fitting within a familiar visual trope for animated characters known for vibrant hair colors. Such designs are typical for characters in the Dragon Ball series, where hairstyles often defy realistic expectations.",

      "question": "Does the character wear a blue bodysuit with a white armored chest plate featuring yellow side panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the character is wearing a skin-tight blue outfit accompanied by a chest piece that is white and styled to resemble armor. The chest piece includes yellow bands or panels along the sides, adding to the typical armor detail seen on characters like Vegeta. This indicates a balance in design between functional armor and aesthetic character design.",

      "question": "Are the gloves and boots white with yellow tips at the fingers and toes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gloves and boots are predominantly white, based on the color and shape of these accessories. They feature yellow tips at the ends of fingers and toes, which aligns with an iconic style of Dragon Ball characters, providing both functional design elements and aesthetic contrast.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the character have an open mouth and intense eyes showing aggression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From Image B, inspecting expressions like an open mouth and intense eyes indicating aggression would typically involve contrasting these elements with the surrounding face design. However, despite the edited face being blurred, characters from action-packed anime often feature aggressive expressions, providing visual cues about their combative nature.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the character shown in a dynamic mid-air pose with arms raised and legs bent backward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pose is clearly dynamic; the character's body orientation suggests mid-air motion. The arms are raised as if bracing or charging, and the legs have a bent appearance indicating a jumping or lunging action typical in combat scenes. This posture is consistent with dynamic action poses seen in animations that emphasize movement and power.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the combination of blue bodysuit, white armor, yellow panels, and light blue spiky hair are quintessential characteristics of the Dragon Ball character Vegeta. While the face is blurred, these elements together make it highly plausible to identify this figure as Vegeta from Dragon Ball.",
