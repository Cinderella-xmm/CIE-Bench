      "question": "Does the apple retain its glossy red skin with visible white specks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apple clearly presents a glossy red skin with multiple white specks across its surface. This is a typical appearance of certain types of apples, such as Gala or Fuji apples, which are characterized by such specks due to their natural wax coating. The sheen suggests freshness and a well-maintained surface, confirming that the apple retains its glossy character.",

      "question": "Is the short dried stem still present on the apple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the apple with a clearly visible short dried stem in all three whole apple views. This is consistent with how apples are typically picked and sometimes sold with the stem intact. The presence of stems is common for freshly picked apples to maintain freshness during transportation.",

      "question": "Is the apple displayed on a wooden surface in all views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a plain white surface, which contrasts the wooden surface visible in Image A. The uniform white backdrop emphasizes the apple and provides a controlled environment likely used for clarity and aesthetics in displaying the apple's features rather than a natural setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the apple in three whole-fruit views and one cross-section. In each view, the apple maintains a realistic, rounded shape typical of apples. This impression is supported by the symmetrical and well-proportioned display, implying a consistent volume and realistic appearance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the cross-section view of Image B, the flesh of the apple is clearly visible, showing a clean cut with uniform texture. The color and grain-like appearance are consistent with that of real apple flesh, indicating a realistic portrayal of the apple's interior.",
