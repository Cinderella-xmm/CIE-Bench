      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffe appears inside a display case and retains its natural pattern of brown patches outlined with cream, which are typical characteristics of a giraffe's coat.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B depict the person and giraffe in close proximity, with the giraffe bending its long neck down to interact with the person. The relative distance and positioning between them appear consistent in both images.",
