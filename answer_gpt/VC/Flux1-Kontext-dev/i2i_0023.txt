    "Question": "Q1: Does the boy's face retain clear and recognizable features such as eyes, nose, and mouth?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the boy’s face appears blurred, making it difficult to identify any distinct facial features such as eyes, nose, and mouth. The blur effect leads the face to lose its clarity and recognition. While assessing Image A, the blur has also obscured facial features, but the focus here is solely based on the clarity seen in Image B.",
