        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration shows the man's head, but the face and glasses are blurred. The outline is similar to the original, suggesting retention of the general face shape and glasses from Image A, even though the blurred area prevents detailed comparison.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pattern on the tie appears to be an abstract version of the original pattern seen in Image A. It mimics the complexity and geometric style observed in the original, indicating an attempt to retain the same pattern.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit jacket's texture is simplified to a more generic pattern without the original checkered detail found in Image A. Therefore, the specific checkered pattern is not retained in the illustration.",
