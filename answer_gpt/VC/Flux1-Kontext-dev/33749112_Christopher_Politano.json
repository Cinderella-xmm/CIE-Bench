    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the three distinct mountain peaks—two broad and one sharp—present and positioned in the same relative layout as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain peaks appear to be altered compared to Image A. The original image shows mountain peaks more closely resembling natural formations, while in Image B, they have been replaced or heavily edited to fit a fantastical theme, as evident in the background of the giant figure occupying the foreground. This indicates a different relative layout.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the lake located in the same basin with the same irregular shape, including the curved western edge and shallow extension toward the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the presence of a fantastical figure altering the foreground area, the lake's shape and position within the basin remain consistent with the original image, maintaining its irregular shape with a curved edge and shallow extension.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the trails maintain their original routing pattern across the slopes, including their connection to the lake and convergence points?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trails across the slopes appear to maintain the same routing pattern as seen in Image A, connecting the lake and converging at similar points. The presence of trails is visible around the figure, suggesting continuity.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible human figures present near the shoreline of the lake, consistent with their placement in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the human figures along the shoreline in Image A are no longer visible due to the large fantasy figure partially covering the area where the figures appeared originally.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the rocky outcrops and boulders visible along the shoreline and slopes, maintaining their original distribution and size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, elements such as rocky outcrops and boulders appear altered or obscured by the large fantastical figure, disrupting the original natural distribution and size seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the green vegetation cover present across the slopes, maintaining its general distribution and density as seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vegetation cover across the slopes generally retains its distribution and density, even with the addition of the large figure, preserving the natural look as seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the sky clear blue with scattered wispy clouds, matching the original atmospheric conditions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky remains clear and blue with scattered wispy clouds, matching the atmospheric conditions of Image A, suggesting no significant alteration to the background sky.",
