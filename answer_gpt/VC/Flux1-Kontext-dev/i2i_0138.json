      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blades of the scissors are represented through a sketch drawing, which lacks the shine and reflective quality typical of metal surfaces seen in real life. When objects are sketched, the intricate details required for reflective surfaces are often simplified or omitted and usually rendered in textures or shading that indicate shape but not reflectiveness. Therefore, the blades in Image B do not appear visibly reflective as they are in Image A.",

      "question": "Do the golden handles still show a polished finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a sketch with textural shading applied to the handles of the scissors, which gives them a matte finish rather than a polished metallic one. Sketch drawings typically do not capture the shine and texture that signify polished surfaces due to the inherent limitations of line and shading in pencil drawings. Thus, they lose the polished finish evident in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the open V-shape configuration of the blades preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B keeps the scissors in an open position, forming an identifiable V-shape, similar to Image A. Despite the conversion to a sketch style, the spatial arrangement of the blades stays consistent, preserving the recognizable opened scissor configuration. Sketches maintain shape and structural details even when changing texture or color attributes.",

      "question": "Is the background still a uniform dark gray?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background of the scissors has changed from the uniform dark gray of Image A to a lighter, paper-like texture typical in sketches. The background color often simplifies to provide contrast in artistic drawings, highlighting the sketched object more sharply against a lighter backdrop.",

      "question": "Are the edges of the blades still clean and sharp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the sketch of Image B, the edges of the blades are defined by clear, precise lines and shaded regions that maintain their sharp appearance, a common trait in stylized representations where clarity of shape is important. Sketch techniques often emphasize outlines and contouring to simulate sharpness even in the absence of true razor-edged detail perceived in real-world photographs like Image A.",
