        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a turquoise-colored dome is visible with a ribbed texture and a golden finial at the top. The coloring and design details, such as the ribbing and finial, match traditional architectural elements commonly associated with historical Islamic architecture. Therefore, based on these visual cues combined with architectural knowledge, the dome is present.",

      "question": "Are the blue mosaic tiles with floral and geometric patterns covering the iwanâ€™s facade present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, showcases a facade richly decorated with blue mosaic tiles that display intricate floral and geometric patterns. These design elements are characteristic of Islamic architecture and align with what would be expected on an iwan. Visual inspection confirms their presence.",

      "question": "Is the tall cylindrical minaret with a patterned band near the top visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a tall cylindrical structure next to the dome that resembles a minaret, featuring a decoration or pattern around its top section. This is indicative of traditional Islamic architectural styles, where minarets are often taller structures with such decorative elements. Thus, through visual cue analysis, the minaret is present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection, Image B does not show prominent golden highlights along the edges of the arches or dome. The tiles are mainly blue with golden patterns on the outer object's surface but not specifically highlighting the dome and arches. Thus, based on visual evidence, no significant golden highlights are observed along those architectural features.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure is designed with a beige-colored surface covering its lower part, which simulates brick-like construction. This ties into authentic architectural designs where the lower structures are often brick-based. Visual cues confirm its presence.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement shows the dome roughly centralized in relation to the iwan, with the minaret positioned to the left side of the main structure. The positioning aligns with typical architectural layouts found in historical complexes, corroborating its presence.",
