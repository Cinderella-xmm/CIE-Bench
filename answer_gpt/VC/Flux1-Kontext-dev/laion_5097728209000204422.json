      "question": "Are the rectangular-framed glasses present on the subject's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is holding a sword, wearing historical attire, and does not have glasses. In contrast, Image A features a casually dressed person. The absence of glasses in Image B combined with the historical theme suggests that glasses were excluded in the editing process.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is depicted with styled, wavy hair typical of historical paintings, where the hair appears well-kept and integrated into the artistic style. The graying detail isn't as prominent as in normal images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurred face does not allow for a direct comparison of facial features, but given the significant artistic and stylistic difference in Image B, it is likely that the facial structure does not precisely match due to the stylized nature of historical painting.",
