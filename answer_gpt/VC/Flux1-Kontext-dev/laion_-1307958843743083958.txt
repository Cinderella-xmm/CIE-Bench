    "Question": "Q1: Are the cheetahs in a seated position with bent hind legs, tucked tails, and upright front paws?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are indeed cheetahs in a seated position. The hind legs appear bent, and the front paws are upright as the cheetahs sit. Their posture is typical for seated animal figures, where the body weight is supported primarily by the hind legs, and the front legs are positioned straight or slightly bent.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Is the head of each cheetah turned slightly to the side, away from the central divider?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, each cheetah's head is turned slightly to the side, facing away from the central divider. This positioning suggests an intentional design choice to show the profile of the cheetahs, emphasizing their form.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does each cheetah rest on a two-tiered base with a black upper section and a bronze-colored stepped lower section?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the base of each cheetah figure appears to have a two-tiered design. The upper section of the base is black while the lower section seems to be in a complementary, metallic bronze-color with a stepped design, indicating different tiers or layers.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the cheetah figures positioned symmetrically, one on the left and one on the right, equidistant from the center?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetah figures are positioned symmetrically, with one located on the left and the other on the right side of the central divider. This symmetry is visually balanced as both figures appear to be at equal distance from the divider, contributing to a harmonious overall appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there exactly three vertical panels positioned between the cheetahs, with two narrower ones flanking a wider central one?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the space between the cheetah figures is occupied by a single vertical translucent structure rather than distinct panels. There are no multiple vertical panels visible, thus not aligning with the description of three panels with varying widths.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the tail of each cheetah curve upward and rest on the base behind the body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tails of the cheetahs appear to lie flat along the base instead of curving upward. This detail can be crucial for depicting the posture of an animal figure and in this case, the tail placement indicates a more grounded design choice.",
    "answer": "No"
