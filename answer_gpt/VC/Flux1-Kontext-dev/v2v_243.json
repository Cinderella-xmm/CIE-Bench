      "correct_answer": "** Yes",

        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "While the new footwear in Image B shares the same vibrant design as the original skis, it does not retain a similar shape or silhouette. The skis are long and flat, suitable for skiing, whereas the footwear follows a boot shape, designed for wearing on feet. Therefore, the shape or silhouette is not retained.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
