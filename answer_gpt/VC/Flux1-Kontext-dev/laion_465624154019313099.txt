    "Question": "Q1: Is the grid of yellow rounded domes covering the surface of the cake present?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the depiction involves cartoon-style graphics instead of a realistic photo of the cake. The image uses characters instead of an actual cake, hence there is no grid of yellow rounded domes covering the surface in this image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there small red dots on top of each yellow dome?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, since it is a cartoon image with a character, it does not depict any yellow domes with small red dots on top. The cartoon theme does not include these specific details.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the cross-section showing a golden sponge base, white cream layer, and deep red jam layer visible?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not include a realistic cross-section of a cake as it features a cartoon character associated with cake. It does not show any layers like a golden sponge base, white cream layer, or deep red jam layer.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are two strawberries with green leaves positioned at the top center of the cake?",

}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are chopped nuts visible around the base of the cake?",

}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the cake maintain a square shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, rather than depicting a square-shaped cake, it shows a character-based illustration that does not maintain a cakeâ€™s geometric shape.",

}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the cake placed on a silver-toned plate with an embossed floral pattern?",

}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Is the deep red jam layer clearly visible between the white cream and golden sponge?",

    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q9: Is the white cream layer visible between the sponge and jam layers?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, no realistic depiction such as layers of cream between sponge and jam is present because it is a cartoon illustration.",

}

{
    "Question": "Q10: Is the golden sponge base layer visible in the cross-section?",
    "explanation": "Image B, focusing on cartoon-style graphics, lacks a realistic cake cross-section and therefore does not show any golden sponge base layer.",
