      "question": "Is the cat's fur entirely black?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cue in Image B shows a cat with entirely black fur. By analyzing the image closely, the fur appears completely black across its body, a common characteristic for black cats. Hence, the conclusion can be made that the catâ€™s fur is indeed entirely black.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the cat still wearing the formal tie around its neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a cat with a formal tie around its neck, clearly visible in the image. The visual aspect and placement of the tie suggest that the cat is indeed wearing it, as it appears snugly around the neck. This indicates the presence of a tie, typically representing formal attire for humorous effect.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the cat still have bright yellow eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is shown with bright yellow eyes, standing out distinctly, as they are a prominent feature in the image, thus matching the characteristic eye color often portrayed for animated or cartoon-style images. This suggests that the cat retains the bright yellow eyes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the cat placed on a beige carpet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict the cat on a carpet, but rather on a plain beige-colored background, typical of a studio or controlled environment setup rather than an actual carpet. The absence of texture normally associated with carpets means it is not placed on a carpet.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a bookshelf visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B does not contain any bookshelf; rather, it presents a plain beige backdrop, suggesting a simplified setting. Thus, based on the image's content, a bookshelf is not featured or visible in the background.",
