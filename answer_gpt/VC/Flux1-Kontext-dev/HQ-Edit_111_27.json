      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geisha's hair is arranged in an intricate updo adorned with several golden hairpins and floral ornaments. There are also visible dangling tassels.

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the geisha have a white-painted face with red lips and darkened eye makeup?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face of the geisha in Image B is blurred, making it impossible to discern specific facial features such as makeup. Therefore, no analysis can be provided on the face paint or makeup details.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The geisha in Image B is holding a fan with her right hand. This can be inferred by observing the relative positioning of the hand holding the fan in relation to the body, assuming the viewer's perspective. The arm holding the fan extends from the side of the image that is typically considered the right side of a person.",

      "question": "Are the cherry blossoms arranged in an arching pattern above and below the geisha?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossoms are depicted as part of a tree with branches and blossoms extending around the geisha. However, they do not form a complete arch both above and below her. Instead, they are more prominently organized above and to the side, which is consistent with stylized depictions of cherry blossom branches.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a significant red bow tied at the back of the kimono, which is visually prominent. This is a characteristic feature often found in traditional Japanese kimonos, where bows and obis are used as decorative elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geisha is depicted in a profile-like view with her body facing slightly to the left, from the viewer's perspective, as she holds the fan. Her head is not tilted downward; rather, it is held upright. Therefore, her posture does not match the description of being turned downward or facing to the right.",
