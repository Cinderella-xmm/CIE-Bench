      "question": "Are the brown and white mesh patterns visible on the giraffes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffes have a simplified brown pattern with lighter spots resembling a cartoon or illustrative style. These patterns mimic the mesh-like appearance of giraffe coats but in a more stylized and uniform manner, typical in animated or cartoon depictions. This indicates that the characteristic mesh pattern of giraffes is indeed represented.",

      "question": "Are the ossicones present on the giraffes' heads?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each giraffe is depicted with two distinct protrusions on top of their heads, simplified to accommodate the cartoon style. These protrusions are ossicones, which are characteristic features of giraffes. Even in simplified artistic renditions, these features are often maintained because they are a recognizable part of a giraffeâ€™s anatomy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the giraffes positioned naturally relative to the grassy field and trees in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite its cartoonish style, the giraffes are standing upright on the grassy field, aligning with how giraffes are typically depicted in their natural habitat. The background of trees and rocks suggests a natural setting similar to a savannah or a zoo, which is consistent with where giraffes are usually found. The positioning respects naturalistic proportion and spacing relative to the background.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background composed of grass, trees, and rocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background clearly includes elements such as green grass, leafy trees, and large rocks. These components are visually identifiable even in a stylized illustration and are typical features of a natural habitat where giraffes might live, providing a simplified yet recognizable landscape.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the general body structure of the giraffes, including their legs and torso, remain intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffes maintain a recognizable body structure with long necks, torsos, and legs, characteristics fundamental to giraffe anatomy. Despite the cartoonish representation, their proportions and body parts are consistent with the giraffe's natural form, indicating that the structural integrity of their bodies is preserved.",
