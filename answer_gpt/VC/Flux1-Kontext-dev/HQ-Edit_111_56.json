      "question": "Are both feet positioned en pointe, with the right foot slightly ahead of the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows both feet positioned en pointe, which is typical for ballet poses. The right foot is slightly ahead of the left foot, as indicated by the placement of the feet on the platform. This conclusion is derived by observing the stance and alignment commonly used in ballet to create a pleasing aesthetic line.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both arms extended laterally from the body, with palms facing inward and fingers gently curved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arms of the statue-like figure are extended outward from the shoulders, positioned laterally. The fingers are indeed gently curved, and the palms appear to face inward, aligning with a standard ballet pose known as second position.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the head turned to the left, with the chin slightly raised?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head is facing forward rather than being turned to the left, and there's no noticeable tilt or raise of the chin. The positioning is more neutral, typical of a classical statue portrayal.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the legs fully extended and aligned vertically, with the spine slightly arched backward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the legs fully extended and seemingly aligned vertically. However, the spine does not appear to be arched backward but rather maintains a straight, vertical alignment. This is a standard posture for a standing ballet position to maintain balance and elegance.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the arms positioned at approximately hip level, extending outward from the sides of the torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arms are elevated above hip level, extending outward and upward from the sides of the torso. This arm positioning is common in ballet for creating a particular visual aesthetic.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the upper body slightly tilted forward while maintaining vertical alignment through the spine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the upper body is not tilted forward; instead, it maintains a vertical alignment. This posture is characteristic of a classical ballet stance, where balance and poise are achieved through a straight alignment.",
