      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The choker necklace in Image B is clearly multi-layered and positioned around the mannequin's neck, as in Image A.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the right hand does not have a ring visible on the index finger, or any other finger. This absence points to a deviation from the original portrayal in Image A, where a ring might have been present. This observation draws from the detailed inspection of the hand in Image B.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the saree with a visible wide, patterned border along the pallu and hem. The attention to this detail reflects typical design features of sarees where borders play a crucial aesthetic role. The patterns appear as carved rather than embroidered but maintain alignment and width as observed in Image A, demonstrating preservation of design in Image B.",
