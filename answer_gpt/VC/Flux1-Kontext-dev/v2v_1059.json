      "question": "Are the zebras' bodies covered in distinct black and white stripes that follow the natural pattern seen in the original image, including variations in thickness and alignment across the torso, legs, and face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras' bodies show distinct black and white stripes that appear to follow a realistic pattern, similar to what you would expect in a natural setting. The stripes display variations in thickness and alignment across different body parts, including the torso, legs, and face. Zebras are known for their unique stripe patterns, which are as distinctive as fingerprints in humans. Based on this understanding, it can be deduced that Image B preserves these features.",

      "question": "Is each zebra depicted with its head lowered toward the ground in a natural grazing pose, with legs positioned to support this stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows all zebras with their heads lowered towards the ground, indicating a grazing stance. This posture is typical for zebras when feeding, where they lower their necks to reach the grass while keeping their legs slightly apart to support their body weight. The stance helps maintain balance and facilitates feeding. Based on the positioning of their bodies, Image B accurately depicts a natural grazing pose.",

      "question": "Is the horizontal wire fence with evenly spaced wooden posts clearly visible across the mid-ground of the image, separating the field from the treeline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible horizontal wire fence spanning the image's mid-ground, with evenly spaced wooden posts visible. Fences often serve to separate different areas, and in this image, the fence acts as a boundary between the grassy field and the background trees. The image provides a clear view of this structure, indicating that the fence is a distinct feature in the image.",

      "question": "Is the ground covered in green grass with visible patches of bare soil and small green shrubs scattered throughout the field?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ground in Image B is predominantly covered with green grass, typical for a field setting. There are small patches of bare soil visible in the image, along with several small green shrubs scattered across the field. This combination of grass, soil, and shrubs creates a realistic depiction of a natural landscape, consistent with what one might expect in a pastoral or semi-wild environment.",

      "question": "Is there a continuous line of green trees and bushes behind the fence, with a clear light blue sky above the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, behind the visible fence, there is a line of green trees and bushes running along the horizon. The sky above these trees is a uniform light blue, which is typical of clear weather conditions. This description of the background is consistent with natural landscapes where a line of trees forms a barrier with the sky stretching above it.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the zebras have short, upright manes composed of alternating black and white stripes, consistent with their body patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the zebras with short, upright manes that are composed of alternating black and white stripes. This is consistent with the natural appearance of a zebra's mane, which mirrors the stripe pattern found on their bodies. The mane's structure is a characteristic feature in zebras and contributes to their distinctive look. Image B maintains this visual consistency.",

      "question": "Are the zebraâ€™s hooves dark in color and positioned on the ground in a way that supports their grazing posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras' hooves are dark in color and are firmly positioned on the ground, supporting their bodies as they graze. Zebras typically have dark hooves, which provide stability and traction; this is necessary for the stance adopted while grazing. The image shows this aspect clearly, indicating a realistic positioning of the zebras.",
