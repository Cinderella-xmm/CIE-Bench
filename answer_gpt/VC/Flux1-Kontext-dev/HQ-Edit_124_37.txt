    "Question": "Q1: Is the subject's skin tone still dark brown?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's skin tone appears to be a warm and medium shade, which does not reflect the darker brown tone seen in traditional interpretations or depictions. This conclusion is derived from visually assessing the visible skin areas (arms and feet) of the subject.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the subjectâ€™s head tilted upward with her gaze directed toward the sky?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's head is positioned straight forward, giving the impression of facing directly outward rather than upward. There is no visible clue indicating an upward tilt or a gaze toward the sky, which would usually be characterized by a raised chin and upward-directed eyes.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are both arms extended outward with hands open and palms facing forward?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the arms are extended outward but the hands are grasping the edges of the garment, and the palms are turned inward rather than facing forward. This observation is based on the open palm orientation typically seen in an outward-facing gesture, which is not present in this posture.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the subject have braided hair, even if stylized?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject appears to have long flowing hair, which does not display the characteristics of braided hair seen in various braided styles. Braiding typically involves intertwining strands of hair to create a cohesive pattern or design, which is not visible here.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the lower portion of the garment flaring outward, suggesting motion?",
    "explanation": "The lower part of the garment in Image B appears static and calmly flows downward without pronounced outward flaring or movement indication. The lack of dynamically positioned fabric or visibly exaggerated curves suggests that the garment isn't actively flaring outward.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the subject smiling with visible teeth?",
    "explanation": "Since the face is blurred, it's not possible to determine the specific expression or make observations about the visibility of teeth. Any conclusion regarding whether the subject is smiling is speculative without the display of facial features.",
    "answer": "No"
