      "question": "Are the floral and foliate engraved patterns visible on the body of the transformed owl, arranged symmetrically between vertical ribs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body of the mechanical owl in Image B features decorative patterns that are consistent with floral and foliate designs, emphasizing elegance and symmetry. These decorations are arranged between the ribs, which is similar to traditional craftsmanship where symmetry is a key aesthetic element. This observation, based on the visual details of the owl's body, suggests that the patterns are indeed arranged in a symmetrical manner between vertical ribs.",

      "question": "Does the transformed owl retain a shiny, polished metallic surface consistent with the original teapot’s finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mechanical owl in Image B has a gleaming, shiny surface that reflects light, indicating a polished metallic finish. This is consistent with the appearance of the original teapot in Image A, which also showcases a similar reflective and polished metallic surface. Both images depict surfaces that emphasize shine and polish, characteristic of well-maintained metallic objects.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the beak of the mechanical owl shaped like the original teapot’s curved spout, extending forward and slightly upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The beak of the owl in Image B appears to resemble a small decorative element rather than a curved spout extending forward and upward. In contrast, Image A shows the original teapot with a distinct spout that curves outward. The transformation of this element into a short beak in Image B distinctly moves away from replicating the original spout’s shape and function.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the tail of the mechanical owl follow the same graceful C-shaped curve as the original teapot’s handle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tail of the mechanical owl is not visible as a separate entity due to the structure of the object and its position. However, the handle of a teapot would typically curve, while in Image B, this part of the owl has been altered where the handle appears more like wings and not following the C-shaped trajectory as seen with an actual 'tail'. Therefore, the C-shaped curve of the original handle does not directly translate to a similar tail form in the owl's design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the crown-like head of the mechanical owl include a pointed, tiered finial matching the original teapot’s lid top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The head of the mechanical owl in Image B features a design that mimics a crown, including a pointed, tiered finial at its top. This design is consistent with the finial seen on the lid of the original teapot in Image A. Both images showcase decorative and elaborate tops that are tiered and pointed, making them visually similar.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the body segments of the mechanical owl divided into vertical ribs, each housing a decorative motif, mirroring the original teapot’s structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the mechanical owl is structured in a way that features vertical ribs, and each segment houses a decorative motif, much like the design observed in the original teapot of Image A. This division of the surface into ribbed segments with detailed motifs provides a visual continuity between the original and transformed objects, highlighting their shared ornate design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the ornamental scrollwork present at the base of the mechanical owl’s tail, corresponding to the original handle’s end?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mechanical owl in Image B does not visibly showcase an isolated ornamental scrollwork at what would be considered the base of a tail. The end of the original teapot's handle in Image A features detailed scrollwork, but in the transformation, this area is not clearly defined as a tail, and the scrollwork is not distinctly observable at a specific tail base.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the tail of the mechanical owl rendered in a dark brown tone consistent with the original handle’s color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the handle of the mechanical owl, which can be interpreted as part of its design motif, maintains a dark tone that is consistent with the original handle’s coloration in Image A. However, since the 'tail' terminology is somewhat metaphorical given the object's dual nature as both teapot and owl, the consistent coloration can be associated with its handle region.",
