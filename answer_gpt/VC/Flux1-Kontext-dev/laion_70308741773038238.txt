    "Question": "Q1: Is the winged 'B' logo visible on the rear of the vehicle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the vehicle appears to be a hybrid design resembling both a car and a boat. It is displayed with a streamlined, yacht-like form. There is no traditional 'rear' as seen in conventional cars, but on the side of the vessel, a winged 'B' logo, which is commonly associated with Bentley, is visible. Due to the boat-like appearance, the rear section lacks a typical car layout where the logo might be expected. Therefore, for the question about the rear specifically, the answer is No.",
