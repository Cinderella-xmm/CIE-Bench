    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there two separate, cushioned backrest sections positioned side by side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show two distinct backrest sections that are fluffy and separate, resembling two clouds. Each section has a pair of eyes, further emphasizing their separation as individual entities. Using common sense, this arrangement clearly indicates two separate backrest sections positioned side by side.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there two armrests, one on each side of the sofa, aligned with the seat cushions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visual indicators resembling armrests on each side of the cloud-like sofa. They appear in alignment with the seat cushions, maintaining the typical arrangement expected for a sofa design. Based on these observations, it can be concluded that the seating arrangement includes two aligned armrests, one on each end.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sofa have four legs, one at each corner of the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a whimsical cloud sofa floating in the air, surrounded by a sky and clouds. With no legs visible, the design challenges conventional sofa design logic, which typically involves legs for support. Based on this reasoning, the sofa shown does not have any visible legs in the image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sofa symmetrically arranged along a vertical centerline, with identical features on the left and right sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a cloud-like sofa with symmetry apparent in its design. Each side mirrors the other in terms of the positions and shapes of the cushions, with identical eye features present. This visual symmetry and balance observed in the design confirm the symmetrical arrangement along a vertical centerline.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the seat cushions positioned directly beneath the backrest cushions, forming a continuous seating surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cloud sofa design demonstrates seat cushions immediately below the backrest cushions, similarly shaped and connected. This arrangement creates a seamless and continuous seating surface, as the fluffy sections flow into one another horizontally, consistent with traditional sofa design principles.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there small black circular fasteners visible on the wooden frame, particularly near the armrest joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the whimsical nature of the cloud sofa features no visible wooden frame or fasteners. The design omits structural elements like a frame or fasteners by leveraging a playful, floating cloud appearance, diverging from conventional construction methods typically requiring such components.",
