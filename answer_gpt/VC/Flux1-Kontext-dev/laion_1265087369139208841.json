      "question": "Are the two cylindrical corner towers still present at the left and right ends of the castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two cylindrical corner towers are present at both ends of the castle, as indicated by the shape and structure of the outermost sections of the facade. The towers maintain the same architectural style as commonly seen in historical castles. By observing the shape and position of the towers in Image B, and considering the similar positioning evident in Image A, it can be inferred they continue to exist in the edited image.",

      "question": "Do the two central square turrets with pointed finials remain atop the central section of the castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two central square turrets atop the castle's center are visible, along with the pointed finials that rise above the square structure. This is consistent with the depiction of castle architecture, where such turrets are often designed for tactical and aesthetic purposes. This compares directly to Image A, where similar turrets with pointed tops can be seen, allowing me to conclude that the turrets are still present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The large central arched entranceway remains present in Image B and is centrally aligned with the pathway leading toward it. The alignment and prominent architectural design are consistent with castle entrances, which often serve as focal points. Image A also depicts a similar central arch entrance, which aligns with the pathway, allowing me to confirm it's present in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the arched windows and openings arranged symmetrically across the front facade of the castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of arched windows and openings across the frontal facade of the castle appears to be symmetrical, characterized by evenly spaced openings that mirror one another across the central axis. This symmetry is a common architectural principle in historical structures. This mirrors the symmetry seen in Image A, where openings follow a balanced pattern, thus confirming their arrangement in Image B remains symmetric.",

      "question": "Is the castle still constructed from dark gray and reddish-brown stone blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the castle constructed from dark gray and reddish-brown stone blocks, indicating a historic and textured appearance suitable for castles. The coloration is consistent with Image A, which showcases the same hues, meaning Image B retains the original construction material evident from the visual cues in both images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the upper portion of the castle still open to the sky, revealing the lack of a roof and internal framework?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B depicts the castle within a snow globe, examination of the architectural design shows the upper portion remains open to the sky, highlighting the absence of a roof and internal framework. This detail aligns with how historic ruins often appear. Comparing with Image A, where openness is visible, leads to the conclusion that Image B maintains this characteristic despite being encased in a snow globe.",

      "question": "Does the central arched entranceway align directly with the center of the gravel pathway leading toward it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central arched entranceway aligns directly with the center of the gravel pathway leading toward it. This spatial alignment reflects traditional design practices where paths are made to lead visitors centrally to a key entrance. Image A also features similar alignment, suggesting that despite the edited context, Image B preserves this centered pathway alignment.",
