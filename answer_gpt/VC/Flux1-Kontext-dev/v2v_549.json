      "question": "Does the Funko Pop-style figure wear the same uniform and helmet as the original player?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Funko Pop-style figure is wearing a baseball uniform with similar color schemes (white with blue accents) to the player's uniform depicted in the original Image A. In the original image, the player on the right also wears a helmet consistent with the Funko Pop figure. This suggests that the figure is designed to resemble the original player, both in uniform and helmet style. The similarity in colors and design indicates they match.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Funko Pop-style figure is visibly holding a baseball bat in its right hand. The bat is designed in a similar way to a typical baseball bat, aligning with the toy's baseball theme. This is evident from the posture and the object in its hand, which appears to be a bat.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the Funko Pop-style figure maintain a similar posture to the original player while holding the bat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Funko Pop-style figure is standing with legs apart and one hand holding a bat, suggesting a stance related to baseball. While the posture may not entirely replicate the player's dynamic pose at bat, it does imitate a typical baseball batting stance with the bat held in a position over the shoulder. Despite differences due to the toy's static nature, the posture is recognizably akin to baseball readiness identified in the original player depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear depiction of baseballs within the packaging next to the Funko Pop-style figure. These baseballs are consistent with the theme and are positioned prominently as part of the box's design. This suggests the context of baseball parts within the toy's concept.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no elements present that indicate the catcher's protective gear being part of the Funko Pop-style figure or its packaging. The scene is focused on the player figure and baseball components, with no representation of the catcher's gear, unlike the original image where a catcher is present.",
