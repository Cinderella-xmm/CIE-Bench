      "question": "Is the sunset visible on the horizon with its reflection on the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky has warm hues that are commonly associated with sunset scenes. The sun is clearly visible on the horizon. The bright circle indicating the setting sun is present, and it casts a clear reflection on the water surface, which mirrors the light from the sun. Combining visual cues with common knowledge about how light from sunset is reflected on water, the sunset is definitively visible on the horizon.",

      "question": "Does the sandy beach retain its texture and extend across the bottom of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area at the bottom of the image appears sandy and shows the texture typically seen on beaches. The sandy area is continuous and stretches horizontally across the lower part of the image. Using knowledge of beach scenes and sand texture appearance, it can be concluded that the sandy beach texture extends across the bottom of the image.",

      "question": "Are the ocean waves present, showing natural movement near the shore?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the ocean waves near the shore, clearly identifiable by the white and foamy texture typical of waves that are breaking. This appearance, combined with common knowledge of ocean scenes, indicates natural wave movement in aquatic environments near the shore. Therefore, ocean waves are present, demonstrating movement characteristic of water near beaches.",

      "question": "Do the surfboards retain their original colors (yellow on the left, red and teal on the right) and upright positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two surfboards held by pandas, one on the left with a yellow color and one on the right with a red and teal color. The surfboards are standing upright beside the pandas. This matches the color and positioning of the surfboards in a detailed comparison with Image A, demonstrating consistency in the arrangement and visual characteristics across the images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the pandas positioned similarly to the original humans, with one arm holding the surfboard and both facing the sunset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pandas are facing the sunset, each holding a surfboard with one arm, which mirrors the positioning of the humans in Image A. The stance, holding of the surfboards, and direction facing the sun is consistent with the original arrangement of the humans. Common knowledge and recognition of posture patterns confirm that the pandas are similarly positioned to the humans from Image A.",
