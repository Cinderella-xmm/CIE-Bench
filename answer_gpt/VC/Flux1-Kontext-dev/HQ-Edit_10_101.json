      "question": "Is the subject’s hair silver and the beard white, as seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hair is visibly silver, which is consistent with the appearance of aging or artificially colored hair. The beard appears to be white, indicating a possible blend of gray or white hair that typically signifies aging or fashion choice. This description is consistent with the original image, where the beard and hair color match.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the subject’s glasses round with thin wire rims, positioned on the nose and ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no glasses are visible on the subject. Evaluating the absence of this accessory with world knowledge, people typically wear visible glasses, making a notable figure on their face, especially on the nose and ears area. Given the absence of glasses in Image B and their presence in Image A, the conclusion aligns with the visual input.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the subject wearing a dark teal turtleneck sweater underneath the cardigan?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a dark teal turtleneck underneath the brown cable-knit cardigan. The visible high neckline suggests the sweater type and matches the original image, confirming consistency across both images.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the cardigan have a high, folded collar and two visible buttons in a vertical line?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardigan is depicted with a high, folded collar, characteristic of cable-knit styles providing warmth. The image shows only one visible button, not two in a vertical line, deviating from expectations based on typical cable-knit cardigans.",

      "question": "Is the wallpaper patterned with floral and vine motifs in pink and cream on a teal background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a wallpaper with floral and vine motifs, however, the background is not teal; instead, the main floral impressions are visible in the framed area and the surrounding frame does not match this description. Instead, it matches pink and cream floral on a secondary layer outside the framed portrait. This contrast is evident in comparison with the patterned teal seen in the original setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts two framed paintings on either side of the subject, featuring floral scenes which are symmetrically hung. This follows the visual cue from Image A as well, maintaining consistency in interior design choices.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the subject seated and turned slightly to the right, with a soft smile and upward gaze?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The posture of the subject in Image B indicates they are seated and turned slightly to the right. However, there is no detectable facial expression like a smile or upward gaze due to the blurred face, which prevents any detailed analysis of expression. Based on the physical cues seen, excluding facial assessment, this analysis doesn't support the claim.",
