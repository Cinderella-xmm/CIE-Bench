        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image depicts a different setting altogether, and instead of individuals, it shows furniture and decor in a room. It lacks any characters, facial features, hairstyles, or body types. By comparison, Image A contains characters with distinguishable facial features, hairstyles, and attire. Thus, these personal characteristics are not present in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the man in the suit still gesturing with his hands in the same manner as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no individuals present at all, including the man in the suit from Image A who is gesturing with his hands. The edited image focuses on a living space with furniture and decor, excluding any human characters entirely.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the relative positions of the characters (e.g., who is standing next to whom) retained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows no characters or their relative positions as it features a living room setting without any people. Image A displays the characters, but Image B is an entirely different setting. Hence, the relative positions of the characters from Image A are not retained in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the individuals still wearing the same type of clothing (e.g., jerseys, suit) as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no individuals present, and therefore, there are no clothing items such as jerseys or suits like in Image A. The setting focuses on furniture and decor rather than human clothing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a clear focal point in the new setting that replaces the jersey's position in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the living room setting contains several elements, including a painting, furniture, and decorative objects. The painting above the console serves as a focal point in the room, drawing attention much like the jersey did in Image A. The emphasis on wall decor suggests it is a considered focus point in the absence of the jersey.",
