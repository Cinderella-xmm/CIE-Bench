      "question": "Is the mouth wide open in a roaring expression with visible teeth and tongue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine if the mouth is wide open with visible teeth and tongue, I need to analyze the expression and mouth area of each figure in Image B. The image portrays three different eras of strength with each figure having their faces blurred. However, these figures are not shown with any distinct features of the mouth being widely open. Thus, it can be concluded that the mouth does not display a roaring expression with visible teeth and tongue.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the eyes narrowed and focused, indicating anger or exertion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The assessment requires a look at the eye characteristics suggestive of facial expressions like anger or exertion. In Image B, the faces of the characters are blurred, making it impossible to discern expressions related to narrowed eyes or focused gazes indicating anger or exertion.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the head have a balding crown with hair along the sides and back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To evaluate the hairstyle, we observe the top and other parts of the head of each figure in Image B. The ancient figure presents with a hair similar to military buzz, the armored figure has a helmet covering hair, and the modern figure exhibits a full head of hair. There is no indication of a balding crown with residual hair along the sides and back.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the jawline strong and angular, with a defined chin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A strong, angular jawline involves distinct facial contours around the lower face. All three figures seem to have muscular and defined physiques, which often extend to facial structure. However, the blurred facial region prevents assessment of their jawlines, precluding conclusions on strong jawlines or defined chins.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the head located at the top center of the figure, aligned with the spine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Head positioning evaluation requires checking its placement on the body. In Image B, each figure's head is situated at the top center of their bodies, correlating with expected human anatomy where the head aligns with the spine.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Is the face clean-shaven, without a beard or mustache?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The condition requires reviewing facial hair presence. As Image B has faces purposely blurred, it obstructs observational knowledge regarding facial hair, not permitting insights if figures are clean-shaven.",
