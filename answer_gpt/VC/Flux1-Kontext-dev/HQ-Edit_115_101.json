    {

      "question": "Is the radial floral and scrollwork pattern with symmetrical swirls and leaf-like motifs present around the central area of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a bottle with an ornate label design. This label does have a pattern, but it is primarily built around the central text described as 'TIMELESS RESERVE.' The design elements surrounding the text may give a decorative effect reminiscent of floral or scrollwork patterns. However, the specific floral and scrollwork pattern with symmetrical swirls and leaf-like motifs, typical of detailed ornamental designs, does not appear around the central area of the object.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the Roman numerals I through XII arranged in a circular sequence around the central label or design element?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the label on the bottle features decorative and perhaps Roman numeral-like elements around 'TIMELESS RESERVE.' However, the presence of Roman numerals I through XII in a perfect circular sequence, similar to a clock face, is not distinctly recognizable. The sequence of numbers appears more ornamental and does not form a complete circular sequence from I to XII.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the decorative patterns exhibit clear embossed relief with visible depth and shadowing, indicating raised surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The label on the bottle in Image B shows patterns with visual effects that create an illusion of depth, simulating an embossed or relief effect. The shadows and highlights suggest that these design elements appear raised against the flat background of the label, which indicates a clear embossed relief.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a clearly defined central circular element positioned at the geometric center of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the geometric center of the bottle's label, the text 'TIMELESS RESERVE' is encased within a circular element. This circular design is clearly defined, positioned centrally, and serves as the focal point of the label.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are small decorative dots and filigree details integrated into the scrollwork, particularly at junctions and tips of curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The label in Image B features an ornate design, but upon close inspection, it does not showcase the intricate detailing of small decorative dots and filigree specifically at junctions and tips of curves that are typically found in detailed scrollwork patterns. The design around the central circular element is more uniform without these specific details.",
